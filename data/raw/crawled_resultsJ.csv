Public Health Considerations for Correctional Health
PURPOSE
To provide people who are justice system-involved, correctional facility staff, public health professionals, community organizations, and anyone else with an interest in correctional health with resources.
Review CDC resources, guidelines, and data on correctional health and justice-involved populations
Correctional health is community health
CDC provides treatment guidelines and other correctional health resources.
Correctional health encompasses all aspects of health and well-being for adults and juveniles who are justice system*-involved. This starts at the point of arrest, continues at detention or incarceration, and carries through after they return to their community (called ""reentry""). Correctional health also includes the health of families and communities of persons who are justice system-involved, as well as the health administrators and staff who work in facilities.
Justice System-Involved
A person who is 'justice system-involved' is any person who is currently or has ever been arrested or incarcerated in a detention or correctional facility. This term also includes those reentering their communities after detention or incarceration, including those on parole or probation. 'Criminal legal system' may also be used as an alternative to 'justice system' to reflect historic and current challenges to achieving justice in the U.S. criminal legal system.
Persons who are justice system-involved are more likely to experience risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB), latent TB infection (LTBI), and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and concussions. The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries is higher than in the general population. Additionally, a high proportion of people with justice system involvement have a history of unstable housing and mental health and substance use disorders, which increases vulnerability and risk for HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection, and injuries like TBI. This puts many in need of linkage to substance use and mental health treatment, employment, and permanent housing upon release. Justice-involvement also leads to family and community instability and adverse childhood events, with 1 in 28 children having a caregiver who is incarcerated.
Taken together, these multiple health conditions and social determinates of health contribute to the health disparities found in this population and their communities.
CDC has worked to provide people who are justice system-involved, correctional facility staff, public health professionals, community organizations, and anyone else with an interest in correctional health with data, testing and treatment guidelines, educational materials, and other correctional health resources.

Community support
Funds partners working with health departments to improve health in the communities of justice-involved persons, particularly related to priority pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis, STIs, and TB.
Develops programs and guidance that address community health disparities and social determinants of health (SDOH).
Intake / entry
Develops intake screening and treatment guidance for use by clinicians/administrators of correctional health services and health departments.
During incarceration
Works with state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to investigate disease outbreaks.
Develops and provides useful health education materials for staff and justice-involved persons.
Reentry
Supports projects that improve the continuity of care for people returning to their communities.
Offers policy and planning guidance that support efforts to improve the continuity of care within communities.
Surveillance
Identifies/monitors cases and potential exposures to HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, TB, and other pathogens among persons who are justice-involved or work in correctional facilities.
Statistics
The prevalence of infections, diseases, and injuries among people who are incarcerated is higher than in the general population.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
, over 5 million people are estimated to be under the supervision of U.S. adult correctional systems (in prison or jail, or on probation or parole). Many persons who are justice-involved experience multiple risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI), and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and concussions. The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries among people who are incarcerated is higher than in the general population.
HIV
In 2021, about 1.1% of persons incarcerated in state and federal prisons were known to be persons with HIV; this rate was three times higher than the prevalence in the general U.S. population.
In 2021, 16 U.S. states conducted mandatory HIV testing of all persons under state law enforcement custody, and 23 states and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons offered opt-out HIV testing, accounting for 84% of all persons admitted and sentenced to more than 1 year in the custody of state and federal correctional authorities.
In a 2013 survey of women across 20 metropolitan areas with high HIV prevalence, women who were recently incarcerated were significantly more likely to have factors that increase their risk for HIV infection than those who were never incarcerated, including receiving money or drugs in exchange for sex with a partner, multiple casual partners, multiple casual condomless partners, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis.
More information on HIV surveillance in the United States.
Viral hepatitis
In 2009, a systematic review of 23 studies from incarcerated populations in the U.S. reported a wide chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence range of 0.9%–11.4%.
HBV prevalence has been estimated to be 3 to 38 times higher in correctional settings than in the general population in 2009.
From 2013–2016, people who were incarcerated were estimated to have a rate of current hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 10 times higher (10.7% vs 1%) than persons in the general population.
Approximately 30% of all persons infected with HCV in the United States spend at least part of the year in correctional facilities.
More information on Viral Hepatitis surveillance in the United States.
STIs
Males and females 35 years of age and younger in juvenile and adult detention facilities have been reported to have higher rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea than nonincarcerated persons in the community.
Jail-based chlamydia screen-and-treat programs can potentially decrease chlamydia prevalence in communities with higher incarceration rates —as much as 13% in large communities and 54% in small communities.
More information on STIs among persons in correctional facilities.
Tuberculosis (TB)
In 2021, 2.4% of persons 15 years of age or older diagnosed with tuberculosis were current residents of correctional facilities at the time of diagnosis.
From 2003–2013, annual median tuberculosis incidence was about 6 times higher for persons in jails and federal prisons compared with the general population.
An analysis during 2011–2019 demonstrated that large tuberculosis outbreaks still occur in state prisons and account for a large proportion of total tuberculosis cases in some states.
For more information on TB risk and people who live or work in correctional facilities.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
Research in the United States and from other countries suggests almost half (46%) of people in correctional or detention facilities such as prisons and jails have a history of TBI, but the exact number is not known.
Studies show an association between people in correctional or detention facilities with a history of TBI and mental health problems, such as severe depression and anxiety, substance use disorders, difficulty controlling anger, and suicidal thoughts and/or attempts.
People in correctional or detention facilities with TBI-related problems may not be screened for a TBI or may face challenges with getting TBI-related care. These challenges may continue after a person is released from the facility.

MAY 15, 2024
About Japanese Encephalitis
KEY POINTS
Japanese encephalitis virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito.
Most people with Japanese encephalitis do not have symptoms or have only mild symptoms.
Some people develop inflammation of the brain, with symptoms including headache, fever, disorientation, seizures, weakness, and coma.
Vaccination is recommended for some travelers.
Overview
Japanese encephalitis virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Culex species mosquitoes, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Japanese encephalitis virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. For most travelers to Asia, the risk for Japanese encephalitis is very low but varies based on destination, length of travel, season, and activities.
Most people infected with Japanese encephalitis do not have symptoms or have only mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of infected people develop inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), with symptoms including headache, fever, disorientation, seizures, weakness, and coma. Among patients who develop encephalitis, about 1 in 4 (20–30%) die.
The best way to prevent Japanese encephalitis is to protect yourself from mosquito bites. Vaccination is recommended for some travelers.

Why get vaccinated?
Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine can prevent Japanese encephalitis.
Japanese encephalitis occurs mainly in many parts of Asia and the Western Pacific, particularly in rural areas.
It is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It does not spread from person to person.
Risk is very low for most travelers. It is higher for people living in areas where the disease is common, or for people traveling there for long periods of time.
Most people infected with JE virus don't have any symptoms. Others might have symptoms as mild as a fever and headache, or as serious as encephalitis (swelling of the brain).
A person with encephalitis can experience fever, neck stiffness, seizures, and coma. About 1 person in 4 with encephalitis dies. Up to half of those who don't die have permanent disability (for example, brain damage).
It is believed that infection in a pregnant woman could harm her unborn baby.
JE vaccine
Japanese encephalitis vaccine is approved for people 2 months of age and older.
It is recommended for people who:
Plan to live in a country where JE occurs.
Plan to visit a country where JE occurs for long periods (e.g., one month or more).
Frequently travel to countries where JE occurs.
It should also be considered for travelers spending less than one month in a country where JE occurs, if they:
Will visit rural areas and have an increased risk for mosquito bites.
Are not sure of their travel plans.
Many laboratory workers at risk for exposure to JE virus will also require vaccination.
The vaccine is given as a 2-dose series. A booster dose is recommended after a year for people who remain at risk.
NOTE: The best way to prevent JE is to avoid mosquito bites. Your health care provider can advise you.
Talk with your health care provider
Tell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine:
Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of JE vaccine, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies.
Is pregnant. Pregnant women should usually not get JE vaccine.
Will be traveling for fewer than 30 days and only traveling to urban areas. You might not need the vaccine.
In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone JE vaccination to a future visit.
People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting JE vaccine.
Your health care provider can give you more information.
Risks of a vaccine reaction
Pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given are common after JE vaccine.
Fever sometimes happens (more often in children).
Headache or muscle aches can occur (mainly in adults).
Studies have shown that severe reactions to JE vaccine are very rare.
People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.
As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.
What if there is a serious problem?
An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital.
For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider.
Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website
or call 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff do not give medical advice.
How can I learn more?

Self-Care for Arthritis: Five Ways to Manage Your Symptoms
KEY POINTS
There are many things you can do to manage arthritis symptoms.
The things you do to manage your condition and stay healthy are called ""self-management"" or ""self-care.""
Here are five of the most effective things you can do—without medicine—to control arthritis pain and symptoms.
Why it matters
Managing arthritis can help relieve your symptoms so you can do the activities that are important to you. It can also help you manage other chronic conditions you may have, such as diabetes, heart disease, or obesity.
Things you can do right away
Follow these five key steps to manage your arthritis:
1. Learn the skills you need to manage arthritis
Learn the skills you need and gain confidence to manage your condition.
There are low-cost self-management education workshops (about $25–$35) across the country.
These workshops can help you learn to manage pain, exercise safely, and gain control of your arthritis.
2. Be active
Research shows physical activity for arthritis:
Reduces pain.
Improves physical function.
Delays physical limitations that can be caused by arthritis.
All adults, including those with arthritis, should try to get at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) each week of moderate physical activity, such as fast walking or bicycling.
Meeting the recommended guidelines
You can make it easier to get the recommended (150 minutes a week of) physical activity by:
Choosing activities that you enjoy.
Breaking it up into small chunks—for example, 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.
Taking personal or group exercise programs.
If you are not able to meet the recommendation, be as active as you can. Even small amounts of physical activity can have some health benefits.
Learn about CDC-recognized physical activity programs for people with arthritis.
Get started on Walk With Ease
Walk With Ease is a CDC-recognized program that can help you increase your physical activity safely and comfortably. Register for a free copy of the guidebook (for U.S. residents) to get started at your own pace.
3. Keep a healthy weight
Keeping a healthy weight can help slow arthritis symptoms from getting worse so you can keep doing the activities you enjoy.
For adults who have overweight or obesity, even a small amount of weight loss can help reduce arthritis-related pain and disability.
Even a 5%, or 12-pound loss, for a 250-pound person can help.
Eating a healthy diet can relieve joint pressure.
4. See your health care provider
If you have arthritis (especially inflammatory arthritis), it is important that a health care provider detect it early.
Health care providers can recommend physical activity and other ways to manage arthritis without medicine so you can maintain a good quality of life.
If medicines are needed to help you cope with symptoms, health care providers can prescribe them.
This may be the case with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritis conditions.
Talk to a health care provider about your pain and symptoms.
5. Protect your joints
Avoiding injuries to joints can reduce the chances of getting osteoarthritis or making it worse.
Doing sports or jobs that have repetitive motions, such as repeated knee bending, put people at higher risk for this type of arthritis.
Check out these resources for tips on how to prevent joint injuries at work, in sports, and from falls:
Prevent osteoarthritis through weight management, sports injury prevention, and falls prevention
