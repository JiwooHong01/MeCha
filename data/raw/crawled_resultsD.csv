Change in the Reporting of Marriage and Divorce Statistics
Information on the total numbers and rates of marriages and divorces at the national and State levels are published in the NCHS National Vital Statistics Reports. The collection of detailed data was suspended beginning in January 1996. Limitations in the information collected by the States as well as budgetary considerations necessitated this action. The most recent comprehensive analyses of detailed marriage and divorce data are published in Advance Report of Final Marriage Statistics, 1989-90 and Advance Report of Final Divorce Statistics, 1989-90.
  Notice
Births, Marriages, Divorces, and Deaths: Provisional Data for 2009 is the final issue of the monthly provisional data series.
See the NVSR Monthly Provisional Notice for more information.
  Detailed State Tables
Beginning with the June 2003 data, detailed State tables of marriage and divorce levels have been included in the monthly reports of provisional data published in the NCHS National Vital Statistics Reports.  Prior years of data are also available from the National Vital Statistics Reports homepage.
Marriage and divorce rates currently may be calculated from provisional counts received from State health departments. Trend marriage and divorce rates by State for 1990, 1995, and 2000-2022 are available. National marriage and divorce rate trends for 2000-2022 are also available.

  Other Sources of Marriage and Divorce Statistics
The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), conducted by NCHS, collected detailed data on cohabitation, marriage, divorce and remarriage.  These data were published in Series 23, Number 22, “Cohabitation, Marriage, Divorce and Remarriage in the United States” and in National Health Statistics Report, Number 49, “First Marriages in the United States: Data from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth“.
The U.S. Census Bureau
is another Federal source of marriage and divorce statistics. Census data are survey-based rather than records-based and cover many aspects of marriage and divorce patterns in the United States.

FUNGAL DISEASES
APRIL 24, 2024
Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections Basics
KEY POINTS
Ringworm (dermatophytosis) is a common fungal infection of hair, skin, or nails.
Athlete's foot, jock itch, and most fungal nail infections are forms of ringworm.
On the skin, it usually causes an itchy, red, ring-shaped rash.
Nail infections (onychomycosis) may cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily.
What it is
Ringworm (tinea) is a common fungal infection of the hair (tinea capitis), skin, or nails (onychomycosis). It gets its name from the ring-shaped, itchy, red rash it causes on skin.
Ringworm is more common on certain parts of the body. Ringworm on the feet (tinea pedis) is often referred to as athlete's foot. Ringworm on the groin (tinea cruris) is often called jock itch.
Ringworm is a common type of fungal nail infection (onychomycosis). It can cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily. Although infections are much more common in toenails, fingernails can get infected. Fungal nail infections can lead to infections on the skin of the foot.
Health Care Providers:
Clinical Overview of Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections
Health Care Providers:
Emerging Severe and Antimicrobial-Resistant Ringworm
Causes
Ringworm is caused by fungi (not a worm). The scientific names for the most common fungi that cause ringworm are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton.
Ringworm is very common and can be spread by:
Skin-to-skin contact with people or animals with the infection
Shared objects (e.g., towels, bed sheets)
Shared surfaces (e.g., locker room floors)
Risk factors include:
Use of public showers or locker rooms without protective footwear
Participating in contact sports like wrestling
Wearing tight shoes and socks
Excessive sweating
Close contact with animals
Protect Yourself from Ringworm
Help protect yourself and others from ringworm.
MAY 9, 2024
Anyone can get ringworm, but people who have weakened immune systems may be especially at risk for infection. They may also have problems fighting off a ringworm infection.
Keep Reading:
What Causes Ringworm
Testing
If you have a rash, nail infection, or symptoms of ringworm, go to a healthcare provider for testing. You may go to your primary care provider, dermatologist, or podiatrist. Symptoms of ringworm are similar to symptoms for other skin or nail conditions. Testing can help make sure you get the right treatment.
Ask your healthcare provider to test for ringworm infections.
Healthcare providers may take a small skin scraping or nail sample for testing.
Treatment
The treatment for ringworm depends on its location on the body and how serious the infection is. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription (over-the-counter) antifungal medications. However, other forms of ringworm need treatment with prescription antifungal medication.
Keep Reading:
Treatment of Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections
Do not use steroid creams for rashes that could be ringworm.
Steroids (or corticosteroids) are in many over-the-counter creams for rashes. Steroid creams can make ringworm infections worse. If you have a ringworm or a rash that could be ringworm, do not use creams containing steroids.

Developmental Disability Basics
WHAT TO KNOW
Developmental disabilities are a group of conditions due to an impairment in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas.
These conditions begin during the child's developmental period, may impact day-to-day functioning, and usually last throughout a person's lifetime.
Most developmental disabilities begin before a baby is born, but some can happen after birth because of injury, infection, or other factors.
Causes and risk factors
Most developmental disabilities are thought to be caused by a complex mix of factors. These factors include genetics; parental health and behaviors (such as smoking and drinking) during pregnancy; complications during birth; infections the mother might have during pregnancy or the baby might have very early in life; and exposure of the mother or child to high levels of environmental toxins, such as lead. For some developmental disabilities, such as fetal alcohol syndrome, which is caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy, we know the cause. But for most, we don’t.
Following are some examples of what we know about specific developmental disabilities:
At least 25% of hearing loss among babies is due to maternal infections during pregnancy, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; complications after birth; and head trauma.
Some of the most common known causes of intellectual disability include fetal alcohol syndrome disorder; genetic and chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome; and certain infections during pregnancy.
Children who have a sibling with autism spectrum disorder are at a higher risk of also having autism spectrum disorder.
Low birthweight, premature birth, multiple birth, and infections during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for many developmental disabilities.
Untreated newborn jaundice (high levels of bilirubin in the blood during the first few days after birth) can cause a type of brain damage known as kernicterus. Children with kernicterus are more likely to have cerebral palsy, hearing and vision problems, and problems with their teeth. Early detection and treatment of newborn jaundice can prevent kernicterus.
The Study to Explore Early Development (SEED) is a multiyear study funded by CDC. It is currently the largest study in the United States to help identify factors that may put children at risk for autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities.
Keep Reading:
Learn More About SEED
Who is affected
Developmental disabilities occur among all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Recent estimates in the United States show that about 1 in 6, or about 17%, of children aged 3 through 17 years have one or more developmental disabilities, such as
ADHD
Autism spectrum disorder
Cerebral palsy
Hearing loss
Fragile X syndrome
Tourette syndrome
and other developmental disabilities1
For more than a decade, CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network has been tracking the number and characteristics of children with autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, and intellectual disability in several diverse communities throughout the United States.
Keep Reading:
CDC's Tracking Method for Autism Spectrum Disorder
Keep Reading:
CDC's Tracking Method for Cerebral Palsy
Healthy living for people with disabilities
Children and adults with disabilities need health care and health programs for the same reasons anyone else does—to stay well, active, and a part of the community.
Having a disability does not mean a person is not healthy or that he or she cannot be healthy. Being healthy means the same thing for all of us—getting and staying well so we can lead full, active lives. That includes having the tools and information to make healthy choices and knowing how to prevent illness. Some health conditions, such as asthma, gastrointestinal symptoms, eczema and skin allergies, and migraine headaches, have been found to be more common among children with developmental disabilities. Thus, it is especially important for children with developmental disabilities to see a health care provider regularly.
Keep Reading:
Learn More About Healthy Living
CDC does not study education or treatment programs for people with developmental disabilities, nor does it provide direct services to people with developmental disabilities or to their families. However, CDC has put together a list of resources for people affected by developmental disabilities.

Flu and People with Diabetes
WHAT TO KNOW
It is important for people with diabetes to get annual flu vaccinations to prevent flu and serious flu complications.
People with diabetes should avoid the nasal spray flu vaccine, opting for injectable vaccines.
If you have diabetes and experience flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away.
CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with diabetes who have flu infection or suspected flu infection.
Background
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant). More than 122 million Americans are living with diabetes (37.3 million) or prediabetes (96 million). People with diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational), even when well-managed, are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. These complications can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death. Flu-related complications include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections. About 30% of adults hospitalized with flu reported to the CDC had diabetes in recent seasons. Acute illnesses like the flu can make controlling blood sugar levels harder. The flu may raise blood sugar levels. For example, a reduced appetite when sick can cause blood sugar levels to fall. People with diabetes need to follow the sick day guidelines if they become ill.
Vaccination is the best protection against flu
Flu vaccination is especially important for people with diabetes because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. Flu vaccination also has been associated with reduced hospitalizations among people with diabetes (79%)
.
Flu Vaccines for People with Diabetes
Injectable influenza vaccines (flu shots) are recommended for use in people with diabetes and certain other health conditions. Flu shots have a long, established safety record and studies
support the safety of flu vaccines in people with diabetes.
People with diabetes should generally not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine (i.e., the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV). Your doctor or other health care professional can answer any questions you might have about flu vaccine.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also important
Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death.
People with diabetes should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccination helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections.
You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine.
Pneumococcal vaccination should be part of a diabetes management plan. Talk to your healthcare provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.
Other Preventive Actions for People with Diabetes
In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with diabetes should follow the CDC's everyday preventive actions. These include avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. They can also take steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.

Preventing Respiratory Viruses
Specific Health Actions for People with Diabetes
Plan to maintain sufficient supplies of your regular medications for chronic conditions.
Ensure you have a least a two-week supply of necessary medications on hand.
If you experience flu symptoms, call your healthcare provider right away. Antiviral drugs can treat flu illness and may prevent serious flu complications. CDC recommends prompt flu treatment for people who have flu infection or suspected flu infection.

Dialysis Safety
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
MARCH 26, 2024
Infections and Patients on Dialysis
KEY POINTS
If you are a patient on dialysis, you are at risk for infections.
Each dialysis treatment option has varying risks for infection.
You can take steps to help prevent infections while receiving dialysis.
Overview
Your kidneys play a vital role in cleaning your blood, eliminating waste from your body, and supporting other important functions. Dialysis is a medical treatment for kidney failure or kidneys that do not work right. It is not a cure to restore kidney function.
Infections are common among people receiving dialysis and can be very serious.
Everyone has a role to play in preventing infections and improving dialysis patient safety. You can be a safe patient and take action to help prevent infections.
Dialysis treatment options
In-center hemodialysis
Home hemodialysis
Peritoneal dialysis (PD)
Each treatment option has varying risks for infection. Discuss treatment options with your doctor to decide which is best based on your needs.
Infection risk and terms to know
Vein access: also known as vascular access, moves blood between your body and the dialysis machine during hemodialysis treatments.
Arteriovenous (AV) fistula: access to the bloodstream created when doctors surgically join an artery and a vein, often in the arm. Once healed, hemodialysis takes place through the fistula. This access type lasts longer than a graft and has the lowest risk of infection.
Arteriovenous (AV) graft: access to the bloodstream created when doctors put in a tube that connects an artery and vein. This access type has a higher risk of infection than an AV fistula, but lower than a central line catheter.
Central line catheter: access to the bloodstream created by inserting a tube through the skin into a vein. The tube enters through a vein in the neck, chest, or groin and the tip of the tube ends near the heart. This access type is for short-term use and quick placement, and also has the highest risk of infection.
Healthcare providers may use a central line catheter if treatment needs to begin soon, you have damaged veins and arteries or you experience barriers to other types of vein access.
View LargerDownload
Reducing the use of central venous catheters for people on dialysis can help prevent bloodstream infections.
How germs spread
When someone is sick with a respiratory infection in a dialysis facility, you can breathe in respiratory droplets after a sick person coughs or sneezes. Germs can also spread through contact with contaminated equipment surfaces, through unclean hands or through vein access points when proper infection control processes are not used.
Steps to take
Keep your hands clean and cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.
Learn about the dialysis process: know what to expect during treatment and things healthcare staff do to protect you from infections.
Watch the CDC's Speak Up video for questions to ask during your dialysis treatments.
Check your access daily and notify staff if you notice any of these signs of infection:
Redness
Pus or unusual drainage
Swelling
Notify staff if your catheter bandage gets dirty or wet.
Ask staff if you can use a fistula or graft for treatment if you have a central line catheter.
Make sure all staff clean their hands before and after caring for you or your access.
In some cases, you may need to take extra actions to prevent infections. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Possible infections
Bloodstream infections (BSIs), most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (staph).
Some types of staph may be resistant to antibiotics, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Chronic viral infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV.
Intestinal and respiratory infections such as C.diff. (Clostridioides difficile) and Flu (Influenza).
Resources
CDC has posters and fact sheets to help patients prevent infections while receiving dialysis.

SEPTEMBER 6, 2024
Riot Control Agents
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that cause irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Several different compounds are riot control agents:
Chloroacetophenone (CN)
Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS)
Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant
Bromobenzylcyanide (CA)
Dibenzoxazepine (CR)
Combinations of various agents.
Where it is found
Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray).
CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks.
How it works
Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure.
The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off.
Signs and symptoms
The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors).
People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure:
Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness
Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling
Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling
Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath
Skin: burns, rash
Other: nausea and vomiting
Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as:
Blindness
Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess
Immediate death due to severe chemical burns to the throat and lungs
Respiratory failure possibly resulting in death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to riot control agents.
Exposure
Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles.
If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in.
What to do if you are exposed
Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents.
If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground.
If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe.
Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes.
Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages.
No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents.
Long-term health effects
Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following:
Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness)
Eye scarring
Cataracts
Breathing problems, such as asthma
These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors.
If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

PARASITES 
FEBRUARY 21, 2024
About Dientamoeba fragilis
KEY POINTS
Dientamoeba fragilis is a parasite that lives in your large intestine.
People most likely get infected by accidentally swallowing the parasite.
Many infected people do not have any symptoms.
To prevent infections, wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or changing diapers, and before preparing food.
Overview
Dientamoeba fragilis is a protozoan parasite, meaning it is a microscopic, single-celled organism that multiplies in people. D. fragilis lives in the large intestine of people. It is still not entirely clear whether this organism causes disease in people. Many people carrying the parasite have no symptoms, but gut-related symptoms have been associated with this parasite in some people. Infection is common in the United States and globally.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Dientamoeba fragilis page.
Signs and symptoms
Many people have no symptoms. If symptoms are present, the most common are diarrhea and/or abdominal pain. Other symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.
Causes
It is unclear how D. fragilis spreads. Most likely, people get infected by accidentally swallowing the parasite; this is called fecal-oral transmission. This could be through contaminated food or water, person-to-person, or animal fecal (poop) contact. The D. fragilis parasite is fragile and cannot live very long in the environment (after it passes in feces) or in stomach acid (after it is swallowed).
Prevention
To prevent infection with D. fragilis,
Wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet, after changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food.
Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for D. fragilis infection. You may have to submit stool samples from more than one day as the parasite is not in every sample. People infected with D. fragilis can also have pinworm eggs. Your healthcare provider may test for both.
Treatment and recovery
Safe and effective medications are available to treat D. fragilis infection. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you may have D. fragilis infection.

Diphtheria Vaccination
KEY POINTS
CDC recommends diphtheria vaccination for everyone.
Diphtheria vaccines are the best way to protect against diphtheria and are very effective.
Talk to a vaccine provider if you have questions about diphtheria vaccines.
Overview
View LargerDownload
CDC recommends diphtheria vaccines for people of all ages.
There are 3 types of combination vaccines that include protection against diphtheria:
DTaP
Td
Tdap
The letter ""T"" in DTaP and Tdap shows they also help protect against tetanus. The letter ""P/p"" in DTaP and Tdap shows they also help protect against whooping cough (pertussis).

Diphtheria Vaccine Recommendations
Allergies, reactions: Talk with a vaccine provider
Talk to a vaccine provider about your vaccination history and a specific vaccine's ingredients. There may be times when someone shouldn't get DTaP, Td, or Tdap, like if they:
Had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the vaccine(s)
Have a life-threatening allergy to any part of the vaccine(s)
Additionally, discuss with a vaccine provider if a different vaccine other than DTaP or Tdap should be used. A vaccine provider may recommend a different vaccine if someone experienced encephalopathy within 7 days of receiving DTaP or Tdap. Encephalopathy is a brain disease that alters how the brain functions.
Feeling sick?
Generally, vaccination is fine during mild illnesses like a cold. A vaccine provider can advise on whether to get vaccinated or wait until you feel better.
Other guidelines
Tell the vaccine provider if you or your child:
Has seizures or another nervous system problem
Has ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (also called ""GBS"")
Had severe pain or swelling after a tetanus or diphtheria vaccine
How well they work
Vaccines that help protect against diphtheria work well but can't prevent all cases.

Possible side effects
Most people who get a vaccine that helps protect against diphtheria don't have any serious problems. With any medicine, including vaccines, there's a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days, but serious reactions are possible.
DTaP vaccine
Swelling or soreness where the vaccine provider gave the vaccine
Fever
Irritability (fussiness)
Feeling tired
Loss of appetite
Vomiting
Td and Tdap vaccines
Pain, redness, or swelling where the vaccine provider gave the vaccine
Mild fever
Headache
Feeling tired
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomachache
More serious reactions
More serious reactions after DTaP vaccination happen much less often than mild problems. They can include:
Seizures
Non-stop crying for 3 hours or more
High fever (over 105°F)
Rarely, DTaP vaccination is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg. While rare, if it happens it's usually in older children when they receive their fourth or fifth shot.

Vaccination locations
Children and teens
DTaP and Tdap are part of the routine childhood immunization schedule and regularly available for children at:
Pediatric and family practice offices
Community health clinics
Public health departments
Adults
For adults, a healthcare provider's office or pharmacy are usually the best places to receive recommended vaccines. If your healthcare provider doesn't have Td or Tdap vaccines, ask for a referral.
Federally funded health centers can also provide services if you don't have a regular source of health care. Locate one near you
.
You can also contact your health department to learn more about where to get vaccines in your community.
Vaccine costs
There are several ways to cover the cost of DTaP, Td, and Tdap vaccines:
Private health insurance
Most private health insurance plans cover this vaccine. Check with your insurance provider for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children program
The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program provides vaccines to children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them.

About Diphyllobothrium
KEY POINTS
Diphyllobothriids are the largest parasitic tapeworms that can infect people.
You can get infected by eating raw or undercooked fish.
You can treat Diphyllobothriid infection with medication.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Dibothriocephalus latus, and related species (belonging to the family Diphyllobothriidae, also called fish or broad tapeworms), are the largest tapeworms to infect people. They can grow to up to 30 feet long. Most people infected with fish tapeworms have no symptoms. However, complications can include intestinal obstruction (blockages in the intestines) and gall bladder disease. This happens when the segments of the tapeworm (called proglottids) move or migrate in the body. Several different Diphyllobothriid species infect humans.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Diphyllobothriid Tapeworm Infection page.
Signs and symptoms
Most people with fish tapeworm infection have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they can include
Abdominal discomfort
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Weight loss
Vitamin B12 deficiency leading to anemia
Complications include intestinal obstruction and gall bladder disease caused by migration of proglottids (segments of the tapeworm). If you think you have a fish tapeworm infection, see your healthcare provider.
Causes
You can get Diphyllobothriid tapeworm infection by eating raw or undercooked fish from many parts of the world. One type of fish tapeworm infects freshwater fish such as trout, perch, or pike. It is found in the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, independent states of the Former Soviet Union, North America, Asia), and rarely in the southern hemisphere countries. Other species of fish tapeworm infect fish which live in both fresh and salt water, such as salmon. Fish infected with tapeworm larvae may be sent to and eaten in any area of the world.
Prevention
The easiest way to prevent Diphyllobothriid infection is to not eat raw or undercooked fish. Adequately freezing or cooking fish will kill the parasite. The FDA recommends the following for fish preparation or storage to kill parasites.
Cooking
Cook fish adequately (to an internal temperature of at least 145° F [~63° C])
Freezing
At -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid, and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours
Salting, smoking, or pickling fish does not kill the parasite.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for fish tapeworm eggs or segments of the tapeworm with a microscope. You may need to submit more than one sample to confirm a diagnosis due to low numbers of eggs present.
Treatment and recovery
There are safe and effective medicines available to treat fish tapeworm infection. Talk to your healthcare provider about treatment.

Dirofilariasis
EXPLORE TOPICS

PARASITES 
MAY 2, 2024
About Dirofilariasis
KEY POINTS
Dilofilariasis is an infection caused by parasitic roundworms.
In dogs, it is called heartworm infection.
Infection is spread by mosquito bites.
Overview
Dirofilaria are long, thin parasitic roundworms that infect a variety of mammals. Infection is transmitted by mosquito bites. There are many species of Dirofilaria, but human infection is caused most commonly by three species, D. immitis, D. repens, and D. tenuis. The main natural hosts for these three species are dogs and wild canids, such as foxes and wolves (D. immitis and D. repens) and raccoons (D. tenuis). D. immitis is also known as ""heartworm."" D. repens is not found in the United States, and D. tenuis appears to be restricted to raccoons in North America.
Dirofilariasis is the disease caused by Dirofilaria worm infections. In dogs, one form is called ""heartworm disease"" and is caused by D. immitis. D. immitis adult worms can cause pulmonary artery blockage in dogs, leading to an illness that can include cough, exhaustion upon exercise, fainting, coughing up blood, and severe weight loss.
Symptoms
Human infections with D. immitis can result in areas of inflammation induced by dying adult worms in pulmonary arteries that appear as coin lesions on chest x-rays. Coin lesions can also be caused by cancer and other serious diseases, and a coin lesion discovered accidentally on chest x-ray usually leads to an invasive procedure to learn the cause. Most human cases of pulmonary dirofilariasis are diagnosed from samples taken during these procedures. Most reported cases of D. immitis infection in humans have been in persons with no symptoms. People with symptoms can have cough (including coughing up blood), chest pain, fever, and pleural effusion (excess fluid between the tissues that line the lungs and the chest cavity). Rarely, D. immitis worms have been found in humans at outside the lungs, including the brain, eye, and testicle. When D. repens and D. tenuis infection is reported in humans, it is generally as the cause of nodules under the skin, but on occasion, worms are found in the conjunctiva.
Who is at risk
Dirofilariasis is found throughout the world where Dirofilaria species are common. In the United States, canine dirofilariasis has been reported from all states, and D. tenuis in raccoons is common in many areas where raccoons are found. Canine and human dirofilariasis are most prevalent in eastern and southeastern states, although rates are increasing rapidly in a number of western states. D. immitis is the Dirofilaria species most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis in humans in the United States. D. repens is the Dirofilaria species most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis among humans in Europe. One or both of these species have been found to cause human dirofilariasis in other parts of the world.
How it spreads
The definitive mammalian hosts for Dirofilaria are primarily domestic dogs, wild canids (such as wolves and foxes), and raccoons. In these hosts, sexually mature worms produce microfilariae that circulate in the blood and are ingested by mosquitoes during a blood meal. In mosquitoes, the microfilariae develop into larvae that migrate to the proboscis (the long, tubular part of the mouth of the mosquito that punctures the skin during a blood meal), where they are ready to infect another host during a blood meal. Several types of mosquitoes are capable of transmitting Dirofilaria infection, including Aedes, Anopheles, and Mansonia.
Humans and a wide range of other mammals are accidental hosts that play no role in the transmission of Dirofilaria. In these hosts, Dirofilaria larvae can develop into adult worms but the worms remain sexually immature and no microfilariae are produced.
Resource
DPDx - Dirofilaria life cycle
Prevention
Dirofilariasis can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites in areas where mosquitoes may be infected with Dirofilaria larvae. The risk of such mosquito bites can be reduced by leaving as little skin exposed as possible, by the use of insect repellent when exposed to mosquitoes, and by sleeping under an insecticide-treated bednet in areas where Dirofilaria-infected mosquitoes bite at night and have access to sleeping areas.
Diagnosis
In humans, dirofilariasis is diagnosed most frequently by the examination of tissue from areas of inflammation in the lung obtained as part of the diagnostic investigation of coin lesions (small, round abnormalities) on chest x-rays or from the examination of tissue in nodules under the skin. Blood tests are not yet helpful in the diagnosis of dirofilariasis in humans.
Treatment
The definitive treatment of Dirofilaria infection in humans is surgical removal of lung granulomas and nodules under the skin; this treatment is also curative. In many cases, no treatment with medicines is necessary.
This information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for consultation with a health care provider. If you have any questions about the parasites described above or think that you may have a parasitic infection, consult a health care provider.

About Disaster Epidemiology
AT A GLANCE
Disaster epidemiology assesses the short- and long-term health effects of disasters to help guide emergency response, recovery efforts, and predict consequences of future disasters.
Overview
Collecting health and needs information during a disaster helps to provide situational awareness. When we know what is happening, we can determine what the needs are, plan the response, and gather the appropriate resources. These actions can help to decrease mortality and morbidity and improve prevention and mitigation strategies for future disasters.
Typically, the main objectives of disaster epidemiology are the following:
Prevent or reduce the number of deaths, illnesses, and injuries caused by disasters
Provide timely and accurate health information for decision-makers
Improve prevention and mitigation strategies for future disasters by gaining information for future response preparation
Available tools
State, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health departments should look first at the tools they are using in non-disaster settings to assess their applicability for adaption to a disaster response.
CDC provides various tools for public health disaster response including template forms for morbidity surveillance, mortality surveillance, shelter assessments, and the Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response, CASPER toolkit.
Request CDC assistance
CDC provides scientific consultation, technical assistance, and disaster epidemiology training to STLT, federal, and international public health partners to help them respond to natural and human-induced disasters. There are several ways you can request CDC assistance.
If you would like more information on CDC consultation, technical assistance, or disaster epidemiology training, please visit the training and technical assistance webpage.
Public health surveillance during a disaster
Public health surveillance is the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of deaths, injuries, and illnesses to provide information about any adverse health effects related to a disaster event in a community. It allows us to assess the human health impacts of a disaster and evaluate potential problems related to planning and prevention.
Purpose
Public health morbidity surveillance allows us to detect disease outbreaks and track disease and injury trends. A common myth is that epidemics are inevitable during a disaster. Early detection and response, however, can lessen the likelihood for outbreaks. Additionally, conducting health surveillance allows public health leaders and decision makers to make informed decisions about action items such as allocating resources, tailoring interventions to meet specific needs, and planning for future disasters.
In addition to public health morbidity surveillance, mortality surveillance can provide information that can prevent excess death. The number of deaths is a strong indicator of the impact of the disaster.
Disasters can overwhelm local medical examiners and emergency systems, disrupting typical reporting methods. Most mortality surveillance data (such as Vital Statistics) are collected in a way that is not timely or detailed enough to be useful for disaster response. Thus, implementing active mortality surveillance following a disaster provides a critical aspect to response.
Available tools
CDC has several ready-to-use templates for morbidity and mortality surveillance. These tools can supplement existing surveillance systems or replace surveillance systems that have been hindered or destroyed due to a disaster. For more information, review the Tools and Resources page.
Creating a surveillance system
During disasters, several steps may need to be conducted simultaneously when planning a surveillance system. Just as purpose and objective should be clear in any disaster response effort, the surveillance system should have well-defined objectives. Additionally, data sources need to be identified and selected.
Facility-based surveillance of hospitals and emergency medical operations can provide information on those seeking care during a disaster, yet there is often the need to use additional nontraditional sources of information (such as a shelters, pharmacies, or physician offices) as well. Ideally, data collection instruments for surveillance should be developed, tested, and distributed before the disaster occurs (e.g., CDC-developed surveillance tools). However, these instruments will need to be modified for each disaster and location.
The data collection instrument should collect only the most essential information and should have easy data entry. For information to be useful, it must be disseminated in a timely fashion through appropriate channels (e.g., public health and other government officials, relief workers, the affected community, and the media).

Public Health Surveillance During a Disaster
Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER)
The Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) is a type of rapid needs assessment (RNA). The assessment is designed to provide public health leaders and emergency managers with household-based information about a community. It is quick, reliable, relatively inexpensive, and flexible.
CASPER uses valid statistical methods to gather information. They can be conducted throughout the disaster cycle (preparedness, response, recovery, mitigation) and in non-disaster situations.
The information generated can be used to:
Initiate public health action
Identify information gaps
Facilitate disaster planning, response, and recovery activities
Allocate resources
Assess new or changing needs in the community
Epidemiologic studies
Public health disaster studies help identify associations between disasters and mortality or morbidity. It can also help evaluate programs or response techniques to yield decisions and assess the successfulness of the program or response.
CDC conducts epidemiologic studies and research on various disaster-related topics. Our subject matter experts also provide technical assistance to partners in conducting their own research.

Disaster Science Responder Research Program
WHAT TO KNOW
This page describes the Disaster Science Responder Research (DSRR) Program. The program develops and implements tools, partnerships, and procedures to allow for real-time research during public health threats (PHTs). The program also identifies and conducts research to perform outside the scope of an emergency to protect workers in the future.
Overview
The DSRR Program considers all workers who may be impacted by a PHT. This includes workers beyond traditional response and recovery workers.
Research conducted when a PHT occurs can include:
Impact of a new exposure
Unexpected or severe health effects
Effectiveness of a proposed intervention
Mental health and resilience issues
Chronic disease outcomes

Disaster Science Responder Research Program
WHAT TO KNOW
This page describes the Disaster Science Responder Research (DSRR) Program. The program develops and implements tools, partnerships, and procedures to allow for real-time research during public health threats (PHTs). The program also identifies and conducts research to perform outside the scope of an emergency to protect workers in the future.
Overview
The DSRR Program considers all workers who may be impacted by a PHT. This includes workers beyond traditional response and recovery workers.
Research conducted when a PHT occurs can include:
Impact of a new exposure
Unexpected or severe health effects
Effectiveness of a proposed intervention
Mental health and resilience issues
Chronic disease outcomes
Research priorities
Strategic Goals

Protecting Emergency Response and Recovery Workers
WHAT TO KNOW
Emergency response and recovery workers are a common denominator at any disaster or novel emergency event.
It is critical to protect emergency response and recovery workers' safety and health throughout an emergency.
Response leaders can use these recommendations to help prevent illnesses, injuries, and fatalities during an emergency.
Overview
Preparedness and response activities should address workers' safety and health during all emergency stages, including before, during, and after an event. This helps to ensure that only qualified, trained, and properly equipped personnel are deployed.
Recommendations
Safety managers, incident command leaders, employers, and other disaster site leaders
Information on potential hazards present or expected at a disaster scene helps to establish necessary safety measures. Safety measures are critical to prevent hazards and reduce potential harmful incidents that can occur at the worksite. Examples of safety measures are described below:
Establish a system to manage personnel during an emergency
Provide training to face a particular hazard
Define the use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
Install guidelines and mechanisms to be used in case of an emergency
The Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance (ERHMS) framework provides recommendations for protecting emergency response and recovery workers. Anyone involved in deploying and protecting emergency response and recovery workers can use the framework. ERHMS includes recommendations for all phases of a response, including:
Pre-Deployment
Deployment
Post-Deployment
Recommendations for people responding to disasters and large-scale incidents are described in a series of reports called Protecting Emergency Responders:
Lessons Learned from Terrorist Attacks
Community Views of Safety and Health Risks and Personal Protection Needs
Safety Management in Disaster and Terrorism Response
PPE Guidelines for Structural Collapse Events

Take steps to protect yourself during a response
What CDC is doing
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) can provide services to people involved in emergency response. Employees, unions, or employers can request an evaluation of possible health hazards associated with a job or workplace. Request an evaluation or email HHERequestHelp@cdc.gov to learn more.
Story from the field
In 2012, NIOSH surveyed emergency response and recovery workers following a vinyl chloride release from a train derailment in New Jersey. The survey was administered to assess:
Experiences from the train derailment
Responder health before and after the vinyl chloride release
Details related to job training
Two resulting reports describe the survey findings and the implications of the release. The Technical Assistance Report and Assessment of Emergency Responders Following Vinyl Chloride Release from a Train Derailment describe:
Health effects responders experienced during the incident
Respiratory protection used
Types of instruction and training responders received

About Children in Disasters
KEY POINTS
Disasters affect children differently than they do adults.
Children have unique needs during and after disasters.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Children are different
Children's bodies are different from adults' bodies
They are more likely to get sick or severely injured.
They breathe in more air per pound of body weight than adults.
They have thinner skin, and more of it per pound of body weight (higher surface-to-mass ratio).
They have less fluid in their bodies, so fluid loss (e.g. dehydration, blood loss) can have a bigger effect on children.
They are more likely to lose too much body heat.
They spend more time outside and on the ground.
They put their hands in their mouths more often than adults.
Children in an emergency
Children need help from adults in an emergency
Children don't fully understand how to keep themselves safe.
Older children and adolescents may take their cues from others.
Young children may cry, scream, or become paralyzed with fear.
They may not be able to explain what hurts or bothers them.
They are more likely to get the care they need when they have parents or other caregivers around.
Adults are required by law to make medical decisions for a child.
Adults will sometimes have to make decisions with limited information on the ways some illnesses and medicines affect children.
Children's mental health
Mental stress from a disaster can be harder on children
They feel less of a sense of control.
They understand less about the situation.
They have fewer experiences bouncing back from hard situations.
Resources
Disasters can strike without any warning. Family members may not all be in the same place.
It's important to make a plan so everyone will know what to do.

Distracted Driving
KEY POINTS
Anything that takes your attention away from driving can be a distraction.
Distracted driving can increase the chance of a motor vehicle crash.
Distracted driving is preventable. Do not multi-task while driving.
Overview
Distracted driving is doing another activity that takes the driver's attention away from driving. Distracted driving can increase the chance of a motor vehicle crash.
There are three main types of distraction:1
Visual: taking your eyes off the road
Manual: taking your hands off the wheel
Cognitive: taking your mind off driving
Sending a text message, talking on a cell phone, using a navigation system, and eating while driving are a few examples of distracted driving. Any of these distractions can endanger you, your passengers, and others on the road.
Impact
Distracted driving impacts thousands of Americans each year.
Nine people in the United States are killed every day in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver.2
In the United States, over 3,100 people were killed and about 424,000 were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver in 2019.2
About 1 in 5 of the people who died in crashes involving a distracted driver in 2019 were not in vehicles―they were walking, riding their bikes, or otherwise outside a vehicle.2
Distracted driving deaths over time
Sources: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2010-2013
, 2014–2018
and 2019
You can visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) website for more information on how data on motor vehicle crash deaths are collected and the limitations of distracted driving data.
People at increased risk
Young adult and teen drivers are more at risk for distracted driving than other age groups. Among fatal crashes involving distracted drivers in the U.S. in 2019 a higher percentage of drivers ages 15–20 were distracted than drivers age 21 and older.2
Keep reading: Distracted Driving Risk Factors
What's being done
State and Federal efforts to prevent distracted driving include:
Many states have enacted laws to help prevent distracted driving.
While the effectiveness of cell phone and texting laws requires further study, high-visibility enforcement efforts for distracted driving laws can be effective in reducing cell phone use while driving.34
NHTSA has several campaigns
to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving, including their annual ""U Drive. U Text. U Pay."" campaign, which began in April 2014.
Keep reading: Preventing Distracted Driving
What you can do
Drivers should not multitask and can use apps
to help avoid cell phone use while driving.
Passengers can speak up if the driver is distracted and can assist with navigation or other tasks.
Parents can set consequences for distracted driving and set an example by keeping their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel while driving.

DECEMBER 19, 2023
About Dog or Cat Tapeworm Infection
KEY POINTS
Dipylidium is a tapeworm of cats and dogs.
It is a parasite that can also infect people.
Dipylidium infection is easily treatable in dogs, cats, and people.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Dipylidium caninum is a common tapeworm of dogs and cats in the United States and throughout the world. Dogs and cats get Dipylidium tapeworm by swallowing a flea infected with a tapeworm larvae, often while grooming themselves. The larval tapeworm will then develop into an adult tapeworm in the animal's intestine. People get Dipylidium tapeworm the same way dogs and cats do, by swallowing a flea infected with tapeworm larvae.
The adult tapeworm is made up of many small segments called proglottids. Each proglottid is about the size of a grain of rice. Adult tapeworms may measure 4 – 28 inches in length. As the tapeworm grows inside the intestine, these segments (proglottids) break off and pass in the stool.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Dipylidium page.
Signs and symptoms
Most dogs and cats infected with Dipylidium tapeworm do not show signs of illness. However, you can sometimes see the proglottids crawling near the animal's anus (butt) or on the surface of a fresh bowel movement. Dried out proglottids look like grains of rice: they are small, about 2 mm, hard, and yellowish in color. You can sometimes see them stuck to the fur around your pet's butt.
Most people infected with Dipylidium tapeworms also do not show signs of illness. It is more likely that you will recognize a Dipylidium infection when you see tapeworm segments in your or your child's feces (poop).
Causes
Dogs and cats get Dipylidium tapeworm by swallowing a flea infected with a tapeworm larvae, often while grooming themselves. The larval tapeworm will then develop into an adult tapeworm in the animal's intestines. The segments of the adult tapeworm, proglottids, break off and pass in the animal's stool. The proglottids contain tapeworm eggs. Once the proglottid dries out, the eggs release into the environment. Flea larvae then feed on the Dipylidium eggs and start the cycle over again.
People get Dipylidium tapeworm the same way dogs and cats do, by swallowing a flea infected with tapeworm larvae. Most reported cases are in children.
Prevention
The most effective way to prevent Dipylidium infection in pets and people is through flea control. Other ways to prevent infection include
Have your veterinarian treat your dogs and cats if they have tapeworms.
Clean up after your pet, especially in playgrounds and public parks. Place the poop in a plastic bag and dispose of it in the trash. If plastic bags or trash are not available, bury it.
Do not allow children to play in areas soiled with pet or other animal feces.
Teach children to always wash their hands after petting or playing with dogs and cats, and after playing outdoors.
Diagnosis
In Dogs and Cats
Your veterinarian will not typically find Dipylidium tapeworm eggs in a routine fecal (poop) exam. They rely on the pet's owner to notice the tapeworm segments (proglottids) crawling around the anus or in the pet's feces.
In People
Most infections in people are diagnosed clinically. This means your healthcare provider will look for the tapeworm segments around a person's anus or in their feces. Your healthcare provider may also do a stool exam to look for eggs or tapeworm segments.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment is simple and very effective for both animals and people. If you think your pet has Dipylidium tapeworms, talk to your veterinarian about treating your pet.
When people have Dipylidium infection, their healthcare provider can prescribe praziquantel to treat the infection. The medication is well-tolerated and causes the tapeworm to dissolve within the intestine.

WHAT TO KNOW
Dogs can sometimes carry germs that can make people and other animals sick.
Wash your hands after handling your dog, its food, waste, or supplies.
Provide routine veterinary care for your dog to keep it healthy and prevent the spread of diseases.
Always supervise young children around dogs, even trusted family pets.
Overview
Dogs can have many positive effects on the lives of their owners. They influence social, emotional, and cognitive development in children, promote an active lifestyle, and provide companionship. They have also been able to detect oncoming epileptic seizures or the presence of certain cancers.
Dogs can also help to relieve stress and anxiety in people. Around 38% of U.S. households are estimated to have one or more dogs.
However, dogs of any age can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make people sick. Germs from dogs can cause a variety of illnesses, from minor skin infections to serious diseases.

How to stay healthy around dogs
Always supervise children while playing with dogs.
Make sure a dog is the right type of pet for your family before buying or adopting a dog or puppy. Talk to your veterinarian about the right type of dog for you. They can make sure the dog you choose fits your lifestyle and needs.
Wash your hands
Wash your hands with soap and running water:
After handling dogs, their food and water dishes, or their supplies
After contact with dog saliva or poop, even if you use a bag
After handling dog food, treats, toys, or bowls
Before you eat or drink
You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available.
Handwashing and children
Adults should always supervise hand washing for children under 5 years of age. Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations.
Safely clean up after your dog
Dog poop can carry germs that make people and animals sick.
Cleaning up after your dog and keeping the environment clean reduces the risk of diseases spreading to people and other animals.
Always pick up dog poop and dispose of it properly. Dog poop should be picked up, even in your own yard, and especially in areas where children may play.
Prevent dog scratches and bites
Dog bites can cause pain, injury, and spread germs that cause infection. Nearly 1 in 5 people bitten by a dog requires medical attention.
Any dog can bite especially when scared, nervous, eating, or when playing or protecting toys or puppies. Dogs may also bite when they aren't feeling well and want to be left alone.
There are many things you can do at home and within your community to help prevent dog scratches and bites. Practicing the safe handling tips below can help you avoid dog bites.
Know the risks
Children are more likely than adults to be bitten by a dog. The injuries from dog bites in children also tend to be more severe. Most dog bites affecting young children occur during everyday activities and while interacting with familiar dogs.
Having a dog in the household is linked to a higher likelihood of being bitten than not having a dog. As the number of dogs in the home increases, so does the likelihood of being bitten.
Adults with two or more dogs in the household are five times more likely to be bitten. This is comparison to people living without dogs at home. Among adults, men are more likely than women to be bitten by a dog.
How to prevent dog bites and scratches
Most dog bites are preventable.
Do not disturb a dog while it is eating, sleeping, or caring for puppies. Do not pet a dog if it appears to be hiding or seeing time alone. Do not continue petting a dog if it seems scared, sick, or angry.
If a dog knocks you over, curl into a ball. Tuck your head and place your hands over your ears and neck. You can also put a purse, bag, or jacket between you and the dog. Avoid doing the following actions to keep yourself safe:
Never encourage your dog to play aggressively or roughhouse.
Do not panic or make loud noises, and never run from a dog.
Avoid trying to break up dog fights.
Petting another owner's dog
Always ask if it is OK to pet someone else's dog before reaching out to pet it. This is important even if the dog appears friendly.
Let the new dog approach you first.
When a new dog approaches you, remain still to allow the dog to feel comfortable.
Always make sure a dog has seen you and sniffed you before you reach out to pet it.
Preventing dog bites in children
Do not let young children play with dogs without supervision, even if the child has met the dog previously. This includes your family pet dog.
Responsible pet ownership, including socializing your dog and using a leash in public, can help prevent dog bites.
Preventing bites from unfamiliar dogs
Do not approach an unfamiliar dog, even if it seems friendly or healthy. Call animal control if you see a dog in trouble or a dog running loose.
If an unfamiliar dog approaches you, stay still, be calm, and avoid direct eye contact with the dog. Say ""no"" or ""go home"" in a firm, deep voice and stand with the side of your body facing the dog. Slowly raise your hands to your neck with your elbows in. Wait for the dog to pass or slowly back away.
What to do if you are bitten or scratched by a dog
Germs can be spread from dog bites and scratches, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious.
For minor wounds
Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water.
Apply an antibiotic cream.
Cover the wound with a clean bandage.
For deep wounds
Apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth to stop the bleeding for deep wounds. Seek medical attention right away.
Call 911 or your local emergency medical services immediately if you cannot stop the bleeding or you feel faint or weak.
See if a healthcare provider if:
The wound is serious or deep.
The wound becomes infected.
You don't know if the dog has been vaccinated against rabies.
If it has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot.
The bite is deep.
Serious wounds are characterized by uncontrolled bleeding, extreme pain, and loss of function.
Infected wounds may be red, painful, or swollen, or cause a fever.
Let the healthcare provider know that you were bitten by a dog. The healthcare provider may consult with your state or local health department to help you decide if you need rabies treatment. This is known as rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).
Report the bite
Report dog bites
Report dog bites to your local animal control agency or police department.
Anyone who is bitten by a dog is at risk of getting rabies. Consider contacting your local animal control agency or police department to report the incident. This is especially important if you don't know if the dog has been vaccinated against rabies. It is also important to report the bite if the dog appears sick or is acting strangely.
If possible, contact the owner and ensure the animal has a current rabies vaccination. You will need the following information:
Rabies vaccine license number.
Name of the veterinarian who administered the vaccine.
The owner's name, address, and phone number.
How to keep dogs healthy
Keeping your dog healthy hepls keep you and your family healthy too.
Before choosing a dog
Do your research
Research and learn how to properly care for a dog before buying or adopting. Ask your veterinarian about the proper food, care, exercise, and environment that are best for the dog you are selecting.
Research any laws regarding ownership of certain breeds in your area before buying or adopting a dog.
How to choose a dog
Match a dog's attitude, temperament, size, and activity level with your family. Consider your home, and the amount of time you have to spend with your pet.
Choose a healthy dog
Pick a dog that is bright, alert, and playful. Dogs and puppies should have shiny, soft fur that is free of poop.
Signs of illness in a dog include appearing sluggish or depressed, having diarrhea. Abnormal breathing, and fluid running from its eyes or nose is also common in dogs with illnesses.
Make sure to take your new dog or puppy to the veterinarian within a few days to a week after adoption.
If your new dog becomes sick or dies
Take your dog to the veterinarian promptly If your dog becomes sick or dies soon after purchase or adoption. Make sure to tell your veterinarian if the pet was adopted internationally.
Inform the pet store, breeder, or rescue organization about the pet's illness or death.
Thoroughly clean the area your pet lived in.
How to house your dog
It is important to provide a safe, warm, and comfortable environment for your dog.
Housing your dog outside
If your dog will be housed outside, provide shelter such as a doghouse. This will protect your dog when it is cold or rainy and shade for when it is hot. Protecting your dog from the changes in weather will reduce stress and help keep it healthy.
Make sure your dog has access to fresh, clean water and food every day.
Consider fencing your yard
Consider fencing in your yard. A fence gives your dog room to play. It will also protect it from wild animals and reduce the risk of strangers interacting with your dog.
Don't tie up your dog outside
It is not recommended to keep dogs tied up outside. Tying dogs outside is illegal in some areas. In addition, dogs that are tied up are more likely to bite than those roaming freely in a fenced yard.
Keep your dog's environment clean
If your dog uses a kennel or doghouse, make sure to clean it regularly to prevent build-up of poop.
Feed your dog safely
Food safety rules apply to dog food and treats.
Do not feed dogs in areas where human food is prepared or eaten.
Always wash your hands after touching dog food or feeding your dog.
Store dog food separately from human food.
Do not feed your dog a raw diet. *
Talk to your veterinarian about the proper food for your dog.
*Germs like Salmonella and Listeria have been found in raw pet foods, even packaged foods sold in stores. These germs can make you and your pet sick.

About Pet Food Safety
Monitor your dog's health
Veterinarians can provide care recommendations for your dog.
Get routine check-ups with your dog's veterinarian
Take your dog to the veterinarian regularly to keep it healthy and prevent infectious diseases. Talk to your veterinarian about preventive treatments for fleas, ticks, heartworms, and other parasites.
Contact your veterinarian if you notice any signs of illness in your pet. Keep in mind that even a dog that looks healthy can spread germs to people and other animals.
Get your dog vaccinated
Keep your dog up to date on routine vaccinations like rabies. Vaccines can help protect your dog from dangerous diseases and help them live a longer life.
Tell your veterinarian about your dog's lifestyle, including whether it is often around other dogs or other animals. Ask about other vaccines you may need or want for your dog, like kennel cough.
Clean up househould messes immediately
Make sure to clean up any dog urine, poop, or vomit in the house immediately, and disinfect the area well. Use disposable gloves and make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.
Protect your dog from ticks
Talk to your veterinarian about the best tick prevention products for your dog and tickborne diseases in your area.

About Dirofilariasis
KEY POINTS
Dilofilariasis is an infection caused by parasitic roundworms.
In dogs, it is called heartworm infection.
Infection is spread by mosquito bites.
Overview
Dirofilaria are long, thin parasitic roundworms that infect a variety of mammals. Infection is transmitted by mosquito bites. There are many species of Dirofilaria, but human infection is caused most commonly by three species, D. immitis, D. repens, and D. tenuis. The main natural hosts for these three species are dogs and wild canids, such as foxes and wolves (D. immitis and D. repens) and raccoons (D. tenuis). D. immitis is also known as ""heartworm."" D. repens is not found in the United States, and D. tenuis appears to be restricted to raccoons in North America.
Dirofilariasis is the disease caused by Dirofilaria worm infections. In dogs, one form is called ""heartworm disease"" and is caused by D. immitis. D. immitis adult worms can cause pulmonary artery blockage in dogs, leading to an illness that can include cough, exhaustion upon exercise, fainting, coughing up blood, and severe weight loss.
Symptoms
Human infections with D. immitis can result in areas of inflammation induced by dying adult worms in pulmonary arteries that appear as coin lesions on chest x-rays. Coin lesions can also be caused by cancer and other serious diseases, and a coin lesion discovered accidentally on chest x-ray usually leads to an invasive procedure to learn the cause. Most human cases of pulmonary dirofilariasis are diagnosed from samples taken during these procedures. Most reported cases of D. immitis infection in humans have been in persons with no symptoms. People with symptoms can have cough (including coughing up blood), chest pain, fever, and pleural effusion (excess fluid between the tissues that line the lungs and the chest cavity). Rarely, D. immitis worms have been found in humans at outside the lungs, including the brain, eye, and testicle. When D. repens and D. tenuis infection is reported in humans, it is generally as the cause of nodules under the skin, but on occasion, worms are found in the conjunctiva.
Who is at risk
Dirofilariasis is found throughout the world where Dirofilaria species are common. In the United States, canine dirofilariasis has been reported from all states, and D. tenuis in raccoons is common in many areas where raccoons are found. Canine and human dirofilariasis are most prevalent in eastern and southeastern states, although rates are increasing rapidly in a number of western states. D. immitis is the Dirofilaria species most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis in humans in the United States. D. repens is the Dirofilaria species most commonly reported to cause dirofilariasis among humans in Europe. One or both of these species have been found to cause human dirofilariasis in other parts of the world.
How it spreads
The definitive mammalian hosts for Dirofilaria are primarily domestic dogs, wild canids (such as wolves and foxes), and raccoons. In these hosts, sexually mature worms produce microfilariae that circulate in the blood and are ingested by mosquitoes during a blood meal. In mosquitoes, the microfilariae develop into larvae that migrate to the proboscis (the long, tubular part of the mouth of the mosquito that punctures the skin during a blood meal), where they are ready to infect another host during a blood meal. Several types of mosquitoes are capable of transmitting Dirofilaria infection, including Aedes, Anopheles, and Mansonia.
Humans and a wide range of other mammals are accidental hosts that play no role in the transmission of Dirofilaria. In these hosts, Dirofilaria larvae can develop into adult worms but the worms remain sexually immature and no microfilariae are produced.

Prevention
Dirofilariasis can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites in areas where mosquitoes may be infected with Dirofilaria larvae. The risk of such mosquito bites can be reduced by leaving as little skin exposed as possible, by the use of insect repellent when exposed to mosquitoes, and by sleeping under an insecticide-treated bednet in areas where Dirofilaria-infected mosquitoes bite at night and have access to sleeping areas.
Diagnosis
In humans, dirofilariasis is diagnosed most frequently by the examination of tissue from areas of inflammation in the lung obtained as part of the diagnostic investigation of coin lesions (small, round abnormalities) on chest x-rays or from the examination of tissue in nodules under the skin. Blood tests are not yet helpful in the diagnosis of dirofilariasis in humans.
Treatment
The definitive treatment of Dirofilaria infection in humans is surgical removal of lung granulomas and nodules under the skin; this treatment is also curative. In many cases, no treatment with medicines is necessary.

Bringing a Dog into the U.S.
AT A GLANCE
If you are bringing a dog to the U.S., starting on August 1, 2024, there are new steps you need to take. These steps depend on where your dog has been in the past 6 months.
Background
CDC strives to protect America’s families, communities, and pets by preventing the reintroduction of dog rabies into the United States. Preventing infected dogs from entering the United States is a public health priority. CDC recommends all dogs be vaccinated against dog rabies.
Recent Changes
CDC values the feedback received from various countries, industry partners, and the public. CDC simplified the process for meeting requirements for dogs arriving from dog rabies-free or low-risk countries. This means that for dogs that have been only in dog rabies-free or low-risk countries for the last 6 months, the one form you will need is the CDC Dog Import Form, which should take a few minutes to complete.
Requirements are based on your dog's situation
What countries are high risk?
Review the list of high-risk countries for dog rabies. If your dog has been in any of these countries within the 6 months before arriving to the U.S., follow the requirements for dogs from high-risk countries.

WHAT TO KNOW
Dogs can sometimes carry germs that can make people and other animals sick.
Wash your hands after handling your dog, its food, waste, or supplies.
Provide routine veterinary care for your dog to keep it healthy and prevent the spread of diseases.
Always supervise young children around dogs, even trusted family pets.
Overview
Dogs can have many positive effects on the lives of their owners. They influence social, emotional, and cognitive development in children, promote an active lifestyle, and provide companionship. They have also been able to detect oncoming epileptic seizures or the presence of certain cancers.
Dogs can also help to relieve stress and anxiety in people. Around 38% of U.S. households are estimated to have one or more dogs.
However, dogs of any age can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make people sick. Germs from dogs can cause a variety of illnesses, from minor skin infections to serious diseases.

How to stay healthy around dogs
Always supervise children while playing with dogs.
Make sure a dog is the right type of pet for your family before buying or adopting a dog or puppy. Talk to your veterinarian about the right type of dog for you. They can make sure the dog you choose fits your lifestyle and needs.
Wash your hands
Wash your hands with soap and running water:
After handling dogs, their food and water dishes, or their supplies
After contact with dog saliva or poop, even if you use a bag
After handling dog food, treats, toys, or bowls
Before you eat or drink
You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available.
Handwashing and children
Adults should always supervise hand washing for children under 5 years of age. Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations.
Safely clean up after your dog
Dog poop can carry germs that make people and animals sick.
Cleaning up after your dog and keeping the environment clean reduces the risk of diseases spreading to people and other animals.
Always pick up dog poop and dispose of it properly. Dog poop should be picked up, even in your own yard, and especially in areas where children may play.
Prevent dog scratches and bites
Dog bites can cause pain, injury, and spread germs that cause infection. Nearly 1 in 5 people bitten by a dog requires medical attention.
Any dog can bite especially when scared, nervous, eating, or when playing or protecting toys or puppies. Dogs may also bite when they aren't feeling well and want to be left alone.
There are many things you can do at home and within your community to help prevent dog scratches and bites. Practicing the safe handling tips below can help you avoid dog bites.
Know the risks
Children are more likely than adults to be bitten by a dog. The injuries from dog bites in children also tend to be more severe. Most dog bites affecting young children occur during everyday activities and while interacting with familiar dogs.
Having a dog in the household is linked to a higher likelihood of being bitten than not having a dog. As the number of dogs in the home increases, so does the likelihood of being bitten.
Adults with two or more dogs in the household are five times more likely to be bitten. This is comparison to people living without dogs at home. Among adults, men are more likely than women to be bitten by a dog.
How to prevent dog bites and scratches
Most dog bites are preventable.
Do not disturb a dog while it is eating, sleeping, or caring for puppies. Do not pet a dog if it appears to be hiding or seeing time alone. Do not continue petting a dog if it seems scared, sick, or angry.
If a dog knocks you over, curl into a ball. Tuck your head and place your hands over your ears and neck. You can also put a purse, bag, or jacket between you and the dog. Avoid doing the following actions to keep yourself safe:
Never encourage your dog to play aggressively or roughhouse.
Do not panic or make loud noises, and never run from a dog.
Avoid trying to break up dog fights.
Petting another owner's dog
Always ask if it is OK to pet someone else's dog before reaching out to pet it. This is important even if the dog appears friendly.
Let the new dog approach you first.
When a new dog approaches you, remain still to allow the dog to feel comfortable.
Always make sure a dog has seen you and sniffed you before you reach out to pet it.
Preventing dog bites in children
Do not let young children play with dogs without supervision, even if the child has met the dog previously. This includes your family pet dog.
Responsible pet ownership, including socializing your dog and using a leash in public, can help prevent dog bites.
Preventing bites from unfamiliar dogs
Do not approach an unfamiliar dog, even if it seems friendly or healthy. Call animal control if you see a dog in trouble or a dog running loose.
If an unfamiliar dog approaches you, stay still, be calm, and avoid direct eye contact with the dog. Say ""no"" or ""go home"" in a firm, deep voice and stand with the side of your body facing the dog. Slowly raise your hands to your neck with your elbows in. Wait for the dog to pass or slowly back away.
What to do if you are bitten or scratched by a dog
Germs can be spread from dog bites and scratches, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious.
For minor wounds
Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water.
Apply an antibiotic cream.
Cover the wound with a clean bandage.
For deep wounds
Apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth to stop the bleeding for deep wounds. Seek medical attention right away.
Call 911 or your local emergency medical services immediately if you cannot stop the bleeding or you feel faint or weak.
See if a healthcare provider if:
The wound is serious or deep.
The wound becomes infected.
You don't know if the dog has been vaccinated against rabies.
If it has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot.
The bite is deep.
Serious wounds are characterized by uncontrolled bleeding, extreme pain, and loss of function.
Infected wounds may be red, painful, or swollen, or cause a fever.
Let the healthcare provider know that you were bitten by a dog. The healthcare provider may consult with your state or local health department to help you decide if you need rabies treatment. This is known as rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).
Report the bite
Report dog bites
Report dog bites to your local animal control agency or police department.
Anyone who is bitten by a dog is at risk of getting rabies. Consider contacting your local animal control agency or police department to report the incident. This is especially important if you don't know if the dog has been vaccinated against rabies. It is also important to report the bite if the dog appears sick or is acting strangely.
If possible, contact the owner and ensure the animal has a current rabies vaccination. You will need the following information:
Rabies vaccine license number.
Name of the veterinarian who administered the vaccine.
The owner's name, address, and phone number.
How to keep dogs healthy
Keeping your dog healthy hepls keep you and your family healthy too.
Before choosing a dog
Do your research
Research and learn how to properly care for a dog before buying or adopting. Ask your veterinarian about the proper food, care, exercise, and environment that are best for the dog you are selecting.
Research any laws regarding ownership of certain breeds in your area before buying or adopting a dog.
How to choose a dog
Match a dog's attitude, temperament, size, and activity level with your family. Consider your home, and the amount of time you have to spend with your pet.
Choose a healthy dog
Pick a dog that is bright, alert, and playful. Dogs and puppies should have shiny, soft fur that is free of poop.
Signs of illness in a dog include appearing sluggish or depressed, having diarrhea. Abnormal breathing, and fluid running from its eyes or nose is also common in dogs with illnesses.
Make sure to take your new dog or puppy to the veterinarian within a few days to a week after adoption.
If your new dog becomes sick or dies
Take your dog to the veterinarian promptly If your dog becomes sick or dies soon after purchase or adoption. Make sure to tell your veterinarian if the pet was adopted internationally.
Inform the pet store, breeder, or rescue organization about the pet's illness or death.
Thoroughly clean the area your pet lived in.
How to house your dog
It is important to provide a safe, warm, and comfortable environment for your dog.
Housing your dog outside
If your dog will be housed outside, provide shelter such as a doghouse. This will protect your dog when it is cold or rainy and shade for when it is hot. Protecting your dog from the changes in weather will reduce stress and help keep it healthy.
Make sure your dog has access to fresh, clean water and food every day.
Consider fencing your yard
Consider fencing in your yard. A fence gives your dog room to play. It will also protect it from wild animals and reduce the risk of strangers interacting with your dog.
Don't tie up your dog outside
It is not recommended to keep dogs tied up outside. Tying dogs outside is illegal in some areas. In addition, dogs that are tied up are more likely to bite than those roaming freely in a fenced yard.
Keep your dog's environment clean
If your dog uses a kennel or doghouse, make sure to clean it regularly to prevent build-up of poop.
Feed your dog safely
Food safety rules apply to dog food and treats.
Do not feed dogs in areas where human food is prepared or eaten.
Always wash your hands after touching dog food or feeding your dog.
Store dog food separately from human food.
Do not feed your dog a raw diet. *
Talk to your veterinarian about the proper food for your dog.
*Germs like Salmonella and Listeria have been found in raw pet foods, even packaged foods sold in stores. These germs can make you and your pet sick.

Monitor your dog's health
Veterinarians can provide care recommendations for your dog.
Get routine check-ups with your dog's veterinarian
Take your dog to the veterinarian regularly to keep it healthy and prevent infectious diseases. Talk to your veterinarian about preventive treatments for fleas, ticks, heartworms, and other parasites.
Contact your veterinarian if you notice any signs of illness in your pet. Keep in mind that even a dog that looks healthy can spread germs to people and other animals.
Get your dog vaccinated
Keep your dog up to date on routine vaccinations like rabies. Vaccines can help protect your dog from dangerous diseases and help them live a longer life.
Tell your veterinarian about your dog's lifestyle, including whether it is often around other dogs or other animals. Ask about other vaccines you may need or want for your dog, like kennel cough.
Clean up househould messes immediately
Make sure to clean up any dog urine, poop, or vomit in the house immediately, and disinfect the area well. Use disposable gloves and make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.
Protect your dog from ticks
Talk to your veterinarian about the best tick prevention products for your dog and tickborne diseases in your area.

Intimate Partner Violence Prevention
EXPLORE TOPICS

MAY 16, 2024
About Intimate Partner Violence
KEY POINTS
Intimate partner violence is a significant public health issue.
Intimate partner violence has a profound impact on lifelong health, opportunity, and well-being.
What is intimate partner violence?
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is abuse or aggression that occurs in a romantic relationship. Intimate partner refers to both current and former spouses and dating partners.
IPV can vary in how often it happens and how severe it is. It can range from one episode of violence to chronic and severe episodes over multiple years.
IPV can include any of the following types of behavior:
Physical violence is when a person hurts or tries to hurt a partner by using physical force.
Sexual violence is forcing or attempting to force a partner to take part in a sex act, sexual touching, or a non-physical sexual event (e.g., sexting) when the partner does not or cannot consent.
Stalking is a pattern of repeated, unwanted attention and contact by a partner that causes fear or concern for one's own safety or the safety of someone close to the victim.
Psychological aggression is the use of verbal and non-verbal communication with the intent to harm a partner mentally or emotionally or to exert control over a partner.
Quick facts and stats
IPV is common. It affects millions of people in the United States each year. Data from CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) indicate:1
About 41% of women and 26% of men experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime and reported a related impact.A
Over 61 million women and 53 million men have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
IPV starts early and continues throughout people's lives. When IPV occurs in adolescence, it is called teen dating violence. About 16 million women and 11 million men who reported experiencing intimate partner violence in their lifetime said that they first experienced it before age 18.1
While violence impacts all people, some individuals and communities experience inequities in risk for violence due to the social and structural conditions in which they live, work, and play. Youth from groups that have been marginalized are at greater risk of experiencing sexual and physical dating violence.2
Outcomes
Intimate partner violence can result in injuries and even death. Data from U.S. crime reports suggest that about one in five homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner. The reports also found that over half of female homicide victims are killed by a current or former male intimate partner.3
Many other negative health outcomes are associated with intimate partner violence. These include conditions affecting the heart, muscles and bones, and digestive, reproductive, and nervous systems, many of which are chronic.3
Survivors can experience mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. They are at higher risk for engaging in behaviors such as smoking, binge drinking, and risky sexual activity. People from groups that have been marginalized, such as people from racial and ethnic minority groups, are at higher risk for worse consequences.4
Although the personal consequences of intimate partner violence are devastating, there are also many costs to society. The lifetime economic cost associated with medical services for IPV-related injuries, lost productivity from paid work, criminal justice and other costs, is $3.6 trillion. The cost of IPV over a victim’s lifetime was $103,767 for women and $23,414 for men.5
Prevention
Intimate partner violence can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing intimate partner violence.
Preventing intimate partner violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence.
Promoting healthy, respectful, and nonviolent relationships and communities can help reduce the occurrence of intimate partner violence. It also can prevent the harmful and long-lasting effects of intimate partner violence on individuals, families, and communities.

Living with Down Syndrome
KEY POINTS
Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition diagnosed in the United States.
Families and healthcare providers in the United States have learned over time how to improve care for people living with Down syndrome.
Children with Down syndrome are living longer, many into their adult years.
Ongoing, appropriate medical care can help children and adults with Down syndrome live as healthy lives as possible.
Down syndrome in the United States
Each year, about 5,700 babies born in the United States have Down syndrome. This means that Down syndrome occurs in about 1 in every 640 babies.
Life expectancy
The life expectancy of people with Down syndrome increased dramatically between 1960 and 2007.1 In 1960, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 10 years old. In 2007, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 47 years old.
Many factors can affect how long a person with Down syndrome lives. Babies born with a very low birth weight or a congenital heart defect are less likely to survive their first year.23 There are also racial disparities, with Black infants having a lower survival past the first year. More research is needed to help understand why.
Other health conditions
Between 50 and 65% of all babies born with Down syndrome are also born with a congenital heart defect.24 Babies with Down syndrome can be affected by a wide variety of heart defects. Many of these conditions will need surgery, while some milder conditions might go away on their own as the child grows.
Compared with children without Down syndrome, children with Down syndrome are at higher risk for certain other medical conditions.5 Some of the most common conditions include:
Hearing loss (up to 75% may be affected)
Obstructive sleep apnea, where a person's breathing temporarily stops while asleep (between 50 and 75%)
Ear infections (between 50 and 70% may be affected)
Eye diseases, like cataracts (up to 60%)
Eye issues requiring glasses (50%)
Heart defects present at birth (between 50 and 65%)
Alzheimer's disease

Guinea Worm Disease
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
PARASITES 
MARCH 14, 2024
About Guinea Worm
KEY POINTS
Guinea worm disease (GWD) is caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis.
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
The disease affects communities in remote parts of Africa that do not have safe water to drink.
There is no treatment nor a vaccine for Guinea worm disease.
Overview
Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease (GWD), is an infection caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. GWD is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) transmitted to people mostly by consuming unsafe water. Unfiltered drinking water from ponds or other stagnant surface water sources can contain near-microscopic crustaceans called copepods (tiny ""water fleas"") that are infected with Guinea worm larvae (immature forms of the Guinea worm).
Signs and symptoms
People do not usually have GWD symptoms until about one year after infection. Then, a mature pregnant female worm full of larvae creates a blister on the skin through which she will emerge and expel her larvae when she comes in contact with water. A few days to hours before the worm, which can measure up to 3 feet (1 meter) in length, comes out of the skin, a person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area. Most worms come out of people's legs and feet, though worms can come out of other body parts, too.
Challenges
People in remote rural communities who have GWD often lack access to healthcare. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very painful, disabling, and take a long time to remove. The emerging worm can cause a wound that may develop a secondary infection.
People at risk
Anyone who consumes drinking water from a pond or other stagnant water source contaminated with infected copepods is at risk for infection. People's risk for disease can vary. People do not get immunity after GWD, which means they can get it again.
GWD transmission also has a seasonal pattern.
How it spreads
Water contact triggers the Guinea worm to release a milky white liquid that contains hundreds of thousands of immature larvae into the water. In ponds and other stagnant water sources, these larvae are then consumed by copepods. People might become infected with Guinea worms by consuming unfiltered drinking water from such water sources containing infected copepods. People and animals might also become infected by eating certain aquatic animals (e.g., fish or frogs) that have swallowed infected copepods. People and animals infected with GWD can then spread the disease when the worm matures and is ready to emerge from the body if they enter ponds and other stagnant water sources that others drink from.
Prevention
Guinea worm is a disease that has been prioritized for eradication by the World Health Organization. There were an estimated 3.5 million Guinea worm cases occurring annually in 20 African and Asian countries in 1986, but today, through the Guinea Worm Eradication Program
(GWEP), only a handful of countries continue to have the disease. GWEP
undertakes several water-related and other measures to prevent GWD:
Surveillance and case containment
Safe water practices, including distribution of cloth and pipe filters to remove copepods, and advocacy for installation or rehabilitation of safe drinking water supplies like borehole wells
Vector control

There were 14 human GWD cases reported in 2023 in Chad, South Sudan, Mali, Cameroon, and Central African Republic.
There were 714 animal GWD infections reported in 2023, which is a slight increase compared to 2022 following expanded surveillance activities.
WHO has certified 200 countries free from Guinea worm. The six countries that have not yet been certified as free from Guinea worm are Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, South Sudan, and Sudan.
Treatment and recovery
There is no drug to treat Guinea worm infection. Once part of the worm begins to come out of the wound, it is important that all of the worm is removed to prevent complications. Anti-inflammatory medicine can help reduce pain and swelling, and antibiotic ointment can help prevent infections.
Vaccines
There is no vaccine to prevent Guinea worm infection.

About Guinea Worm
KEY POINTS
Guinea worm disease (GWD) is caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis.
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
The disease affects communities in remote parts of Africa that do not have safe water to drink.
There is no treatment nor a vaccine for Guinea worm disease.
Overview
Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease (GWD), is an infection caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. GWD is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) transmitted to people mostly by consuming unsafe water. Unfiltered drinking water from ponds or other stagnant surface water sources can contain near-microscopic crustaceans called copepods (tiny ""water fleas"") that are infected with Guinea worm larvae (immature forms of the Guinea worm).
Signs and symptoms
People do not usually have GWD symptoms until about one year after infection. Then, a mature pregnant female worm full of larvae creates a blister on the skin through which she will emerge and expel her larvae when she comes in contact with water. A few days to hours before the worm, which can measure up to 3 feet (1 meter) in length, comes out of the skin, a person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area. Most worms come out of people's legs and feet, though worms can come out of other body parts, too.
Challenges
People in remote rural communities who have GWD often lack access to healthcare. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very painful, disabling, and take a long time to remove. The emerging worm can cause a wound that may develop a secondary infection.
People at risk
Anyone who consumes drinking water from a pond or other stagnant water source contaminated with infected copepods is at risk for infection. People's risk for disease can vary. People do not get immunity after GWD, which means they can get it again.
GWD transmission also has a seasonal pattern.
How it spreads
Water contact triggers the Guinea worm to release a milky white liquid that contains hundreds of thousands of immature larvae into the water. In ponds and other stagnant water sources, these larvae are then consumed by copepods. People might become infected with Guinea worms by consuming unfiltered drinking water from such water sources containing infected copepods. People and animals might also become infected by eating certain aquatic animals (e.g., fish or frogs) that have swallowed infected copepods. People and animals infected with GWD can then spread the disease when the worm matures and is ready to emerge from the body if they enter ponds and other stagnant water sources that others drink from.
Prevention
Guinea worm is a disease that has been prioritized for eradication by the World Health Organization. There were an estimated 3.5 million Guinea worm cases occurring annually in 20 African and Asian countries in 1986, but today, through the Guinea Worm Eradication Program
(GWEP), only a handful of countries continue to have the disease. GWEP
undertakes several water-related and other measures to prevent GWD:
Surveillance and case containment
Safe water practices, including distribution of cloth and pipe filters to remove copepods, and advocacy for installation or rehabilitation of safe drinking water supplies like borehole wells
Vector control
Health education and community mobilization
Quick facts
There were 14 human GWD cases reported in 2023 in Chad, South Sudan, Mali, Cameroon, and Central African Republic.
There were 714 animal GWD infections reported in 2023, which is a slight increase compared to 2022 following expanded surveillance activities.
WHO has certified 200 countries free from Guinea worm. The six countries that have not yet been certified as free from Guinea worm are Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, South Sudan, and Sudan.
Treatment and recovery
There is no drug to treat Guinea worm infection. Once part of the worm begins to come out of the wound, it is important that all of the worm is removed to prevent complications. Anti-inflammatory medicine can help reduce pain and swelling, and antibiotic ointment can help prevent infections.

Impaired Driving
EXPLORE TOPICS

MAY 16, 2024
Impaired Driving
KEY POINTS
Impaired driving happens when someone operates a vehicle while impaired by substances such as marijuana, illicit drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and/or alcohol.
Driving while impaired by any substance is dangerous and illegal.
There are effective measures that can help prevent injuries and deaths from impaired driving.
Effects of substances on driving
Safe driving requires focus, coordination, good judgment, and quick reactions to the environment. Any alcohol or other drug
use impairs the ability to drive safely.
The amount of alcohol in a person's system can be measured. This measurement is called blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Most states have set the legal BAC limit for driving at 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter (g/dL); the limit is 0.05 g/dL in Utah.1 However, impairment starts at lower BAC levels. Information on the effects of alcohol on driving at a range of BACs is available here
.
We know a lot about alcohol's effects on driving, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact of drugs on driving skills.2 However, research has shown that both legal and illicit drugs impair the skills needed to drive safely. For example:
Some of the effects of being impaired by marijuana that can affect driving include slowed reaction time and decision making, impaired coordination, and distorted perception.2345
Other drugs (such as cocaine or illicit amphetamines) can also impair skills like perception, memory, and attention in the short or long term.2
Prescription and over-the-counter medications can cause many side effects that can impact driving, such as sleepiness, impaired vision, and impaired coordination.6
Use of multiple substances (such as marijuana and alcohol) at the same time can increase impairment.57
Impacts
In 2020, 11,654 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol-impaired drivers, accounting for 30% of all traffic-related deaths in the United States.8
32 people in the United States are killed every day in crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver — this is one death every 45 minutes.8
It is not known how many people are killed each year in crashes involving drug-impaired drivers because of data limitations.9 Regardless, driving while impaired by any substance is dangerous and illegal.
Keep Reading: Impaired Driving Facts
People at increased risk
Some groups are more at risk for impaired driving and related crashes and deaths. These include teen drivers and passengers,10 young adult drivers, men, and drivers who don't always wear a seat belt.8
Keep Reading: People at Increased Risk for Impaired Driving
What the research shows
There are multiple effective measures that states and communities can take to prevent alcohol-impaired driving. These include actively implementing and enforcing lower BAC limits11 and implementing sobriety checkpoints.12
Keep Reading: Preventing Impaired Driving
What you can do
For drivers: Plan ahead. If you plan to drink alcohol or use drugs, make plans so that you do not have to drive.
For everyone: Don't let your friends drive while impaired by alcohol and/or drugs. If you're hosting a party where alcohol or drugs will be available, remind your guests to plan ahead.

Drought and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Drought is a prolonged period of dry weather caused by lack of rainfall, resulting in water shortage.
Periods of drought can result in inadequate water supply and can lead to public health problems.
Take action and learn how drought can impact your health and the health of your family.
Overview
Droughts can last from a single season to many decades and can affect from a few hundred to millions of square miles. With our changing climate, historically dry areas of the United States are likely to experience an increased risk of drought.
Drought can affect areas or communities differently depending on several additional variables, including:
the structure and capacity of existing water systems,
local governance of water use,
urban vs. rural land use,
economic development,
the at-risk populations living in the affected area, and
other societal factors, such as the presence of local community networks.
Health impacts
Severe drought conditions can negatively affect air quality. During drought, there is an increased risk for wildfires and dust storms. Particulate matter suspended in the air from these events can irritate the bronchial passages and lungs. Chronic respiratory illnesses can become worse, and the risk for respiratory infections like bronchitis and pneumonia can increase.
The health impacts of drought are numerous and far reaching. Some drought-related health effects are experienced in the short-term and can be directly observed and measured. However, the slow rise or chronic nature of drought can result in longer term, indirect health impacts that are not always easy to anticipate or monitor.
The possible public health impacts of drought include:
compromised quantity and quality of drinking water;
increased recreational risks;
effects on air quality;
diminished living conditions related to energy, air quality, and sanitation and hygiene;
mental health effects related to economic and job losses;
compromised food and nutrition; and
increased incidence of illness and disease.
For more information on drought, see our infographic, which offers an overview on these three main questions: Why does drought matter? How can drought affect health? What is CDC doing?

Infectious Diseases in Persons Who Inject Drugs
KEY POINTS
A deadly consequence of the opioid crisis is increased blood-borne infections, including viral hepatitis, HIV, and bacterial and fungal infections.
Infections are spread through contaminated injection drug equipment, unsanitary conditions and low vaccination rates among at-risk populations.
What CDC is doing
A man deposits used syringes into a red disposal container.
CDC's infectious disease programs work to implement evidence-based prevention programs in school and community settings, and to stop the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV among people who inject drugs. Access to comprehensive prevention services is essential for all persons who inject drugs.
Syringe services programs (SSPs) are community-based prevention programs that can provide a range of services, including access to and disposal of sterile syringes and injection equipment, vaccination, testing, and linkage to infectious disease care and substance use treatment. Nearly 30 years of research shows that comprehensive syringe services programs (SSPs) are safe, effective, and cost-saving, do not increase illegal drug use or crime, and play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections. Below are a summary of CDC resources on infectious disease and injection drug use.

DECEMBER 21, 2023
ESPAÑOL
About Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Disease
KEY POINTS
Some TB germs are resistant to medicines used to treat TB disease. This means the medicine can no longer kill the TB germs.
Drug-resistant TB disease is difficult and costly to treat.
The most important way to prevent drug-resistant TB disease is for all people being treated for TB disease to take all TB medicine exactly as prescribed.
Drug-resistant TB disease should be treated by a TB medical expert.
Overview
Some TB germs are resistant to medicines used to treat TB disease. This means that the medicine can no longer kill the TB germs.
Drug-resistant TB disease means that the TB germs are resistant to at least one of the most effective TB medicines.
Types
There are different types of drug-resistant TB disease, depending on what medicines the TB germs are resistant to.
Multidrug-resistant TB disease (MDR TB) is caused by germs that are resistant to two or more of the main TB medicines: isoniazid and rifampin.
Two more serious forms of MDR TB are called pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB). Pre-XDR and XDR TB are rare types of TB disease that are resistant to nearly all medicines used to treat TB disease.
People at risk
Drug-resistant TB disease is more common in people who:
Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease.
Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB disease is common.
Develop TB disease again, after being treated for TB disease in the past.
Do not take all of their TB medicines.
Do not take their TB medicines regularly.
Causes
Exposure to drug-resistant TB germs
Some people develop drug-resistant TB disease because they are exposed to drug-resistant TB germs. Drug-resistant TB germs are spread the same way that drug-susceptible TB germs are spread.
TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The TB germs are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings.
These germs can stay in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. TB germs are more likely to spread in indoor areas or other places with poor air circulation (such as a closed vehicle) than in outdoor areas.
People who have spent time with someone who is sick with drug-resistant TB disease can become infected with these resistant TB germs.
Keep Reading:
How Tuberculosis Spreads
Drug-resistant TB disease can occur when the medicines used to treat TB are misused or mismanaged.
Examples of misuse or mismanagement include:
People do not complete a full course of treatment for TB disease.
Health care providers prescribe the wrong treatment for TB disease (the wrong dose or length of time).
Medicines for proper treatment of TB disease are not available.
TB medicines are poor quality.
Prevention
You can help prevent drug-resistant TB disease.
Take all TB medicines exactly as prescribed by your health care provider.
Do not miss any doses and do not stop treatment early. Tell your health care provider if you are having trouble taking the medicines, for example, if your medicine makes you throw up, you get a fever, or develop a rash.
Diagnosis
Part of a medical evaluation for TB disease includes laboratory tests to find TB germs. If these tests find TB germs, laboratories perform additional tests to see if the germs are resistant to any of the TB medicines.
Keep Reading:
Diagnosing Tuberculosis
Treatment
Treating and curing drug-resistant TB disease is complicated.
People with drug-resistant TB disease must be treated with special medicines. Treatment may take a long time, sometimes months or years and the medicines can cause side effects.
People with multidrug-resistant TB disease or extensively drug-resistant TB disease are at greater risk of severe illness and dying from the disease.
People with drug-resistant TB disease must see a TB expert who can make sure they prescribe the best medicines to treat their drug-resistant TB disease and closely observe their treatment to make sure it is working.

Hymenolepiasis
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
PARASITES 
JULY 11, 2024
About Hymenolepiasis (Dwarf Tapeworm)
KEY POINTS
Hymenolepiasis is caused by a parasitic tapeworm, also known as the ""dwarf tapeworm.""
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
People can get dwarf tapeworm by consuming food or water contaminated by dwarf tapeworm eggs.
Dwarf tapeworm occurs worldwide, most often in people living in areas with poor sanitation and people living in institutional settings.
Overview
Dwarf tapeworm (i.e., Hymenolepis nana) is a type of parasitic tapeworm. The infection occurs worldwide.
Adult dwarf tapeworms are very small compared to other tapeworms. They can be anywhere from 15 – 40 mm (up to 2 in.) in length. The adult dwarf tapeworm consists of many small parts called ""proglottids."" When the dwarf tapeworm matures in the intestine, these proglottids break off and people pass them in their stool (poop).
Adult dwarf tapeworms can live for 4 – 6 weeks.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Hymenolepiasis (Dwarf Tapeworm) page.
Signs and symptoms
Most people infected with dwarf tapeworm do not have symptoms. When people do have symptoms, they can include one or more of the following:
Nausea
Weakness
Loss of appetite
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Children, especially those with heavy infections (a high number of tapeworms) can have the following symptoms:
Headache
Itchy bottom
Difficulty sleeping
At-risk populations
Dwarf tapeworm infections can occur worldwide. Infection is common among children, as well as people living in institutional settings, and those living in areas with unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact).
How it spreads
People can get dwarf tapeworm infection when they accidentally consume dwarf tapeworm eggs. This can happen when people consume fecal (poop) contaminated food or water, often when people touch their mouths with unclean hands or eating something with contaminated soil. People can also become infected if they accidentally consume an infected insect (an intermediate host, such as a small beetle or mealworm) that can contaminate food you eat.
People can spread the infection to others. Dwarf tapeworm eggs are infectious, which means they can re-infect you or infect others immediately after they are shed in feces (poop).
Prevention
To avoid getting dwarf tapeworm infection, people should take the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before preparing foods.
Teach children the importance of handwashing to prevent infection.
When traveling to countries where there is a higher risk of food contamination, wash, peel, or cook all raw vegetables and fruits with safe water (sanitized water, such as bottled, boiled, or filtered water) before eating.
See more on Handwashing.
Diagnosis
If you think you have dwarf tapeworm infection, see a healthcare provider.
Treatment and recovery
If diagnosed with dwarf tapeworm infection, a healthcare provider will treat you with praziquantel (the treatment of choice) or niclosamide or nitazoxanide (alternative drugs). These medications will cause the dwarf tapeworm to dissolve (break down) in the intestine. Depending on the infection, a person might have to have more than one treatment.
Niclosamide is not available in the US.
Myths and misconceptions
A dwarf tapeworm does not cause weight loss. You cannot feel the dwarf tapeworm inside your body.
