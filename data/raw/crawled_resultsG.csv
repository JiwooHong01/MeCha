HPV Vaccination
KEY POINTS
Protect your child from certain cancers later in life with HPV vaccine.
CDC recommends 2 doses of HPV vaccine at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccination can be started at age 9 years.
Introduction
HPV vaccination provides safe, effective, and lasting protection against the HPV infections that most commonly cause cancer. The HPV vaccine series is most effective when given before a person is exposed to the virus.
Every year in the United States, HPV causes about 36,000 cases of cancer in both men and women.

Reasons to Get Vaccinated
Available vaccines
There are several types of HPV vaccines. That's why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later. It protects your child long before they ever have contact with the virus.
Gardasil-9
Gardasil-9 (9vHPV) is the vaccine distributed in the United States. This vaccine protects against nine HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).
Other vaccine types
In the past, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil, 4vHPV) and bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix, 2vHPV) were licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
All of the HPV vaccines protect against HPV types 16 and 18 that cause most HPV cancers.
Recommendations
Children ages 11–12 years should get 2 doses of HPV vaccine, given 6 to 12 months apart. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9. Only 2 doses are needed if the first dose was given before 15th birthday.
1st dose
11–12 years old (can start at age 9)
2nd dose
6–12 months after the 1st dose
Children 9–14 years old who have received 2 doses of HPV vaccine less than 5 months apart will need a third dose.
People 15–26 years old who start the series later need 3 doses of HPV vaccine.
The doses are given over 6 months.
If your teen isn't vaccinated yet, talk to their doctor about doing so as soon as possible.
People with weakened immune systems should get 3 doses if they are 9–26 years old.
People older than 26 years. Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years.
Some adults age 27 through 45 years who are not already vaccinated may decide to get HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination for them.
HPV vaccination in this age range provides less benefit, because more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV.
Why getting vaccinated is important
HPV is a very common virus that can cause cancers later in life. About 13 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year. You can protect your child from these cancers with HPV vaccine.
Who should get vaccinated
HPV vaccination is recommended at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9 years. All preteens need HPV vaccination, so they are protected from HPV infections that can cause cancer later in life.
Teens and young adults through age 26 years who didn't start or finish the HPV vaccine series also need HPV vaccination.
Who shouldn't get vaccinated
Tell your doctor about any severe allergies. Some people should not get some HPV vaccines if they:
Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of an HPV vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV vaccine.
Have an allergy to yeast (Gardasil and Gardasil 9).
Are pregnant.
HPV vaccines are safe for children who are mildly ill. This includes those with a low-grade fever of less than 101 degrees, a cold, runny nose, or cough. People with a moderate or severe illness should wait until they are better.
The vaccine is safe and effective
HPV vaccination works extremely well. HPV vaccine has the potential to prevent more than 90% of cancers caused by HPV.
Fewer teens and young adults are getting genital warts.
HPV vaccination has also reduced the number of cases of pre-cancers of the cervix in young women.
The protection provided by HPV vaccines lasts a long time. People who received HPV vaccines were followed for at least about 12 years, and their protection against HPV has remained high with no evidence of decreasing over time.
HPV infections and cervical pre-cancers (abnormal cells on the cervix that can lead to cancer) have dropped since 2006, when HPV vaccines were first used in the United States.
Among teen girls, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 88%.
Among young adult women, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 81%.
Among vaccinated women, the percentage of cervical pre-cancers caused by the HPV types most often linked to cervical cancer has dropped by 40%.
Keep in mind
That's why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later. It protects your child long before they ever have contact with the virus.
Possible side effects
Many people who get HPV vaccine have no side effects at all. Some people report having very mild side effects, like a sore arm from the shot.
The most common side effects of HPV vaccine are usually mild and include:
Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given
Fever
Dizziness or fainting (fainting after any vaccine, including HPV vaccine, is more common among adolescents than others)
Headache or feeling tired
Nausea
Muscle or joint pain
To prevent fainting and injuries from fainting, teens should be seated or lying down during vaccination; they should also do the same for 15 minutes after getting the shot.
Finding and paying for the vaccine
Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. If your doctor does not stock HPV vaccine, ask for a referral. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, or schools. You can contact your state health department to learn more about where to get HPV vaccine in your community.

Where to Find Vaccines
Vaccine costs
There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines:
Health insurance
Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children Program
Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines.

Genetic Counseling
KEY POINTS
Genetic counseling can help you and your family make informed decisions about genetic testing.
What it is
Genetic counseling gives you information about how genetic conditions might affect you or your family. The genetic counselor or other healthcare professional will collect your personal and family health history. They can use this information to determine how likely it is that you or your family member has a genetic condition. Based on this information, the genetic counselor can help you decide whether a genetic test might be right for you.
Reasons for genetic counseling
Based on your personal and family health history, your healthcare provider might refer you for genetic counseling. Genetic counselors may focus on a particular area of genetic counseling, such as prenatal, pediatric, or cancer, or they may work in one or more specialty fields, such as cardiovascular health or psychiatry.
There are different stages in your life when you might be referred for genetic counseling.
Planning for pregnancy
Genetic counseling before you become pregnant can address concerns about factors that might affect your baby during infancy or childhood, or your ability to become pregnant, including
Genetic conditions that run in your family or your partner's family
History of infertility, multiple miscarriages, or stillbirth
Previous pregnancy or child affected by a birth defect or genetic condition
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) options
During pregnancy
Genetic counseling while you are pregnant can address certain tests that may be done during your pregnancy, any detected problems, or conditions that might affect your baby during infancy or childhood, including
History of infertility, multiple miscarriages, or stillbirth
Previous pregnancy or child affected by a birth defect or genetic condition
Abnormal test results, such as a blood test, ultrasound, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), or amniocentesis
Maternal infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), and other exposures such as medicines, drugs, chemicals, and x-rays
Genetic screening that is recommended for all pregnant women, which includes cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and any conditions that run in your family or your partner's family
Childhood
Genetic counseling can address concerns if your child is showing signs and symptoms of a disorder that might be genetic, including
Disorders identified through newborn screening
Birth defects
Autism spectrum disorder or other developmental disabilities
Vision or hearing problems
Adulthood
Genetic counseling can be helpful if you have symptoms of a condition or have a family history of a condition that makes you more likely to be affected with that condition, including
Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome
Lynch syndrome (hereditary colorectal and other cancers)
Familial hypercholesterolemia
Muscular dystrophy and other muscle diseases
Inherited movement disorders such as Huntington's disease
Inherited blood disorders such as sickle cell disease
Find a genetics specialist
There are various ways to access genetic counseling services, including in person, by phone, and by video conference.
Find a genetic counselor
using the National Society of Genetic Counselors directory.
Find a genetics clinic
using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics directory.
Next steps
Following your genetic counseling session, you might decide to have genetic testing. Genetic counseling after testing can help you better understand your test results and treatment options, help you deal with emotional concerns, and refer you to other healthcare providers and advocacy and support groups.

Genetic Disorders
WHAT TO KNOW
Genetic disorders are health problems that happen because of some type of abnormality in a person's genetic material. There are several types of genetic disorders. Some disorders are caused by a genetic change (mutation) in a single gene; some are caused by an abnormality in one of the chromosomes; and some are complex, involving numerous genes and influences from environmental factors.
Overview
Genetic disorders are health problems that happen because of some type of abnormality in a person's genetic material. There are several types of genetic disorders. In some cases, a genetic change in a single gene can cause someone to have a disease or condition. In other cases, the gene does not have a genetic change, but a person has more or fewer copies of the gene than most people, and this causes a disease or condition. Some diseases or conditions occur when a person does not have the same number of chromosomes as most people or has part of a chromosome that is missing, extra, or not in the right place.
Most genetic disorders happen due to the combination of many genetic changes acting together with a person's behaviors and environment. These are sometimes called complex conditions.
A detailed description of the basic concepts of genetics can be found here.
Single gene disorders
DNA contains the instructions for making your body work. DNA is made up of two strands that wind around each other. Each DNA strand includes chemicals called nitrogen bases—T (thymine), A (adenine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine)—that make up the DNA code. Genes are specific sections of DNA that have instructions for making proteins. Proteins make up most of the parts of your body and make your body work the right way.
Some diseases and conditions happen when a person has a genetic change (sometimes called a mutation) in one of their genes. These types of diseases are called single gene disorders. Sometimes, what happens is that one of the DNA bases is changed. For example, part of a gene that usually has the sequence TAC is changed to the sequence TTC. This can change the way the gene works, for example, by changing the protein that is made. In other cases, one or more of the bases in the DNA sequence are missing altogether, or there are extra bases.
Genetic changes can be passed down to a child from their parents. When this happens, the disease or condition is called hereditary or inherited. Or the changes can happen for the first time in the process of making the sperm or egg or early in development, so the child will have the genetic change but the parents will not.
DNA, genes, and chromosomes
DNA is packaged into small units called chromosomes, and each chromosome includes many different genes. Chromosomes come in pairs. Humans have 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Children randomly get one of each pair of chromosomes from each parent. There are 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes, called autosomes, and the chromosomes that form the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. A person born female has two X chromosomes, and a person born male has one X and one Y chromosome.
Single gene disorders that affect a gene on one of the 22 autosomal chromosome pairs are called autosomal disorders. Disorders that affect the sex chromosome are called X-linked disorders. Disorders are further described according to whether the affected genetic change is dominant or recessive.
For some diseases and conditions, everyone who inherits the genetic change will have the disease or condition, but how serious it is can vary from person to person. In other cases, people who have the genetic change will be more likely to develop the disease or condition, but some of them will never develop it.
Autosomal dominant
With autosomal dominant diseases or conditions, a person only needs a genetic change in one copy of the gene to have the disease. If one parent has an autosomal dominant disease or condition, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the genetic change that causes the condition.
Examples of autosomal dominant conditions include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer caused by genetic changes (mutations) to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes; Lynch syndrome; and familial hypercholesterolemia.
Autosomal recessive
With autosomal recessive diseases or conditions, a person needs a genetic change in both copies of the gene to have the disease or condition. While a person with a genetic change in only one copy of the gene will not have the disease or condition, they can still pass the genetic change down to their children. These parents are sometimes called ""carriers"" of the disease because they ""carry"" the genetic change that causes the disease or condition but do not have the disease themselves.
A parent who is a carrier of a disease has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of passing the gene with the genetic change on to each of their children. If both parents are carriers of the disease, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of inheriting two genes with the genetic change and thus of having the disease. Carrier screening looks for autosomal recessive genetic changes in parents to see if they could have a child with the disease or condition.
Examples of autosomal recessive disorders are sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis.
X-linked
Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Each daughter gets an X from her mother and an X from her father. Each son gets an X from his mother and a Y from his father.
Some diseases or conditions happen when a gene on the X chromosome has a genetic change. Because males only have one copy of all the genes on the X chromosome, they are much more likely to be affected by X-linked genetic disorders than females. A female with a genetic change on only one of her two X chromosomes may not have the disease or condition at all. However, in some cases, females with the genetic change on one of their X chromosomes can have the disease or condition, but it is often a milder form of the disease than usually occurs in males.
Because males inherit an X chromosome from their mother, a female with a genetic change on one copy of the gene has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of passing the genetic change on to each of her sons. Her sons could have the disease or condition even though she does not.
Examples of X-linked conditions include fragile X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and hereditary hemophilia.
Chromosomal abnormalities
Different number of chromosomes
People usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes. But sometimes a person is born with a different number. Having an extra chromosome is called trisomy. Missing a chromosome is called monosomy.
For example, people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21. This extra copy changes the body's and brain's normal development and causes intellectual and physical problems for the person. Some disorders are caused by having a different number of sex chromosomes. For example, people with Turner syndrome
usually have only one sex chromosome, an X. Women with Turner syndrome can have problems with growth and heart defects.
Changes in chromosomes
Sometimes chromosomes are incomplete or shaped differently than usual. Missing a small part of a chromosome is called a deletion. A translocation is when part of one chromosome has moved to another chromosome. An inversion is when part of a chromosome has been flipped over.
For example, people with Williams syndrome
are missing a small part of chromosome 7. This deletion can result in intellectual disability and a distinctive facial appearance and personality.
Complex conditions
Complex disorders are caused by genetic changes in many different genes working together with environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposures and behaviors such as air pollution, smoking, alcohol use, the amount of exercise a person gets, or the foods they eat. Having a family health history of a complex condition can make you more likely to have that condition yourself. However, genetic testing would not be recommended because there is not a single genetic change causing the condition that could be found by genetic testing.
Most chronic diseases, such as most cases of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis
, and asthma, are complex disorders. So are most cases of developmental disabilities, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mental health conditions, such as depression
and schizophrenia
.
The vast amount of genetic information available has allowed researchers to develop methods to study which types of genetic changes are found more often in people with a given disease or condition. This allows researchers to estimate a person's risk for a particular disorder based on which genetic changes they have. This estimate is known as the polygenic risk score.
Some important issues need to be considered before polygenic risk scores can be routinely used in health care and public health. Studies are looking at how useful polygenic risk scores are in real-life clinical practice. Information on how each gene change affects disease risk comes from population-level genetic studies. Addressing diversity in development of polygenic risk scores is important, because polygenic risk scores developed from studies in one population (for example, people of Northern European ancestry) might not work as well for other populations (for example, people of West African ancestry). Also, how each gene change affects the polygenic risk score varies from study to study.
Once polygenic risk scores are ready to be used routinely in clinical practice, public health efforts will be needed to address issues such as access, insurance coverage, and sharing of results across health systems.

Genetic Testing
KEY POINTS
Genetic testing looks for changes in your DNA that can inform your medical care.
Talk to your healthcare provider about whether genetic testing is right for you.
What it is
Genetic testing looks for genetic changes, sometimes called mutations or variants, in your DNA. Some genetic changes can cause disease or other health conditions. You inherit your DNA from your parents, so any genetic changes they have can be passed down to you.

Genetics Basics
Genetic testing can give you information to help guide the decisions you make about the medical care you or your family member receives. For example, genetic testing can provide a diagnosis for a genetic condition such as fragile X syndrome or information about your risk of developing cancer. There are many different kinds of genetic tests. Genetic tests use a blood or spit sample, and results are usually ready in a few weeks.
Because we share DNA with our family members, if testing shows that you have a genetic change, your family members may have the same genetic change. Genetic counseling before genetic testing can help make sure you are the right person in your family to get a genetic test and can help make sure you're getting the right test. Genetic counseling after genetic testing can help make sure you understand your results.
Reasons for genetic testing
There are several reasons to consider getting a genetic test, including the following:
To learn whether you have a genetic condition that runs in your family, before you have symptoms
To learn whether you could have a child with a genetic condition
To diagnose a genetic condition if you or your child has symptoms
To understand and guide your cancer prevention or treatment plan
After learning more about genetic testing, you can decide if it's right for you.
Types of genetic tests
There are many different kinds of genetic tests. There is no single genetic test that can detect all genetic conditions. Your healthcare provider can help you decide what genetic test is right for you based on your medical and family history and the condition for which you're being tested.
Single gene testing
Single gene tests look for genetic changes in only one gene. Your healthcare provider might recommend single gene testing if you or your child have symptoms of a specific condition or syndrome that is usually or always caused by changes in the same gene. Examples include Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sickle cell disease. If there is a known genetic change (mutation) in your family, your healthcare provider might recommend single gene testing to check for that change.
Genetic testing panels
Genetic testing panels look for genetic changes in many genes in the same test. Your healthcare provider might recommend a genetic testing panel if you or your child have symptoms of a disease or condition that can be caused by genetic changes in many different genes. Examples include primary immunodeficiency, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. Your healthcare provider might also recommend a genetic testing panel to check for genetic changes that make you more likely to develop a disease such as breast cancer or colorectal (colon) cancer, especially if the disease runs in your family but a specific genetic change that might be causing the disease in family members has not yet been identified.
Large-scale genomic testing
There are two different kinds of large-scale genomic tests, which look for genetic changes throughout a person's DNA:
Exome sequencing
looks at all the genes in the DNA (whole exome) or just the genes that are related to medical conditions (clinical exome).
Whole genome sequencing
is the largest genetic test and looks at all of a person's DNA, not just the genes.
Your healthcare provider might recommend exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing if you or your child has a complex medical condition, or if other testing has not found a genetic cause for a disease or condition. For example, your healthcare provider might recommend whole genome sequencing if you have a rare disorder that appears to have a genetic cause, but none has been found using other tests.12 If your child has autism spectrum disorder, your healthcare provider might recommend whole exome sequencing if other testing does not find a cause.3
Large-scale genetic tests can have findings unrelated to why the test was ordered in the first place. These are called secondary findings, and they can include genetic changes related to adult-onset conditions in children. For example, a child may have exome or genome sequencing to provide a genetic diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder, and a secondary finding is that they have a genetic change that makes them more likely to develop breast cancer as an adult.
Clinical versus direct-to-consumer genetic tests
Clinical genetic tests are different from direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests. Your healthcare provider orders clinical genetic tests for a specific medical reason—you cannot order them on your own. In contrast, you can buy DTC tests online or in a store, for example, to learn more about your ancestry. DTC test results can be used to make decisions about lifestyle choices or identify issues to discuss with your healthcare provider. However, DTC tests cannot determine for certain whether or not you will get a disease. Nor should these tests be used alone to make decisions about your treatment or medical care or in place of clinical genetic testing.
Other tests
Some tests check for changes other than gene changes.
Chromosomes
DNA is packaged into structures called chromosomes. Some tests look for changes in chromosomes rather than in genes. For example, your healthcare provider might recommend a type of chromosome testing called a chromosomal microarray if your child has autism spectrum disorder.
Gene expression
Genes are expressed, or turned on, at different levels in different types of cells. Gene expression tests compare these levels between normal cells and diseased cells, because knowing about the difference can provide important information for treating the disease. For example, these tests can guide chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer.
Understanding test results
Genetic counseling is important to help you understand what the results of your test mean for you. What results mean for you can depend on your family health history, age, and other factors.

Public Health Genomics at CDC
KEY POINTS
CDC's Division of Blood Disorders and Public Health Genomics (DBDPHG) works to promote health, prevent disease, and reduce health inequities for people at increased genetic risk across the lifespan, so they can have the opportunity to be as healthy as possible.
Overview
Thousands of inherited genetic disorders affect millions of people in the United States. Many people with genetic disorders are more likely to
Have health problems.
Require specialized care.
Be hospitalized.
Have higher healthcare costs.
Need to take time off work or school.
Die at a younger age.
In addition, many people with genetic disorders face barriers to health equity that are related to social determinants of health. Social determinants of health refer to conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect health and quality of life. CDC's Division of Blood Disorders and Public Health Genomics (DBDPHG) works to promote health, prevent disease, and reduce health inequities for people with genetic disorders of all ages, so they can be as healthy as possible.

Genetics Basics
WHAT TO KNOW
This page provides information about basic genetic concepts such as DNA, genes, chromosomes, and gene expression.
Genes play a role in almost every human trait and disease.
Advances in our understanding of how genes work have led to improvements in health care and public health.
Overview
Your genes affect many things about you, including how you look (for example, your eye color or height) and how your body works (for example, your blood type). In some cases, your genes are linked to diseases that run in your family. In other cases, your genes influence how your body reacts to health conditions, such as infections; to medicines or other treatments for health conditions; or to certain behaviors, such as smoking or alcohol use.
Better understanding of how genes affect health can improve health in many ways. Knowing if someone has a genetic difference that makes them more likely to get a disease can help them take steps to prevent the disease or find it earlier, when it is easier to treat. If someone already has symptoms of a disease or condition, finding out the genetic difference that causes that disease or condition can help the healthcare provider understand what health outcomes the person might have in the future. Improved understanding of how genes are linked to disease can lead to better treatments for those diseases.
This page provides information about basic genetic concepts such as DNA, genes, chromosomes, and gene expression.
Terms to know
DNA
DNA (which is short for deoxyribonucleic acid) contains the instructions for making your body work. DNA is made up of two strands that wind around each other and looks like a twisting ladder (a shape called a double helix). Each DNA strand includes chemicals called nitrogen bases, which make up the DNA code. There are four different bases, T (thymine), A (adenine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine). Each base on one strand of DNA is paired with a base on the other strand. The paired bases form the ""rungs of the DNA ladder"".
The bases are in different orders on different parts of the DNA strand. DNA is ""read"" by the order of the bases, that is by the order of the Ts, Cs, Gs, and As. The order of these bases is what is known as the DNA sequence. The DNA in almost all living things is made up of the same parts. What's different is the DNA sequence.
Inheritance
Genetic inheritance is the process of passing down DNA from parents to children.
Genome
Your genome is all of the DNA in your body.
Chromosomes
DNA is packaged into small units called chromosomes. A chromosome contains a single, long piece of DNA with many different genes. You inherit your chromosomes from your parents. Chromosomes come in pairs. Humans have 46 chromosomes, in 23 pairs. Children randomly get one of each pair of chromosomes from their mother and one of each pair from their father. There are 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes, called autosomes, and the chromosomes that form the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. They determine if a person is born a male or female. A female has two X chromosomes, and a male has one X and one Y chromosome. Each daughter gets an X from her mother and an X from her father. Each son gets an X from his mother and a Y from his father.
Genes and proteins
Each chromosome has many genes. Genes are specific sections of DNA that have instructions for making proteins. Proteins make up most of the parts of your body and make your body work the right way.
You have two copies of every gene. You inherit one copy from your father and one copy from your mother. The genes people inherit from their parents can determine many things. For example, genes affect what a person will look like and whether the person might have certain diseases.
Alleles
Alleles are forms of the same gene that may have small differences in their sequence of DNA bases. These differences contribute to each person's unique features. Each person has two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. If the alleles of a gene are the same, the person is considered homozygous for the gene. If the alleles are different, the person is considered heterozygous for the gene.
Most of the time, differences between alleles do not have much of an effect on the protein that is made. However, sometimes different alleles can result in differences in traits, such as blood type. Some alleles are associated with health problems or genetic disorders. In these alleles, the differences in the sequence of DNA bases affects the body's ability to make a certain protein.
Because your genes were passed down from your parents, you and your family members share many gene alleles. The more closely related you are, the more gene alleles you have in common.
Cells
Cells are the basic units of life. The human body contains trillions of cells. There are many different types of cells that make up the many different tissues and organs in the body. For example, skin cells, blood cells, heart cells, brain cells, and kidney cells are just a few of the cell types that perform different vital functions in the body.
The basic structure of a cell is a jelly-like substance known as cytoplasm, which is surrounded by a membrane to hold it together. Within the cytoplasm are various specialized structures that are important to the work of the cell. One of these structures is the cell nucleus, which contains the DNA packaged in chromosomes.
Gene expression
Gene expression refers to the process of making proteins using the instructions from genes. A person's DNA includes many genes that have instructions for making proteins. Additionally, certain sections of DNA are not part of a gene but are important in making sure the genes are working properly. These DNA sections provide directions about where in the body each protein should be made, when it should be made, and how much should be made.
For the most part, every cell in a person's body contains exactly the same DNA and genes, but inside individual cells some genes are active (""turned on"") while others are not. Differences in how genes are used (expressed) to make proteins are why the different parts of your body look and work differently. For example, gene expression in the muscles is different from gene expression in the nerves.
Gene expression can change as you age. Also, your behaviors, such as smoking or exercise, or exposures in your environment can affect gene expression.
DNA methylation
DNA methylation works by adding a chemical (known as a methyl group) to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes ""off"" and demethylation turns genes ""on.""
DNA methylation is one of the ways the body controls gene expression. Methylation and demethylation do not change the DNA code (the sequence of the DNA bases), but they help determine how much protein is made.
Genetic change (mutation, gene variant, genetic variant)
A genetic change (sometimes called a mutation, gene variant, or genetic variant) is a change in a DNA base sequence. While not all genetic changes will cause problems, sometimes, changes in genes can lead to changes in proteins and then the proteins don't work the way they are supposed to. This can lead to disease.
Some genetic changes can be passed on from parent to child (inherited). These genetic changes occur in the germ cells, which are the cells that create sperm or eggs. Genetic changes that occur in the other cells in the body (known as somatic cells) do not get passed on to a person's children.
Genetic changes happen when new cells are being made and the DNA is copied. Also, exposures, such as high levels of radiation, can damage the DNA and cause genetic changes. However, most exposures will not result in genetic changes because each cell in the body has a system in place to check for DNA damage and repair the damage once it's found.
Copy number variation (CNV)
Copy number variation (CNV) refers to a feature of the genome, in which various sections of a person's DNA are repeated. While this happens in all people, the number of repeats (or copies) varies from one person to the next. CNVs play an important role in creating genetic diversity in humans. However, some CNVs are linked to diseases.
Environmental factors
Environmental factors include exposures related to where we live, such as air pollution; behaviors, such as smoking and exercise; and other health-related factors, such as the foods that we eat.
Epigenetics
Epigenetics refers to the ways a person's behaviors and the environment can cause changes that affect the way the genes work. Epigenetics turns genes ""on"" and ""off"" and thus is related to gene expression.
Epigenetics change as people age, both as part of normal development and aging and because of exposure to environmental factors that happen over the course of a person's life. There are several different ways an environmental factor can cause an epigenetic change to occur. One of the most common ways is by causing changes to DNA methylation. DNA methylation works by adding a chemical (known as a methyl group) to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes ""off"" and demethylation turns genes ""on."" Thus, environmental factors can impact the amount of protein a cell makes. Less protein might be made if an environmental factor causes an increase in DNA methylation, and more protein might be made if a factor causes an increase in demethylation.

About Genital Herpes
KEY POINTS
Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can be treated.
People who are sexually active can get genital herpes.
This fact sheet answers basic questions about genital herpes.
Overview
What is genital herpes?
Genital herpes is an STI caused by two types of viruses – herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).
Oral herpes
HSV-1 often causes oral herpes, which can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people with oral herpes do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes get it during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva.
Genital herpes is common in the United States (U.S.). In 2018, CDC estimates show there were 572,000 new genital herpes infections in the U.S. among people aged 14 to 49.1
Signs and symptoms
How do I know I have genital herpes?
Genital herpes often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms.
Most people with genital herpes have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. Mild symptoms may go unnoticed or be mistaken for other skin conditions like a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people do not know they have a herpes infection.
Herpes Outbreak
Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. This is known as having an ""outbreak"". The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. Flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, body aches, or swollen glands) also may occur during the first outbreak.
People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if they have HSV-2. However, repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although genital herpes is a lifelong infection, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.
See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods.
Risk factors
What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?
Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, herpes increases the number of immune cells in the lining of the genitals. HIV targets immune cells for entry into the body. Having both HIV and genital herpes increases the chance of spreading HIV to a HIV-negative partner during oral, vagina, or anal sex.
How it spreads
How is genital herpes spread?
You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the infection. You can get herpes if you have contact with:
A herpes sore
Saliva from a partner with an oral herpes infection
Genital fluids from a partner with a genital herpes infection
Skin in the oral area of a partner with oral herpes
Skin in the genital area of a partner with genital herpes
You also can get genital herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or is unaware of their infection. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a partner with oral herpes.
You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools. You also will not get it from touching objects, such as silverware, soap, or towels.
If you have more questions about herpes, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.
Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?
Yes. Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex. This is why some cases of genital herpes are due to HSV-1.
Prevention
How can I prevent genital herpes?
The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who does not have herpes.
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex.
Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that a condom can cover. Also, the skin can release the virus (shed) from areas that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.
If your sex partner(s) has/have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting it if:
Your partner takes an anti-herpes medicine every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her healthcare provider.
You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., during an ""outbreak"").
I'm pregnant. If I have genital herpes, how can I protect my baby from getting it?
If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, prenatal care visits are very important. Some research suggest that a genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage or make it more likely to deliver your baby too early. You can pass herpes to your unborn child before birth, but it more commonly passes during delivery. This can lead to a deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting genital herpes during pregnancy. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had a genital herpes diagnosis or symptoms. Also tell them about any possible exposure to genital herpes.
If you have genital herpes, you may need to take anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes when you deliver. At the time of delivery, your healthcare provider should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have signs or symptoms of genital herpes at delivery, a 'C-section' is likely to occur.
Testing and diagnosis
How will my healthcare provider know if I have genital herpes?
Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at any sores that are present. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. If sores are not present, a blood test may be used to look for HSV antibodies.
Have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider about herpes testing and other STDs.
Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or when you got the infection.
Treatment and recovery
Is there a cure for genital herpes?
There is no cure for genital herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. A daily anti-herpes medicine can make it less likely to pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).
Can I still have sex if I have herpes?
If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) about their risk. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.
You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your health, sex life, and relationships. While herpes is not curable, it is important to know that it is manageable with medicine. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) can lower your risk of spreading the virus to others. Talk to a healthcare provider about your concerns and treatment options.
A genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships. Knowing how to talk to sexual partners about STIs
is important.
What happens if I don't get treated?
Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.
If you touch your sores or fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another body part like your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, quickly wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading the infection.
If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your unborn fetus, or newborn baby. See ""I'm pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?"" for information about this.

Be Antibiotics Aware Partner Toolkit
WHAT TO KNOW
CDC's educational effort, Be Antibiotics Aware, aims to improve antibiotic prescribing and use among target consumer and healthcare professional audiences to protect patient safety and combat antimicrobial resistance.
U.S. Antibiotic Awareness Week (USAAW) is an annual observance that raises awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and the importance of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal use.
Be Antibiotics Aware complements USAAW by providing partners with key messages, sample social media posts, and graphics and videos they can use to spread the word within their organization.
Overview
USAAW 2024: Fighting Antimicrobial Resistance Takes All of Us
USAAW is an annual observance that raises awareness of the threat of AR and its impact on human health. This year, CDC is focusing on how fighting antimicrobial resistance takes all of us by sharing calls to action for diverse audiences.
Antibiotics can save lives and are critical tools for treating common and serious infections, including those that can lead to sepsis.
Any time antibiotics or antifungals are used, they can cause side effects and contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance, one of the most urgent threats to the public's health.
Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs, like bacteria and fungi, develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur in the United States each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. Many more die from complications from antimicrobial-resistant infections.
Improving how healthcare professionals prescribe and how patients take antibiotics can help keep patients healthy from adverse events, combat antimicrobial resistance, and help ensure these life-saving drugs will be available for future generations.
Each year during USAAW, CDC works collaboratively with federal, domestic, and international partners to raise awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and highlight the critical importance of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal use. Check out CDC's U.S. Antibiotic Awareness Week webpage to help spread the word.
The observance is an international collaboration, coinciding with:
European Antibiotic Awareness Day
Australia's Antimicrobial Awareness Week
Canada's Antimicrobial Awareness Week
World AMR Awareness Week

About Giardia Infection
KEY POINTS
Giardia is a tiny parasite (germ) that causes diarrhea.
Giardia can spread easily from one person to another or through water, food, surfaces, or objects.
A healthcare provider can prescribe medicine to treat illness caused by Giardia.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Giardia duodenalis (Giardia for short) is a parasite. Illness caused by Giardia is called giardiasis.
Giardia lives in the gut of infected people and animals and comes out of the body in poop. Giardia can survive for weeks to months outside the body (for example, in soil).
In the United States, more people get sick from Giardia than from any other parasite that lives in the gut. Every year, more than 1 million people get sick from Giardia.
Giardia is found in every region of the United States and around the world.
Symptoms
Symptoms usually begin by having diarrhea 2 to 5 times per day and feeling more and more tired.
Short-term symptoms include:
Diarrhea
Gas
Smelly, greasy poop that can float
Stomach cramps or pain
Upset stomach or nausea
Dehydration (loss of fluids)
Symptoms usually begin 1 to 2 weeks after becoming infected with Giardia and last for 2 to 6 weeks. Occasionally, people have long-term symptoms that can last for years.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Giardia Infection
Who is at risk
Anyone can get sick from Giardia. However, children are more likely to get sick than adults.
You are more likely to get sick if you:
Are in close contact with someone who is sick from Giardia, especially in childcare settings
Are in an area with limited access to safe drinking water
Drink untreated water from springs, lakes, rivers, or shallow wells
Swallow water from pools, splash pads, lakes, or rivers (for example, while swimming)
Have a weakened immune system
Have contact with poop during sex
Have contact with infected animals or animal environments contaminated with poop
How it spreads
You can get sick if you swallow Giardia.
Giardia germs are in poop, so anything that gets contaminated by poop can potentially spread the germs. Giardia can spread from one person to another or through contaminated water, food, surfaces, or objects.
Giardia spreads easily; swallowing just a few Giardia germs can make you sick.
Keep Reading:
Giardia Infection: Causes and How It Spreads
Prevention
You can take steps to avoid getting or spreading Giardia:
Wash your hands with soap and water at key times.
Avoid swallowing water while swimming.
Boil or filter water from lakes, springs, or rivers before drinking or preparing food with it.
Wait to have sex for several weeks after you or your partner no longer have diarrhea.
Avoid touching animal poop.
Clean and disinfect areas where a person or pet recently had diarrhea.
Boil lake or river water for at least 1 minute to kill Giardia (at elevations above 6,500 feet, boil for 3 minutes)
Keep Reading:
Giardia Infection Prevention and Control
Diagnosis
Contact a healthcare provider if you think you may be sick from Giardia. They will ask you to give stool (poop) samples to see if Giardia is making you sick.
Keep Reading:
Testing and Diagnosis for Giardia Infection
Treatment and recovery
Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicine to treat illness caused by Giardia.
If you have diarrhea, drink a lot of water or other fluids to avoid dehydration (loss of fluids).
Keep Reading:
Treatment of Giardia Infection
Animal transmission
Although animals can spread Giardia to people, you are unlikely to get a Giardia infection from dogs or cats. The type of Giardia that makes people sick is usually not the same type that makes dogs and cats sick.

About Giardia Infection
KEY POINTS
Giardia is a tiny parasite (germ) that causes diarrhea.
Giardia can spread easily from one person to another or through water, food, surfaces, or objects.
A healthcare provider can prescribe medicine to treat illness caused by Giardia.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Giardia duodenalis (Giardia for short) is a parasite. Illness caused by Giardia is called giardiasis.
Giardia lives in the gut of infected people and animals and comes out of the body in poop. Giardia can survive for weeks to months outside the body (for example, in soil).
In the United States, more people get sick from Giardia than from any other parasite that lives in the gut. Every year, more than 1 million people get sick from Giardia.
Giardia is found in every region of the United States and around the world.
Symptoms
Symptoms usually begin by having diarrhea 2 to 5 times per day and feeling more and more tired.
Short-term symptoms include:
Diarrhea
Gas
Smelly, greasy poop that can float
Stomach cramps or pain
Upset stomach or nausea
Dehydration (loss of fluids)
Symptoms usually begin 1 to 2 weeks after becoming infected with Giardia and last for 2 to 6 weeks. Occasionally, people have long-term symptoms that can last for years.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Giardia Infection
Who is at risk
Anyone can get sick from Giardia. However, children are more likely to get sick than adults.
You are more likely to get sick if you:
Are in close contact with someone who is sick from Giardia, especially in childcare settings
Are in an area with limited access to safe drinking water
Drink untreated water from springs, lakes, rivers, or shallow wells
Swallow water from pools, splash pads, lakes, or rivers (for example, while swimming)
Have a weakened immune system
Have contact with poop during sex
Have contact with infected animals or animal environments contaminated with poop
How it spreads
You can get sick if you swallow Giardia.
Giardia germs are in poop, so anything that gets contaminated by poop can potentially spread the germs. Giardia can spread from one person to another or through contaminated water, food, surfaces, or objects.
Giardia spreads easily; swallowing just a few Giardia germs can make you sick.
Keep Reading:
Giardia Infection: Causes and How It Spreads
Prevention
You can take steps to avoid getting or spreading Giardia:
Wash your hands with soap and water at key times.
Avoid swallowing water while swimming.
Boil or filter water from lakes, springs, or rivers before drinking or preparing food with it.
Wait to have sex for several weeks after you or your partner no longer have diarrhea.
Avoid touching animal poop.
Clean and disinfect areas where a person or pet recently had diarrhea.
Boil lake or river water for at least 1 minute to kill Giardia (at elevations above 6,500 feet, boil for 3 minutes)
Keep Reading:
Giardia Infection Prevention and Control
Diagnosis
Contact a healthcare provider if you think you may be sick from Giardia. They will ask you to give stool (poop) samples to see if Giardia is making you sick.
Keep Reading:
Testing and Diagnosis for Giardia Infection
Treatment and recovery
Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicine to treat illness caused by Giardia.
If you have diarrhea, drink a lot of water or other fluids to avoid dehydration (loss of fluids).
Keep Reading:
Treatment of Giardia Infection
Animal transmission
Although animals can spread Giardia to people, you are unlikely to get a Giardia infection from dogs or cats. The type of Giardia that makes people sick is usually not the same type that makes dogs and cats sick.

About The Epidemiology Elective Program
AT A GLANCE
The Epidemiology Elective Program (EEP) is an elective rotation for medical and veterinary students. Most students earn academic course credit.
EEP offers 6- and 8-week rotations. Students learn applied epidemiology through training, project assignments, and mentorship from public health experts.
Project assignments are with CDC, other federal agencies, and state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments.
Background
The Epidemiology Elective Program (EEP) is a short-term, service-learning rotation in applied epidemiology. Medical and veterinary students learn through training, project assignments, and mentorship from public health experts.
Students can participate in a 6- or 8-week rotation. Projects assignments are with CDC, other federal agencies, and state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments. Every effort is made to place students with a host site that provides experience in leadership and project in a topic area of the student's interest.
Project assignments involve helping public health experts investigate public health problems such as infectious disease outbreaks, natural disasters, chronic diseases, and poor access to healthcare.
Most schools award academic course credit for participation in EEP.

Check out and share the EEP flyer.
Impact
More than 2,100 medical and veterinary students have completed EEP since its inception in 1975. Many students go on to participate in CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program and become public health leaders.
Meet Amy Xie, MD, a 2020 EEP student who joined EIS in 2023
Dr. Xie had this to say about her EEP rotation: ""Working alongside a CDC medical officer and EIS officer during a coronavirus field investigation enabled me to learn about public health response through first-hand experience. I got to see how decisions are made and how an incident command team is structured. I had the chance to contribute to field investigation information that was published in two Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports. I see great value in being a physician with epidemiology training!""

Global Health Security
KEY POINTS
Global health security is national security. CDC's global staff are part of the first line of defense to stop outbreaks where they start.
Global health security means being able to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats globally.
CDC works to protect the health, safety, and security of the American people and fight global health threats worldwide.
Overview
CDC supports training workers, improving diagnostics and specimen transport systems, and strengthening health systems to quickly stop outbreaks before they spread.
Global health security is the existence of strong and resilient public health systems that can prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, wherever they occur in the world. In today's interconnected world, a disease threat anywhere is a threat everywhere – and outbreaks can disrupt American lives and livelihoods even if they never reach America's shores.
As the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks have demonstrated, diseases can cross borders, disrupt societies, and threaten global stability. Strengthening global health security is a vital national security priority, and is essential to protecting the health, lives, and economic well-being of the American people.
As the United States' health protection agency, CDC works 24/7 to save lives and protect people from health threats.
Core capabilities further our mission
CDC is a critical part of the U.S. government-wide effort to promote global health security. CDC works with countries around the world to detect and respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks and stop them at their source to prevent further spread.
No matter the threat, we know we can protect the health of Americans and people around the world by strengthening six core public health capabilities:
Data and surveillance
Laboratory
Workforce and institutions
Prevention and response
Innovation and research
Policy, communications, and diplomacy
How we do it
CDC's Global Health Strategic Framework is a bridge that connects all of CDC's global health activities. Learn how we use it to measure progress and impact, and guide informed decision-making for global health activities across CDC.
CDC's Global Health Strategic Framework
Longstanding expertise
CDC has over 60 country and regional offices that implement our global health programming, which addresses hundreds of diseases, health threats, and conditions that are major causes of death, disease, and disability. CDC's decades-long global health investments, training, and scientific diplomacy strengthen global capacity in laboratories, data, emergency response and the public health workforce. Thanks to extensive global presence and decades-long trusted partnerships, CDC's global staff are often the first call by host country governments when disease outbreaks start.
Collaborative efforts
Building global health security can't be accomplished alone. CDC assistance to partner countries has resulted in substantial improvements to their readiness to fight infectious disease threats. To accomplish global health security goals, CDC works closely with other U.S. government agencies, ministries of health, international organizations, and in-country partners.
U.S. Global Health Security Strategy
The United States and the international community can only achieve global, sustainable health security by working with all countries. The U.S. Government released the 2024 Global Health Security Strategy (GHSS)
outlining U.S. efforts to prevent and prepare for the next pandemic, and to protect Americans and people around the globe from health security threats. CDC has long supported partner governments to address critical, immediate health needs and strengthen their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to emerging health threats.
Global Health Security Agenda
The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA)
aims to strengthen the world’s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. More than 70 countries have signed onto the GHSA framework. The United States made a strong commitment to the initial five-year period of GHSA and continues to support its strategic priorities. GHSA 2024's targets are for countries to take greater ownership of global health security efforts and improve health-security-related technical areas.
Joint External Evaluation
To measure countries' progress towards meeting GHSA goals, CDC and its partners developed the Joint External Evaluation (JEE). The JEE is a voluntary evaluation process that gives countries a starting point for improving their health security. Countries can use the JEE to identify their strengths and point out the most urgent needs within their health systems. This transparent, external evaluation process encourages countries to exchange vital information and work together towards a safer, healthier world.

Global Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
KEY POINTS
Global access to safe water, sanitation, and proper hygiene education can reduce illness and death from disease, improve health, reduce poverty, and help economic growth.
Every year, diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid fever cause millions of illnesses and deaths, yet they can be prevented with better WASH practices.
Overview
Everyone needs clean water, safe toilets, and good hygiene habits to stay healthy, but not everyone has access to these essentials. Today, millions of people around the world do not have clean water to drink, and billions do not have a safe place to go to the bathroom. This can lead to serious illnesses like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, which are especially dangerous for infants and children.
Access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene remains a significant global challenge, with over 2 billion people
lacking clean drinking water at home, 1.5 billion lacking basic sanitation facilities, and 2 billion lacking basic hygiene services
.
Universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene has the potential to greatly reduce global disease burden. Investing in water and sanitation interventions brings economic, environmental, quality of life, and health benefits. WASH also plays a key role in improving nutritional outcomes, particularly among children.
Global impact of waterborne infections
Unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene play a major role in spreading diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. These conditions also contribute to the emergence of more dangerous forms of diseases, such as extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever. Addressing these challenges requires dedicated efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices. These improvements are necessary for preventing the spread of disease and dealing with emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant infections.
Harmful germs, parasites, or toxic chemicals can contaminate water. This contaminated water comes from human or animal waste, pesticides, and industrial waste. This can make people sick with diseases like cholera, typhoid, polio, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five years old. The primary risk factors for diarrhea include unsafe water and sanitation, along with childhood malnutrition.
In addition, not having access to clean water, toilets, and good hygiene practices makes it harder to stop and manage neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis, trachoma, and Guinea worm disease. This keeps the cycle of poverty and sickness going. Having reliable access to safe water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices significantly reduces the burden of disease globally.
Key facts highlight the impact of these conditions:
Diarrhea is a major cause of mortality among children under five, with about 88% of these deaths attributable to WASH issues.
Cholera affects 47 countries, primarily impacting vulnerable populations, with efforts focusing on improving WASH and vaccination to prevent outbreaks.
Typhoid fever, notably its drug-resistant strains, underscores the importance of enhanced sanitation, hygiene, and vaccination efforts for prevention.
Improving WASH infrastructure and practices is key to breaking the cycle of disease and poverty and highlights the need for global efforts to ensure everyone has access to safe water and sanitation.

Today, millions of people around the world do not have clean water to drink, and billions do not have a safe place to go to the bathroom. This can lead to serious illnesses like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, which are especially dangerous for infants and children.
Access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene remains a significant global challenge, with over 2 billion people
lacking clean drinking water at home, 1.5 billion lacking basic sanitation facilities, and 2 billion lacking basic hygiene services
.
Universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene has the potential to greatly reduce global disease burden. Investing in water and sanitation interventions brings economic, environmental, quality of life, and health benefits. WASH also plays a key role in improving nutritional outcomes, particularly among children.
Global impact of waterborne infections
Unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene play a major role in spreading diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. These conditions also contribute to the emergence of more dangerous forms of diseases, such as extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever. Addressing these challenges requires dedicated efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices. These improvements are necessary for preventing the spread of disease and dealing with emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant infections.
Harmful germs, parasites, or toxic chemicals can contaminate water. This contaminated water comes from human or animal waste, pesticides, and industrial waste. This can make people sick with diseases like cholera, typhoid, polio, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five years old. The primary risk factors for diarrhea include unsafe water and sanitation, along with childhood malnutrition.
In addition, not having access to clean water, toilets, and good hygiene practices makes it harder to stop and manage neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis, trachoma, and Guinea worm disease. This keeps the cycle of poverty and sickness going. Having reliable access to safe water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices significantly reduces the burden of disease globally.
Key facts highlight the impact of these conditions:
Diarrhea is a major cause of mortality among children under five, with about 88% of these deaths attributable to WASH issues.
Cholera affects 47 countries, primarily impacting vulnerable populations, with efforts focusing on improving WASH and vaccination to prevent outbreaks.
Typhoid fever, notably its drug-resistant strains, underscores the importance of enhanced sanitation, hygiene, and vaccination efforts for prevention.
Improving WASH infrastructure and practices is key to breaking the cycle of disease and poverty and highlights the need for global efforts to ensure everyone has access to safe water and sanitation.

About Gnathostomiasis
KEY POINTS
Human gnathostomiasis is a condition caused by several species of parasitic worms (nematodes).
You can get infected by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish, eels, frogs, birds, and reptiles.
You can treat Gnathostoma infection with medication.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Gnathostoma spp. are a group of parasitic worms or nematodes. They pass through a series of animal hosts to complete their lifecycle.
Lifecycle
Depending on the species, adult Gnathostoma spp. can reproduce in dogs, cats, raccoons, opossums, tigers, leopards, pigs, wild boars, and weasels. These animals are called definitive hosts. The definitive host will release the parasites' eggs in their stool (poop) where they will hatch in freshwater. Copepods (also known as tiny ""water fleas""), then eat the larvae in freshwater. In turn, animals such as freshwater fish, eels, frogs, birds, and reptiles eat the copepods. If definitive hosts eat one of these infected animals, they can become infected and the larvae can mature into the adult form and complete the life cycle.
If humans eat raw or undercooked meat from one of these infected animals, they too can become infected. However, the larvae of the parasite cannot mature the adult form.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Gnathostomiasis page.
Signs and symptoms
Experts think the symptoms of gnathostomiasis are related to the movement of the parasite through the body. When someone eats the parasite, it moves through the wall of the stomach or intestine and liver. During this early phase, many people have no symptoms. Or they may experience fever, excess tiredness, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. This phase may last for two or three weeks.
Later, when the parasite moves under the skin, people may experience swellings under the skin that may be painful, red, or itchy. The swellings move around and typically are not pitting. This means that if you push on the swelling with a finger, you will not see an indentation left behind. The swellings often begin within three to four weeks after ingestion of the parasite, but they can occur up to around 10 years after infection. The swellings typically last several weeks at a time. Rarely, Gnathostoma can enter other parts of the body, including the lungs, bladder, eyes, ears, and nervous system, including the brain.
Causes
You can get Gnathostoma infection by eating undercooked or raw infected freshwater fish. You can also become infected by eating raw or undercooked infected freshwater eels, frogs, birds, and reptiles.
People might also become infected by swallowing infected copepods or through exposure to the parasite while handling uncooked tissue from animals that are infected, though this is unproven.
You can find Gnathostoma spp. throughout the world. However, infections are most commonly diagnosed in Asia, particularly Thailand, other parts of Southeast Asia, and Japan. People have reported cases in other areas, including South and Central America and Africa.
Experts believe people do not get the parasite by eating sushi in the U.S. and Western Europe. This is because there are more stringent regulations in these areas on sourcing and storage of fish eaten by humans.
Prevention
The best way to not get gnathostomiasis is to not eat undercooked or raw freshwater fish, eels, frogs, birds, and reptiles. Marinating freshwater fish in lime juice, like when making ceviche, does not kill the parasite. Avoiding contaminated freshwater in areas where the parasite is commonly found, washing your hands with soap and warm water before and after preparing food, and wearing gloves when handling raw tissue from animals that might be infected may also reduce your risk of infection, though none of these has proven effective.
The FDA recommends the following for fish preparation or storage to kill parasites.
Cooking
Cook fish adequately (to an internal temperature of at least 145° F [~63° C]).
Freezing (Fish)
At -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid, and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours.
Diagnosis
See your healthcare provider if you have any of the symptoms of Gnathostoma infection. Only specialty labs located outside of the United States can test your blood for Gnathostoma infection.
Treatment and recovery
There are safe and effective medications to treat Gnathostoma infection. Talk to your healthcare provider about treatment.

About Gonorrhea
KEY POINTS
Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can be treated.
People who are sexually active can get gonorrhea.
This fact sheet answers basic questions about gonorrhea.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
What is gonorrhea?
Gonorrhea is an STI that can cause infection in the genitals, rectum, and throat. It is very common, especially among young people ages 15-24 years.
Signs and symptoms
How do I know if I have gonorrhea?
Gonorrhea often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms.
Symptoms in women
Most women with gonorrhea do not have any symptoms. Even when a woman has symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. Symptoms in women can include:
Painful or burning sensation when peeing
Increased vaginal discharge
Vaginal bleeding between periods
Symptoms in men
Men who do have symptoms may have:
A burning sensation when peeing
A white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis
Painful or swollen testicles (although this is less common)
Symptoms from rectal infections
Rectal infections may either cause no symptoms or cause symptoms in both men and women that may include:
Discharge
Anal itching
Soreness
Bleeding
Painful bowel movements
See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods.
Risk factors
Am I at risk for gonorrhea?
Sexually active people can get gonorrhea through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with a partner who has gonorrhea.
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for gonorrhea or other STIs.
How it spreads
How is gonorrhea spread?
You can get gonorrhea by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with someone who has the infection. A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can give the infection to her baby during childbirth.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of getting gonorrhea?
The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, the following things can lower your chances of getting gonorrhea:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have gonorrhea.
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex.
I'm pregnant. If I have gonorrhea, how can I protect my baby from getting it?
If you are pregnant and have gonorrhea, you can give the infection to your baby during delivery. This can cause serious health problems for your baby. If you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about getting the correct examination, testing, and treatment. Treating gonorrhea as soon as possible will make health problems for your baby less likely.
Testing and diagnosis
Should I be tested for gonorrhea?
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for gonorrhea or other STIs.
If you are a sexually active gay or bisexual man, you should get tested for gonorrhea every year. If you are a sexually active woman, you should get tested for gonorrhea every year if you are:
Younger than 25 years
25 years and older with risk factors, such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection
Testing is also recommended during pregnancy in some cases.
How will my healthcare provider know if I have gonorrhea?
Most of the time, a healthcare provider will use a a urine sample to diagnose gonorrhea. However, if you have had oral and/or anal sex, your healthcare provider may use swabs to collect samples from your throat and/or rectum. In some cases, a healthcare provider may also use a swab to collect a sample from a man's urethra (urine canal) or a woman's cervix (opening to the womb).
Treatment and recovery
Is there a cure for gonorrhea?
Yes, the right treatment can cure gonorrhea. It is important that you take all of the medicine your healthcare provider gives you to cure your infection. Do not share medicine for gonorrhea with anyone. Although medicine will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease.
It is becoming harder to treat some gonorrhea, as drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea are increasing. Return to a healthcare provider if your symptoms continue for more than a few days after receiving treatment.
When can I have sex again after my gonorrhea treatment?
Wait seven days after finishing all medicine before having sex. You and your sex partner(s) should avoid having sex until you have each completed treatment and your symptoms are gone. This will help prevent you and your partner(s) from giving or getting gonorrhea again. Those with gonorrhea should be retested about three months after treatment of an initial infection, even if their partners received successful treatment.
If you've had gonorrhea and took medicine in the past, you can still get it again. This happens if you have sex without a condom with a person who has gonorrhea.
What happens if I don't get treated?
Untreated gonorrhea can cause serious and permanent health problems.
In women, untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are:
Formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes
Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the womb
)
Infertility (not being able to get pregnant)
Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain
In men, gonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles, which can, in rare cases, lead to infertility.
Rarely, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to your blood or joints. This condition can be life-threatening.
Untreated gonorrhea may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV.

Drug-Resistant Gonorrhea
WHAT TO KNOW
The bacteria that cause gonorrhea has grown resistant to nearly every drug ever used to treat it. It's only a matter of time until it becomes resistant to the last available cure.
Drug-Resistant Gonorrhea: An Overview
Drug resistance, also referred to as antimicrobial resistance, happens when germs like bacteria and fungi develop the ability to resist, and even defeat, the drugs designed to kill them. That means the germs are not killed and continue to grow. Gonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly all the antibiotics used for its treatment. We are currently down to one last recommended and effective class of antibiotics, cephalosporins, to treat this common infection. This is an urgent public health threat because gonorrhea control in the United States largely relies on our ability to successfully treat the infection.
Gonorrhea is skilled at outsmarting the antibiotics that are used to kill it. For this reason, we must continuously monitor for resistance and encourage the research and development of new drugs for gonorrhea treatment.
Surveillance
Surveillance for resistant gonorrhea in the United States is conducted through several projects: the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), the enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (eGISP), and Strengthening the United States Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG). Antibiotic susceptibility testing is an activity common to each project.
Gonorrhea has decreased susceptibility to a given antibiotic when laboratory results indicate that higher-than-expected levels of an antibiotic are needed to stop its growth.
CDC also recommends that isolates from certain infections be submitted to the CDC STD Lab for confirmation. These infections comprise those that fail to respond to CDC-recommended therapy and isolates determined to exhibit intermediate resistance or resistance.
Suspected Gonorrhea Treatment Failure Consultation Form
Healthcare providers and health departments can report suspected gonorrhea cephalosporin treatment failure or any N. gonorrhoeae specimen with decreased cephalosporin susceptibility through the Suspected Gonorrhea Treatment Failure Consultation Form.
For questions about reporting a suspected treatment failure or resistant case, please email: GCFAILURE@cdc.gov
Laboratory Challenges
Culture testing is when bacteria is first grown on a nutrient plate and is then exposed to known amounts of an antibiotic to determine the bacteria's susceptibility to the antibiotic. A major challenge to monitoring emerging resistant gonorrhea is the substantial decline in the use of gonorrhea culture testing by many clinicians, as well as the reduced capability of many laboratories to perform the gonorrhea culture techniques required for antibiotic susceptibility testing. The decline in culture testing results from an increased use of newer laboratory technology, such as a diagnostic test called the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT). Currently, there is no well-studied, reliable technology that allows for antibiotic susceptibility testing from nonculture specimens. Increased laboratory culture capacity is needed.
CDC recommends that all state and local health department labs maintain or develop the capacity to perform gonorrhea culture, or form partnerships with experienced laboratories that can perform this type of testing.
See lab methods for gonorrhea testing.
A Timeline of Drug Resistance and Changing Treatments
In 1993, ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, and two cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefixime) were the recommended treatments for gonorrhea. However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in Hawaii and the West Coast. By 2004, ciprofloxacin- resistant gonorrhea had significantly increased among men who have sex with men (MSM) leading to the discontinuation of the drug in this population. By 2006, nearly 14% of gonorrhea samples were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin resistance was present in all regions of the country and in the heterosexual population. On April 13, 2007, CDC stopped recommending fluoroquinolones as empiric treatment for gonorrhea altogether. The cephalosporins, either cefixime or ceftriaxone, were the only remaining recommended treatments.
Similar to trends observed elsewhere in the world, CDC observed worrisome trends of decreasing cephalosporin susceptibility. To preserve cephalosporins for as long as possible, CDC has updated its STI Treatment Guidelines frequently since 2010. Currently, just one regimen is recommended as first-line treatment for gonorrhea: a single 500 mg dose of the injectable cephalosporin, ceftriaxone.
CDC continues to monitor resistance to cephalosporins and other drugs.
CDC has not received any reports of verified clinical treatment failures to any cephalosporin in the United States.

Gout
KEY POINTS
Gout is a painful type of arthritis that usually affects one joint at a time, often the big toe.
It causes periods of severe pain and swelling in the affected joint, called flares.
There are treatments to reduce gout symptoms during a flare.
People can also prevent or reduce flares by changing their diet and other lifestyle behaviors or taking medicines.
Overview
Gout basics
Gout is a painful type of arthritis that usually affects one joint at a time.
When your body has extra uric acid (a normal body waste product), crystals can form in a joint and cause severe pain and swelling.
Symptoms of gout may come and go.
Gout flares
When gout symptoms get bad, this is called a flare.
A person may experience sudden symptoms that last for days or weeks.
Then, there may be periods without any symptoms (called remissions), before the next flare.
Over time, if left untreated:
Flares may happen more often and last longer.
Lumps called tophi stones may form. Tophi stones are caused by uncontrolled uric acid levels. They can become painful and damage joints.
Signs and symptoms
People with gout may have symptoms in the affected joint, such as:
Pain.
Swelling.
Redness.
Heat.
High uric acid levels can form painful crystals around a joint.
Things that increase risk of gout
Certain things can increase the body's levels of uric acid, which may lead to gout. These include:
Obesity.
Certain medicines, such as water pills (or diuretics).
Foods and drinks that are high in purines (a chemical compound that the body turns into uric acid) such as:
Alcohol.
Sugary drinks.
Sugary foods, like snacks with high fructose corn syrup.
Red meat and shellfish.
Who gets gout
Anyone can get gout. But it is more common in certain groups of people, including:
Men.
People with a family history of gout.
People with health conditions like:
Heart failure.
High blood pressure.
Insulin resistance.
Diabetes.
Poor kidney function.
Diagnosis
Finding out if you have gout
It is important to be diagnosed with gout early so you can start treating it quickly.
Since gout symptoms can look like other diseases, a doctor should diagnose it.
Gout is typically diagnosed during a flare, when it is easiest to spot uric acid crystals in the affected joint.
Not everyone with high uric acid levels will develop gout.
A doctor will diagnose gout by doing:
A physical exam.
X-rays.
Lab tests.
A review of your health history.
Managing gout
Treatment
Talk to your health care provider about:
Prescription and over-the-counter drugs, like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, to reduce pain and swelling during a flare.
Prescription drugs to lower uric acid levels and prevent flares and tophi stones.
Self-care for gout
In addition to medications, there are things you can do on your own to help manage gout.
Be physically active—for at least 150 minutes per week at moderate-intensity.
Limit foods and drinks that are high in purines. These include:
Alcohol, especially beer and hard liquor.
Sugary foods and drinks.
Red meats and organ meats.
Certain seafood, like anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout, and tuna.
Learn more about self-care strategies and programs for arthritis, which can also help with gout. Local and remote programs are available.
Eating foods that are low in purines is important for gout management.

About Gram-negative Bacteria
KEY POINTS
Gram-negative bacteria can cause serious infections in healthcare settings.
Infections from these bacteria are becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to antimicrobial resistance.
To prevent these infections, healthcare providers should follow recommended infection control practices.
Overview
Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis in healthcare settings. These infections can be hard to treat since the bacteria causing them can become resistant to common antibiotics. Resistance to most or all antibiotics has also been reported.
Types
Klebsiella
Acinetobacter
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
E. coli
And more
Who is at risk
Patients in healthcare settings are at highest risk.
Prevention
Patients and caregivers should follow CDC guidelines on patient safety.
Healthcare providers and facilities should follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Testing
CDC collaborates with laboratories to identify and recommend tests to detect gram-negative bacteria.
Keep Reading:
Laboratory Testing for Gram Negative
Treatment
Gram-negative infections can be difficult to treat. Some types of gram-negative bacteria can become resistant to multiple drugs, including (and increasingly) antibiotics like carbapenems.
What CDC is doing
Providing testing to identify antimicrobial resistance cases, measure resistance and track transmission in a healthcare setting through the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network.
Tracking gram-negative bacteria infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and slow the spread of resistant germs.

About Acanthamoeba Infections
KEY POINTS
Acanthamoeba is a free-living ameba, a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water, soil, and dust.
Most people will come into contact with Acanthamoeba at some point, but most won't get sick. Although rare, some people develop serious Acanthamoeba infections that are often fatal.
See a healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of an Acanthamoeba infection.
Overview
Most people will be exposed to Acanthamoeba during their lifetime. The ameba is found in soil and dust as well fresh water and saltwater. It can also be found in swimming pools, hot tubs, drinking water systems, humidifiers, and in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
Most people exposed to Acanthamoeba won't get sick. For others, it can cause serious infections of the brain, skin, eyes, and sinuses. Acanthamoeba can infect parts of the body through cuts or skin wounds or from being inhaled into the lungs or nostrils. It can get into the eyes through contact lens use.
Types
Non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections
High resolution of Acanthamoeba in a patient's brain
Non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections are rare but serious infections that can affect one or many parts of the body. These infections usually occur in people with weakened immune systems and include:
Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), which affects the brain and is almost always fatal
Cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, a skin infection
Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis, an infection of the nasal cavity and sinuses
Disseminated infection, which affects multiple parts of the body. GAE, cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, and Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis can all spread to cause disseminated infections.

Free-living amebas
A free-living ameba is a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water and soil around the world. Most people will come into contact with these amebas during their lives but won't get sick. Others will develop rare but serious infections.
Although there are several types of free-living amebas that live in the environment, three are known to cause severe disease in people:
Acanthamoeba
Balamuthia mandrillaris
Naegleria fowleri
All of these amebas can cause life-threatening brain infections. Some can also cause infections of the eyes, skin, sinuses, and other parts of the body.

About Balamuthia Infections
KEY POINTS
Balamuthia mandrillaris is a free-living ameba, a kind of one-celled organism that lives in the environment.
The ameba can get into your body through a wound, or if you breathe it in.
Balamuthia can cause rare but serious illnesses, including a brain infection that is nearly always fatal.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Balamuthia lives in water, soil, and dust. It has been found in many places around the world. The ameba can infect your skin, brain, and other organs. It can cause a deadly brain infection called granulomatous amebic encephalitis, or GAE.

Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of a Balamuthia infection can begin with a wound on your skin that doesn’t heal quickly. Symptoms of GAE can appear mild at first and include fever, headache, or confusion. They can become more severe over weeks or months and include difficulty walking and speaking.
Keep Reading:
Signs and Symptoms of Balamuthia
How it spreads
Balamuthia  can infect anyone at any time of the year. You can become infected if water or soil containing the ameba gets into a wound. You also can become infected breathing in dust containing Balamuthia.
There are no reports of a Balamuthia infection spreading from person to person except in very rare situations during organ transplantation.
Keep Reading:
What Causes Balamuthia
Reducing risk
At this time, we don't know how to prevent Balamuthia infections. We also don't know why some people get infected while others don't. CDC continues to track Balamuthia  infections so we can learn more about  them and how to prevent them.
Diagnosis
Doctors and scientists use special tests to identify Balamuthia infections. The tests are not widely available, but CDC can help with testing.
Keep Reading:
Clinical Testing and Diagnosis for Balamuthia Infection
Treatment and recovery
Contact your healthcare provider right away if you think you have a Balamuthia infection.
Nine out of 10 people with GAE do not survive. Early diagnosis and treatment may increase chances of survival.
Treatment for GAE currently includes a combination of several drugs. Most cases are diagnosed just before someone dies or after their death. This limits what we know about using different drugs to treat GAE.

ESPAÑOL
About Group A Strep Infection
KEY POINTS
Group A Streptococcus (group A strep bacteria) can cause many different infections.
These infections range from minor to serious.
Group A strep bacteria can also cause inflammatory diseases.
Group A strep bacteria are contagious.
Generally, people spread the bacteria to others through respiratory droplets or direct contact.
What it is
Group A Streptococcus are bacteria.
Types
Group A strep bacteria can cause many different types of infections that range from minor to serious. The bacteria can also cause inflammatory diseases.
The following are some, but not all, of the conditions associated with group A strep bacteria.
Minor infections
The following infections caused by group A strep bacteria are generally mild:
Impetigo
Scarlet fever
Strep throat
Serious infections
Three infections caused by group A strep bacteria can be very serious and even deadly:
Cellulitis
Necrotizing fasciitis
Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome
Inflammatory diseases
Long-term health issues related to group A strep bacteria include:
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
Rheumatic fever
Both are thought to be caused by an immune response to an earlier group A strep infection. As the body's defense system, the immune system is important in fighting off infections. But the immune system can mistakenly attack healthy parts of the body and cause damage.
Risk factors for serious infections
Who's at increased risk of getting any specific condition listed above varies. However, some people are generally at increased risk of getting a serious group A strep infection.
Viral infections, like flu or chickenpox, can increase this risk.
Medical conditions that can increase the risk for getting a serious group A strep infection include:
Cancer
Chronic heart, kidney, or lung disease
Diabetes
Immunocompromising condition (having a weakened immune system)
Wounds or skin disease
Other groups at increased risk for getting a serious group A strep infection include:
American Indian and Alaska Native populations
People aged 65 years or older
People who inject drugs or who are experiencing homelessness
Residents of long-term care facilities
How it spreads
Group A strep bacteria are very contagious. Some people infected with group A strep bacteria don't have symptoms or seem sick. They can still spread the bacteria to others.
Generally, people spread the bacteria to others through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Rarely group A strep bacteria can be spread through food that isn't handled properly.
Respiratory droplets
Group A strep bacteria often live in the nose and throat. People who are infected spread the bacteria by talking, coughing, or sneezing. This creates respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria.
People can get sick if they:
Breathe in respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria
Touch their mouth or nose after touching something with those droplets on it
Use the same plate, utensils, or glass as someone infected with the bacteria
Once washed, plates, utensils, and glasses are safe for others to use.
Direct contact
People can also spread group A strep bacteria from infected sores on the skin. Other people can get sick if they touch those sores or come into contact with fluid from the sores.
Once the sores heal, someone with impetigo usually isn't able to spread the bacteria to others.
Prevention
There are things people can do to protect themselves and others from group A strep infections.
Group A strep prevention activities vary by each disease, but generally focus on three important goals:
Limit exposure and spread of bacteria
Treat group A strep infections promptly
Use preventive antibiotics when appropriate

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and Vaccines
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS |
PAGE 5 OF 9 | ALL PAGES
KEY POINTS
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder where the body’s immune system damages nerve. To study whether a new vaccine might be causing GBS, CDC compares the usual rate of GBS to the observed rate of GBS in vaccinated people.
Overview
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder where the body’s immune system damages nerve. The damage to the nerves causes muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. While its cause is not fully understood, the syndrome often follows infection with a virus or bacteria. Most people fully recover from GBS, but some have permanent nerve damage.
GBS is rare
Each year in the United States, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS.
To study whether a new vaccine might be causing GBS, CDC compares the usual rate of GBS to the observed rate of GBS in vaccinated people. This helps to determine whether a vaccine could be causing more cases.
What the research shows
Influenza (flu) vaccine
In response to a potential pandemic strain of a flu virus in 1976, there was a national campaign for people to get the swine flu vaccination. Over 45 million people were vaccinated and there were increased reports of GBS following vaccination. Those who received the 1976 swine flu vaccine had a slight increased risk for developing GBS of approximately one additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine. Scientists have several theories about the cause, but the exact reason for this link remains unknown.
CDC monitors GBS cases during each flu season. From data collected, the association between seasonal flu vaccine and GBS has been found to vary from season to season. When there has been an increased risk, it has consistently been in the range of 1-2 additional GBS cases per million flu vaccine doses administered.
Additional studies have been conducted on the risk of GBS following flu vaccination. Results of these studies suggest that it is more likely that a person will get GBS after getting the flu than after vaccination. It is important to keep in mind flu infection can potentially cause severe illness and death. The best way to prevent flu infection and its complications is to get the flu vaccine.
Keep Reading:
Guillain-Barré syndrome and Flu Vaccine
COVID-19 vaccine
CDC monitors multiple vaccine safety systems to determine if GBS is occurring more among those who are vaccinated than the general rate of GBS in the population.
Recent CDC studies based on data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) have found evidence suggesting an increased risk of GBS among adults 18 years and older after J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination but not after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. CDC will continue to monitor for and evaluate reports of GBS occurring after COVID-19 vaccination and will share more information as it becomes available.
What CDC is doing
Fact
CDC and FDA closely monitor the safety of all vaccines.
CDC and FDA are committed to monitoring the safety of vaccines. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized by FDA for use in the United States, CDC, FDA, and other federal agencies work together to monitor them using several safety systems.

Guinea Worm Disease
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
PARASITES 
MARCH 14, 2024
About Guinea Worm
KEY POINTS
Guinea worm disease (GWD) is caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis.
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
The disease affects communities in remote parts of Africa that do not have safe water to drink.
There is no treatment nor a vaccine for Guinea worm disease.
Overview
Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease (GWD), is an infection caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. GWD is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) transmitted to people mostly by consuming unsafe water. Unfiltered drinking water from ponds or other stagnant surface water sources can contain near-microscopic crustaceans called copepods (tiny ""water fleas"") that are infected with Guinea worm larvae (immature forms of the Guinea worm).
Signs and symptoms
People do not usually have GWD symptoms until about one year after infection. Then, a mature pregnant female worm full of larvae creates a blister on the skin through which she will emerge and expel her larvae when she comes in contact with water. A few days to hours before the worm, which can measure up to 3 feet (1 meter) in length, comes out of the skin, a person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area. Most worms come out of people's legs and feet, though worms can come out of other body parts, too.
Challenges
People in remote rural communities who have GWD often lack access to healthcare. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very painful, disabling, and take a long time to remove. The emerging worm can cause a wound that may develop a secondary infection.
People at risk
Anyone who consumes drinking water from a pond or other stagnant water source contaminated with infected copepods is at risk for infection. People's risk for disease can vary. People do not get immunity after GWD, which means they can get it again.
GWD transmission also has a seasonal pattern.
How it spreads
Water contact triggers the Guinea worm to release a milky white liquid that contains hundreds of thousands of immature larvae into the water. In ponds and other stagnant water sources, these larvae are then consumed by copepods. People might become infected with Guinea worms by consuming unfiltered drinking water from such water sources containing infected copepods. People and animals might also become infected by eating certain aquatic animals (e.g., fish or frogs) that have swallowed infected copepods. People and animals infected with GWD can then spread the disease when the worm matures and is ready to emerge from the body if they enter ponds and other stagnant water sources that others drink from.
Prevention
Guinea worm is a disease that has been prioritized for eradication by the World Health Organization. There were an estimated 3.5 million Guinea worm cases occurring annually in 20 African and Asian countries in 1986, but today, through the Guinea Worm Eradication Program
(GWEP), only a handful of countries continue to have the disease. GWEP
undertakes several water-related and other measures to prevent GWD:
Surveillance and case containment
Safe water practices, including distribution of cloth and pipe filters to remove copepods, and advocacy for installation or rehabilitation of safe drinking water supplies like borehole wells
Vector control
Health education and community mobilization
Quick facts
There were 14 human GWD cases reported in 2023 in Chad, South Sudan, Mali, Cameroon, and Central African Republic.
There were 714 animal GWD infections reported in 2023, which is a slight increase compared to 2022 following expanded surveillance activities.
WHO has certified 200 countries free from Guinea worm. The six countries that have not yet been certified as free from Guinea worm are Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, South Sudan, and Sudan.
Treatment and recovery
There is no drug to treat Guinea worm infection. Once part of the worm begins to come out of the wound, it is important that all of the worm is removed to prevent complications. Anti-inflammatory medicine can help reduce pain and swelling, and antibiotic ointment can help prevent infections.
Vaccines
There is no vaccine to prevent Guinea worm infection.
