Safe Water for All
Print
Water is the essence of life and human dignity. Sufficient, safe, physically accessible, and affordable water is vital for all. Despite great strides over the last decades, 1.1 billion people living in rural areas and urban slums still rely on unsafe drinking water from rivers, lakes, and open wells. Children suffer greatly from water-related illnesses. Every year, nearly 2 million children die from the consequences of diarrhea and other diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery.
CDC works with many global partners to develop and distribute simple and inexpensive disinfection and filtration systems that make an immediate difference in the lives of the worst affected. On another front: in collaboration with The Carter Center, CDC has worked to develop strategies to eradicate Guinea worm disease from sub-Saharan Africa. This water-borne parasitic disease is about to be conquered—a global public health achievement.
The CDC Safe Water System
The CDC Safe Water System is a very simple solution to a very big problem. In response to a 1991 cholera epidemic in Peru, CDC scientists designed a way for families to treat unsafe water. A diluted hypochlorite (bleach) solution was used to treat water in specially designed vessels to protect the treated water from recontamination during transport, storage, and handling in the household. The solution and water vessels both had to be products that families would be willing to use, and education to improve hygiene and water handling practices was critical.
Promising pilot studies in Bolivia led to partnerships with Proctor & Gamble and Population Services International, a non-governmental organization. In 1996, the first national Safe Water System program-called CLARO was launched in Bolivia. CDC Safe Water System programs are now running in 24 countries around the world — from Afghanistan to Zambia. Partners range from international organizations such as UNICEF to local non-governmental agencies to Ministries of Water and Education to manufacturers, both local and multinational.
Jerry Cans: Improving Water Transport & Storage
In many developing countries in Africa and South America, people re-purpose 20-liter (5-gallon) jerry cans, initially used for cooking oil, to transport and store water. They are easy to carry on the head and are a good option for safe water storage. The opening is too small to allow hands or utensils into the water, so the water is poured out without contamination. The jerry cans can also be modified by drilling a hole in the plastic and adding a tap to provide water that has been treated for drinking or handwashing.
Based on the popularity of jerry cans, CDC worked with Proctor & Gamble to design what is known internationally as the “CDC SWS Modified Jerry Can.” On display is the original cream-colored prototype, which includes indentations on the flat sides so that the container can be carried more comfortably on the head. The green and blue examples are from Bolivia and Guatemala.
  Safe Water Vessels
CDC works with SWAP, a non-governmental agency based in Kisimu, Kenya, to provide HIV support groups, opportunities to promote and sell water treatment and other health products, and to provide HIV services. Other initiatives integrate safe water programs with infant care and immunization programs as incentives for mothers to come in for care, and to begin adopting healthy behaviors.
Haitian SWS Buckets
When Haiti was struck by a massive earthquake in 2010, Safe Water System programs and other point-of-use treatments had been in use in Haiti for over 15 years. Five-gallon plastic buckets adapted with spigots, like the one on display here, were already the most-used Haitian water storage containers. These buckets and solutions are examples of products distributed immediately after the earthquake by CDC and other partners. Late in 2010, when Haiti experienced its first cholera epidemic, these products were widely distributed to affected populations.
Sustaining Safe Water System (SWS) Programs
CDC’s goal is to promote sustainable, long-term drinking water programs that will help prevent disease and improve health. Long-term programs require many partners (both governmental and non-governmental), community will, and long-term strategies for how to manufacture and distribute SWS products. Some of the most successful programs in countries such as Bolivia and Kenya contribute significantly to local economies by providing jobs to health educators, distributors, and manufacturers.
To encourage communities to treat household drinking water through the Safe Water System, health educators draw upon various behavior change techniques, including social marketing, community mobilization, health education, and promotion. Organized community-by-community, education campaigns show the link between contaminated water and disease, as well as the benefits of safe water and hygienic behaviors. Because fecal contamination from poor sanitation practices and unwashed hands and foods can spread disease, these campaigns also promote hand-washing and proper latrine use.
The Safe Water System (SWS) works best in communities where families have enough water for their daily needs. Each community faces different challenges. It is critical to understand the sources of water; how it is collected, transported, and stored; as well as local sanitation, cultural, and economic practices. Successful programs start with community will and buy-in, often coupled with technical and financial assistance from governments, non-governmental agencies, and industries.
For a Safe Water System (SWS) to have a health impact, households must obtain and correctly use the disinfectant on an ongoing basis. Although there is significant debate about pricing of health products for people in developing countries, it is generally accepted that users who pay something for a product—even a minimal amount—are more likely to value the product, use it correctly, and continue to use it.
Social marketing uses commercial marketing methods, such as branding and consumer research, to increase the acceptability of a product to meet a social need. Products are subsidized to some degree depending upon the capacity of a community or country and the amount of donor support available. Many SWS projects have used social marketing strategies, including advertising, community events such as parades and skits, and T-shirt giveaways.
The Fiery Serpent: Guinea Worm Disease
People living in poor, remote rural areas without safe water have long suffered the burning pain of Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis), caused by the “fiery serpent,” Dracunculus medinensis. There is no drug treatment or vaccine to prevent it. People become infected with Guinea worm when they drink water containing copepods (water fleas) that have eaten Guinea worm larvae. The worms mature and grow inside the human body—some as long as 3 feet. After a year, the female worm slowly emerges through painful blisters in the skin. People seeking relief from the burning sensation caused by the emerging Guinea worm immerse their affected limbs in drinking water sources. This stimulates the worm to release larvae into the water, and the contamination cycle begins again.
Using simple filters, treating contaminated water sources, and digging safe wells can prevent the disease. A global partnership of public, private, and governmental organizations has set the goal of making Guinea worm disease disappear from the planet.
In 1986, about 3.5 million persons in at least 21 countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East had the disease. Today, the number of cases is down to only a few per year in a few African countries.

Blood Safety Basics
KEY POINTS
Each day, life-saving blood transfusions are needed across the United States.
Most patients do not experience side effects from transfusions. On rare occasions, transfusions can cause adverse reactions in patients receiving blood.
Although the U.S. blood supply is safer than ever, some bacteria, viruses, etc. can infect blood transfusion recipients.
All blood donors and blood donations are screened for infections and diseases.
Overview
The U.S. blood supply is safer than it has ever been. However, blood transfusions can transmit any bloodborne pathogen.
Report a Possible Outbreak
To report a possible transfusion-transmitted infection cluster or outbreak.
Call: 770-488-7100
E-mail: haioutbreak@cdc.gov
Complications
Several types of bacteria, viruses, parasites and prions can infect blood donors and recipients, though these infections are rare. Adverse reactions (e.g., allergic reaction, transfusion-transmitted infection, etc.) to a blood transfusion are also very rare. The most common adverse reactions from blood transfusions are allergic and febrile reactions, which make up over half of all adverse reactions reported.
Reducing Risk
Screening donated blood
Healthcare providers and blood banks ask donors a set of standard questions before donating blood including:
Whether or not they are in good health
Their social behavior and health history
If they are free of any bacterial, viral or parasitic diseases
If they have traveled to areas where transmittable diseases are common
If their answers indicate they are not well or are at risk for having a disease transmissible by blood transfusion, they cannot donate blood.
Testing donated blood
Once donated, laboratory technicians test for blood type, certain infectious diseases and additional proteins (or antibodies) that may cause adverse reactions in a person receiving a blood transfusion.
Keep Reading:
Clinical Testing Guidance for Blood Safety
Quick Facts
There are approximately 7 million blood donors and more than 14 million units of blood transfused annually in the United States.
Every 2 seconds someone in the United States needs blood and or platelets.
The U.S. healthcare system needs approximately 29,000 units of red blood cells every day.
The U.S. healthcare system needs nearly 5,000 units of platelets and 6.500 units of plasma per day.
What CDC is doing
The CDC's Office of Blood, Organ and Other Tissue Safety (BOOTS) conducts surveillance for adverse events following blood transfusions. Providers can use this information to prevent transfusion-related events through evidence-based interventions and recommendations. Hospitals provide this information voluntarily.
Assisting state and local health departments and hospitals in investigating reports of potential infectious disease transmission.
Collecting and monitoring data on blood safety and adverse reactions in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hemovigilance Module since 2010. By collecting data in a national system, CDC analyzes aggregate data to understand how to prevent transfusion-related adverse events.
Conducting surveillance for blood utilization through the National Blood Collection & Utilization Survey.

Medication Safety and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement.
An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat.
ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.
Why it's important
The number of ADEs can increase due to:
Development and use of new medicines.
Discovery of new uses for older medicines.
The aging American population.
Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.
Learning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.
More than 1.5 million emergency visits
Each year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.
Tips
Practice medication safety at home
Adults
Keep a list
Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements.
Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.
Follow label directions
Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.
Take medicine on time
Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime).
Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.
Turn a light on
Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake.
If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.
Ask questions
If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.
Get the tests you need
Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.
Children
Know the dose.
Always:
Read the label.
Follow directions.
Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.
Check the label
Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines.
Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient.
If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Use the right tool
If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one.
Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.
Get questions answered
If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.
Teach children
Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.
Lock the safety cap
Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.
Put medicines away
After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location.
Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.
What CDC is doing
Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies.
Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups.
Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.

About Sodium and Health
KEY POINTS
Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium is bad for your health.
While sodium has many forms, most sodium we consume is from salt.
Most Americans consume too much sodium.
Most sodium comes from processed and restaurant foods.
Health risks
Eating too much sodium can increase your blood pressure and your risk for heart disease and stroke. Together, heart disease and stroke kill more Americans each year than any other cause.
Keep Reading:
Tips for Reducing Sodium Intake
Most people eat too much sodium
Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium is bad for your health. Americans consume more than 3,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, on average. This is well above the federal recommendation
of less than 2,300 mg of sodium daily for teens and adults as part of a healthy eating pattern.
Sodium in everyday foods adds up
Sodium is found in foods from almost all food categories. Some of the top sources of sodium for U.S. adults and children ages 1 and older include:
Sandwiches.
Rice, pasta, and other grain-based dishes.
Starchy and non-starchy vegetables.
Meat, poultry, and seafood dishes.
Pizza.
Soups.
Chips, crackers, and savory snacks.
Desserts and sweet snacks.
Condiments and gravies.
Cold cuts and cured meats.
Breads and tortillas.
Source: Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025
Sodium or salt?
Salt and sodium are not the same. Salt is sodium chloride which is table salt. Sodium chloride is 40% sodium and 60% chloride. One teaspoon of table salt contains about 2,400 mg of sodium.
Sodium is a mineral found in many ingredients in common foods:
Monosodium glutamate (MSG).
Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).
Sodium nitrate (a preservative).

Global Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
KEY POINTS
Global access to safe water, sanitation, and proper hygiene education can reduce illness and death from disease, improve health, reduce poverty, and help economic growth.
Every year, diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid fever cause millions of illnesses and deaths, yet they can be prevented with better WASH practices.
Overview
Everyone needs clean water, safe toilets, and good hygiene habits to stay healthy, but not everyone has access to these essentials. Today, millions of people around the world do not have clean water to drink, and billions do not have a safe place to go to the bathroom. This can lead to serious illnesses like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, which are especially dangerous for infants and children.
Access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene remains a significant global challenge, with over 2 billion people
lacking clean drinking water at home, 1.5 billion lacking basic sanitation facilities, and 2 billion lacking basic hygiene services
.
Universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene has the potential to greatly reduce global disease burden. Investing in water and sanitation interventions brings economic, environmental, quality of life, and health benefits. WASH also plays a key role in improving nutritional outcomes, particularly among children.
Global impact of waterborne infections
Unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene play a major role in spreading diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. These conditions also contribute to the emergence of more dangerous forms of diseases, such as extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever. Addressing these challenges requires dedicated efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices. These improvements are necessary for preventing the spread of disease and dealing with emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant infections.
Harmful germs, parasites, or toxic chemicals can contaminate water. This contaminated water comes from human or animal waste, pesticides, and industrial waste. This can make people sick with diseases like cholera, typhoid, polio, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five years old. The primary risk factors for diarrhea include unsafe water and sanitation, along with childhood malnutrition.
In addition, not having access to clean water, toilets, and good hygiene practices makes it harder to stop and manage neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis, trachoma, and Guinea worm disease. This keeps the cycle of poverty and sickness going. Having reliable access to safe water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices significantly reduces the burden of disease globally.
Key facts highlight the impact of these conditions:
Diarrhea is a major cause of mortality among children under five, with about 88% of these deaths attributable to WASH issues.
Cholera affects 47 countries, primarily impacting vulnerable populations, with efforts focusing on improving WASH and vaccination to prevent outbreaks.
Typhoid fever, notably its drug-resistant strains, underscores the importance of enhanced sanitation, hygiene, and vaccination efforts for prevention.
Improving WASH infrastructure and practices is key to breaking the cycle of disease and poverty and highlights the need for global efforts to ensure everyone has access to safe water and sanitation.

About Sarcocystosis
KEY POINTS
Sarcocystosis is a disease caused by the parasite Sarcocystis.
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
Sarcocystosis occurs in tropical or subtropical areas.
The disease usually affects animals, but humans can get two types of sarcocystosis.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Sarcocystosis is a parasitic disease caused by the parasite Sarcocystis. There are different species of Sarcocystis.
Although sarcocystosis usually affects animals, there are two types that affect humans:
Intestinal type (caused by S. hominis and S. suihominis)
Muscular type (caused by animal Sarcocystis species)
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Sarcocystosis page.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms differ based on the type of sarcocystosis. Most people infected with Sarcocystis do not have symptoms. Symptoms can include one or more of the following based on the type of sarcocystosis:
Intestinal type:
Diarrhea
Mild fever
Vomiting
Muscular type:
Muscle pain
Edema (swelling from too much fluid in the body's tissue. Tissue are parts of the body underneath the skin).
Fever
At-risk populations
Sarcocystosis occurs in tropical and subtropical regions. Muscular sarcocystosis occurs most often in countries in Southeast Asia.
Causes
People can get infected in different ways based on the type of sarcocystosis.
In the intestinal type, people get infected by eating undercooked meat containing the parasite.
In the muscular type, eating food or water contaminated with the parasite is a risk factor. An animal will defecate (poop) a form of the parasite out, which can then contaminate food or water that people may drink.
Prevention
Take precautions when consuming food and water and practice good sanitation methods while traveling to areas where sarcocystosis occurs.
Food and water precautions
Water
Use bottled water with unbroken seals.
Boil water for at least one minute or use filtered water.
Water purification tablets and chlorine products may not kill Sarcocystis.
Use safe water (sanitized water, such as bottled, boiled, or filtered water) to brush your teeth, wash and prepare food, and make ice.
Clean areas where you prep food and kitchen items with soap and safe water. The items should be completely dry before reusing them.
Store water in a clean, covered container.
In areas where sarcocystosis occurs, do not:
Use piped water sources that may be contaminated.
Drink beverages sold in cups or bags or use ice if you are not sure if the ice was made with safe water.
Swim in fresh water that may be contaminated.
See more on Healthy Water
Using safe water is important to protect yourself from infection. Avoid the following activities due to the risk of contamination:
Using piped water sources.
Drinking beverages sold in cups or bags.
Using ice if you are not sure if the ice is made from safe water.
Swimming in fresh water.
Cooking food
Cook all meat, including wild game meat (ground and whole cuts, excluding poultry) to 160° Fahrenheit or 71° Celsius (especially pork and beef). Use a meat thermometer to determine that the meat has reached a safe minimum internal temperature. Cook poultry – whole cuts and ground — to 165° F (74° C).
See more on Safe Food Handling
Cleanliness precautions
Handwashing
Wash your hands with soap and safe water. If you do not have soap, use an alcohol-based (60%) hand cleaner.
Wash your hands before you eat or prepare food, before feeding children, after using the toilet, after cleaning your child's bottom, and after taking care of someone who has diarrhea.
See more on Handwashing
Toilets
Use toilets or other sanitation systems (e.g., chemical toilets)
Clean toilets and surfaces contaminated with feces (poop). Use a solution of one part bleach to nine parts water.
Do not poop near any body of water.
Household sanitation
Clean areas where you eat or wash yourself.
Wash yourself, your children, diapers, and clothes at least 100 feet (about 30 meters) away from drinking water sources.
Diagnosis
If you think you have sarcocystosis, see a healthcare provider.
For intestinal sarcocystosis (S. hominis and S. suihominis), a healthcare provider can use a microscope to identify the parasites in stool (poop) specimens.
For muscular sarcocystosis, a healthcare provider will identify parasites in tissue samples.
Treatment and recovery
Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you have intestinal or muscular sarcocystosis.

About Scabies
KEY POINTS
Scabies is an infestation of the skin by a human itch mite.
Scabies causes intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash.
Human scabies is most commonly spread by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies.
Anyone can get scabies.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Scabies is caused by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis). The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs. Scabies can spread quickly under crowded conditions where close body and skin contact is frequent.
The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash.
Signs and symptoms
The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching, especially at night, and a pimple-like skin rash. Common areas on body where symptoms occur include:
between fingers,
in the skin folds of the wrist, elbow, knee, or armpit, and
on the penis, nipples, waist, buttocks, and shoulder blades.
You may see tiny burrows on the skin, caused by the female mite tunneling just beneath the surface of the skin.
Infants and very young children often experience a rash on the head, face, neck, palms, and soles of the feet.
Crusted scabies
Crusted scabies is a severe form of scabies that is very contagious. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of crusted scabies can often cause outbreaks.
Risk factors
Scabies is a common condition found worldwide. It can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact. Scabies can spread easily under crowded conditions where close body and skin contact is frequent.
Places where scabies outbreaks more commonly occur include:
Nursing homes
Extended care facilities
Detention facilities including jails and prisons
Childcare facilities
How it spreads
You can get scabies by
Direct, extended, skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies or
Less commonly, sharing clothing, towels, or bedding used by an infected person.
Homeless shelters or encampments.
Prevention
When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms typically take 4 – 8 weeks to develop. However, a person with an infestation can transmit scabies even if they do not have symptoms.
To prevent scabies, avoid direct skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. Avoid sharing items such as clothing or bedding used by a person who has scabies.
Control
To control the spread of scabies, treat all household members and close contacts at the same time as the person with scabies. This should help to prevent possible re-exposure and reinfestation. Wash all clothing, towels, and bedding used next to the skin during the three days before starting treatment. Items should be machine washed using hot water (temperatures in excess of 50°C or 122°F for 10 minutes will kill mites and eggs), dried on the hot cycle, or dry-cleaned. Seal items you can't wash or dry-clean in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than two to three days away from human skin. Children and adults can usually return to childcare, school, or work the day after treatment.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare professional can sometimes diagnose scabies based on physical exam findings and history but will likely try to confirm scabies by finding the mite, mite eggs, or feces (scybala). They may scrape your skin or use the tip of a needle to carefully remove the mite from the end of its burrow. The sample is examined under a microscope to confirm scabies.
A person can still have scabies even if mites, eggs, or feces are not found. Fewer than 10 – 15 mites may be present on an infected person who is otherwise healthy.
Treatment and recovery
The first time a person gets scabies they usually have no symptoms at the beginning. Symptoms can take four to eight weeks to develop after infestation; however, people can still spread scabies during this time.
If you suspect you have scabies, seek medical attention. Your healthcare professional can prescribe a cream, lotion, or pill that kills scabies mites.
To prevent the spread of scabies
Treat other household members with whom you have had direct skin contact or have shared a bed, towels, or clothing at the same time.
Wash bedding, clothing, and towels in hot water and dry in a hot dryer. Temperatures in excess of 50°C or 122°F for 10 minutes will kill mites and eggs.
Dry-clean items that can’t be washed or seal them in a closed plastic bag for at least 72 hours to a week.
Avoid skin-to-skin contact with others until treatment is complete.
Notify people you had direct skin-to-skin contact with during the previous two months and encourage them to seek treatment.
Scabies mites generally do not survive more than two to three days away from human skin.
Products used to treat scabies (scabicides) kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides require a doctor's prescription. No non-prescription products have been tested and approved to treat scabies. Carefully follow the instructions contained in the box or on the label. Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. For infants and children, the lotion or cream should be applied to their entire head and neck as well as the rest of the body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off.
The itching of scabies is due to a hypersensitivity reaction (allergy) to mites and their feces, so itching may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed. However, if itching still is present two to four weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash appear, retreatment may be necessary.

Sarin
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Sarin is a human-made chemical warfare nerve agent.
Signs and symptoms of sarin exposure depend on how much you were exposed to and how you were exposed.
If exposed, get away from the area, get clean, and get help.
Background
Sarin, known as ""GB"" to the military, is a human-made chemical warfare nerve agent. It is one of the most toxic and fast acting nerve agents. Nerve agents stop certain enzymes from working. When this enzyme does not work correctly, muscles are constantly being used. As a result, people may become tired and no longer be able to keep breathing.
Sarin is a clear, colorless, tasteless liquid with no smell. Sarin can evaporate into a vapor (gas) and spread into the environment.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms depend on the amount of sarin, how the person was exposed, and for how long. Sarin has no smell, so people may not know they were exposed until signs and symptoms develop.
Exposure to a low or medium amount may cause some or all of these signs and symptoms within seconds to hours:
Abnormally low or high blood pressure
Blurry vision
Chest tightness
Confusion
Cough
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain
Drooling
Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and/or wheezing
Drowsiness
Eye pain and/or tearing
Excessive sweating
Headache
Increased urination
Muscle cramps
Rapid breathing
Runny nose
Slow or fast heart rate
Small, pinpoint pupils
Tremors
Weakness
Even a small drop of sarin on the skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching where it touched the skin.
Exposure to large doses of sarin by any type of exposure would likely cause the following harmful health effects:
Loss of consciousness
Cardiac arrest possibly leading to death
Coma
Convulsions
Paralysis
Respiratory failure possibly leading to death
Seizures
Twitching
Exposure
Air
If sarin is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the sarin gas. Because sarin vapor is heavier than air, it will sink to low-lying areas and increase the risk of exposure there.
Food
Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with sarin can expose people to sarin. Avoid using or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched sarin if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by sarin. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Water
If sarin is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the water. Sarin mixes easily with water, which helps it spread.
People can also be exposed to liquid sarin by swallowing it, getting it on their skin, or in their eyes. People can also touch or breathe in sarin gas from clothes that has been exposed to sarin.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
What to do if you are exposed
When immediate care is needed
If someone has swallowed sarin, do not force vomiting.
Get away
Get away from the area where the sarin was released and breathe fresh air.
If the sarin release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the sarin does not come inside.
If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the sarin was released. If you cannot get away from the area, go to the highest ground possible. Sarin is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas.
If the sarin release was indoors, get out of the building.

Responding to Chemical Emergencies
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. This is the best way to remove sarin from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take your clothes off
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the sarin from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
Follow these steps to blot your body:
Use dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Use a different cloth or towel for each body part.
Start blotting with your head and hair.
Then blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with a lot of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds. Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch sarin. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.

About Getting Clean
Get help
Call 911, go to the hospital (if local officials say it is safe to leave), or call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.

Check the radio, television, mobile news app, or text message alerts for more information.
Treatment
Treatment involves removing sarin from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Care can be given in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel.
Antidotes (cures) for sarin are available in a healthcare setting. They are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.
Long-term health effects
Sarin breaks down slowly in the body. As a result, repeated exposures to sarin or other nerve agents can build up in the body.
People who were exposed to low amounts usually recover. People who were exposed to higher amounts may experience long-lasting symptoms, including:
Muscle weakness
Paralysis
Pain
Pins and needles sensations
People who received very high doses are less likely to survive.

About Scabies
KEY POINTS
Scabies is an infestation of the skin by a human itch mite.
Scabies causes intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash.
Human scabies is most commonly spread by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies.
Anyone can get scabies.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Scabies is caused by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis). The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs. Scabies can spread quickly under crowded conditions where close body and skin contact is frequent.
The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash.
Signs and symptoms
The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching, especially at night, and a pimple-like skin rash. Common areas on body where symptoms occur include:
between fingers,
in the skin folds of the wrist, elbow, knee, or armpit, and
on the penis, nipples, waist, buttocks, and shoulder blades.
You may see tiny burrows on the skin, caused by the female mite tunneling just beneath the surface of the skin.
Infants and very young children often experience a rash on the head, face, neck, palms, and soles of the feet.
Crusted scabies
Crusted scabies is a severe form of scabies that is very contagious. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of crusted scabies can often cause outbreaks.
Risk factors
Scabies is a common condition found worldwide. It can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact. Scabies can spread easily under crowded conditions where close body and skin contact is frequent.
Places where scabies outbreaks more commonly occur include:
Nursing homes
Extended care facilities
Detention facilities including jails and prisons
Childcare facilities
How it spreads
You can get scabies by
Direct, extended, skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies or
Less commonly, sharing clothing, towels, or bedding used by an infected person.
Homeless shelters or encampments.
Prevention
When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms typically take 4 – 8 weeks to develop. However, a person with an infestation can transmit scabies even if they do not have symptoms.
To prevent scabies, avoid direct skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. Avoid sharing items such as clothing or bedding used by a person who has scabies.
Control
To control the spread of scabies, treat all household members and close contacts at the same time as the person with scabies. This should help to prevent possible re-exposure and reinfestation. Wash all clothing, towels, and bedding used next to the skin during the three days before starting treatment. Items should be machine washed using hot water (temperatures in excess of 50°C or 122°F for 10 minutes will kill mites and eggs), dried on the hot cycle, or dry-cleaned. Seal items you can't wash or dry-clean in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than two to three days away from human skin. Children and adults can usually return to childcare, school, or work the day after treatment.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare professional can sometimes diagnose scabies based on physical exam findings and history but will likely try to confirm scabies by finding the mite, mite eggs, or feces (scybala). They may scrape your skin or use the tip of a needle to carefully remove the mite from the end of its burrow. The sample is examined under a microscope to confirm scabies.
A person can still have scabies even if mites, eggs, or feces are not found. Fewer than 10 – 15 mites may be present on an infected person who is otherwise healthy.
Treatment and recovery
The first time a person gets scabies they usually have no symptoms at the beginning. Symptoms can take four to eight weeks to develop after infestation; however, people can still spread scabies during this time.
If you suspect you have scabies, seek medical attention. Your healthcare professional can prescribe a cream, lotion, or pill that kills scabies mites.
To prevent the spread of scabies
Treat other household members with whom you have had direct skin contact or have shared a bed, towels, or clothing at the same time.
Wash bedding, clothing, and towels in hot water and dry in a hot dryer. Temperatures in excess of 50°C or 122°F for 10 minutes will kill mites and eggs.
Dry-clean items that can’t be washed or seal them in a closed plastic bag for at least 72 hours to a week.
Avoid skin-to-skin contact with others until treatment is complete.
Notify people you had direct skin-to-skin contact with during the previous two months and encourage them to seek treatment.
Scabies mites generally do not survive more than two to three days away from human skin.
Products used to treat scabies (scabicides) kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides require a doctor's prescription. No non-prescription products have been tested and approved to treat scabies. Carefully follow the instructions contained in the box or on the label. Scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. For infants and children, the lotion or cream should be applied to their entire head and neck as well as the rest of the body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off.
The itching of scabies is due to a hypersensitivity reaction (allergy) to mites and their feces, so itching may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed. However, if itching still is present two to four weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash appear, retreatment may be necessary.

APRIL 19, 2024
About School Violence
KEY POINTS
School is the location where the violence occurs, not a type of violence.
Prevention efforts by teachers, administrators, parents, community members, and students can reduce violence and improve the school environment.
What is school violence?
School violence is violence that occurs in the school setting, such as on school property or on the way to or from school, or during a school-sponsored event or on the way to or from a school-sponsored event. It describes violent acts that disrupt learning and have a negative effect on students, schools, and the broader community.
Examples of school violence include:
Bullying and cyberbullying.
Fighting (e.g., punching, slapping, kicking).
Weapon use.
Gang violence.
Sexual violence.
Quick facts and stats
In 2019, CDC's nationwide Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was administered to high school students across the United States. According to YRBS results from 13,677 students:
About one in five high school students reported being bullied on school property in the last year.
8% of high school students had been in a physical fight on school property one or more times during the 12 months before the survey.
More than 7% of high school students had been threatened or injured with a weapon (e.g., a gun, knife, or club) on school property one or more times during the 12 months before the survey.
Almost 9% of high school students had not gone to school at least one day during the 30 days before the survey because they felt they would be unsafe at school or on their way to or from school.
Prevention
All students have the right to learn in a safe school environment. The good news is school violence can be prevented. Many factors contribute to school violence. Preventing school violence requires addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence. Research shows that prevention efforts by teachers, administrators, parents, community members, and even students can reduce violence and improve the school environment.
CDC developed Prevention Resources for Action, formerly known as ""technical packages,"" to help communities and states prioritize prevention strategies based on the best available evidence. The strategies and approaches in the Resources for Action are intended to shape individual behaviors as well as the relationship, family, school, community, and societal factors that influence risk and protective factors for violence. They are meant to work together and to be used in combination in a multi-level, multi-sector effort to prevent violence.

JANUARY 15, 2025
Clinical Screening and Diagnosis for Critical Congenital Heart Defects
KEY POINTS
Screening for critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) can help identify some babies with a CCHD before they go home from the birth hospital.
Screening allows babies to be treated early and may prevent disability or death early in life.
Importance of screening
Newborn screening may identify critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) before signs are evident. Identifying newborns with these conditions before hospital discharge can help ensure they receive prompt care and treatment. Timely care may prevent disability or death early in life.
Screening has prevented early infant death
Mandated CCHD screening using pulse oximetry reduces early infant deaths from CCHD by 33%, or 120 early infant deaths from CCHD averted per year.
Screening guidelines
Current recommendations focus on screening healthy-appearing newborns in:
Newborn nurseries
Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or other settings after the child has been weaned off supplemental oxygen
Screening is done when a baby is at least 24 hours of age or as late as possible if the baby is to be discharged before 24 hours of age. Timing the screening around the time of the newborn hearing screening can help improve efficiency. A pulse oximeter is used to measure the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is saturated with oxygen.
The following is the recommended algorithm, for newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry (Oster et al., 2024
)
View LargerDownload
NOTE: Percentages refer to O2 saturation as measured by pulse oximeter
Pulse oximetry screening should not replace taking a complete family health history, pregnancy history, or physical examination. These exams may detect CCHDs before the development of low oxygen levels (hypoxemia) in the blood. Screening with pulse oximetry identifies several types of CCHDs, the most common are below.
Screening targets
Screening with pulse oximetry can identify a number of types of CCHDs, the most common of which are shown below. While not the main targets of screening, many conditions other than CCHDs may present with hypoxemia. As a result, such conditions may also be detected via pulse oximetry.
Critical Congenital Heart Defects
Coarctation of the aorta and Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
Double outlet right ventricle, Ebstein anomaly, and Single ventricle
Interrupted aortic arch and Tetralogy of Fallot
Pulmonary atresia and Total anomalous pulmonary venous return
d-Transposition of the great arteries
Tricuspid artresia and Truncus ateriosus
Other critical defects not otherwise specified
Other conditions that are not CCHDs
Hemoglobinopathy
Hypothermia
Infection, including sepsis
Lung disease (congenital or acquired)
Non-critical congenital heart defect
Persistent pulmonary hypertension
Other hypoxic conditions not otherwise specified
Screening outcomes
Failed screens
A screen is considered failed if at least one of these occur:
Any oxygen (O2) saturation measure is <90% in either the right hand or foot (initial screen/repeat screen)
O2 saturation is <95% in BOTH the right hand and foot on 2 measures*
A >3% difference in O2 saturation in the right hand and foot on 2 measures*
*Each separated by one hour
Any infant who fails the screen should have an evaluation for causes of hypoxemia. In most cases this will include an echocardiogram. If a reversible cause of hypoxemia is identified and appropriately treated, an echocardiogram may not be necessary. The infant's pediatrician should be notified immediately and the infant might need to be seen by a cardiologist.
Passed screens
A screen is considered passed when there is an oxygen saturation measure that is:
≥95% in BOTH the right hand and foot
≤3% absolute difference between the right hand and foot
When the above conditions are met, screening would end. Pulse oximetry screening does not detect all CCHDs. Therefore, it is possible for a baby with a passing screening result to still have a CCHD or other congenital heart defect.
Ways to reduce false positive screens
Screen the newborn while he or she is alert.
Screen the newborn when he or she is at least 24 hours old.
Screen the newborn after he or she has been weaned off supplemental O2.

AT A GLANCE
Typhus fevers are a group of diseases caused by bacteria that are spread to humans by fleas, lice, and chiggers.
Typhus fevers include murine typhus, epidemic typhus and scrub typhus.
Fleas spread murine typhus, body lice spread epidemic typhus, and chiggers spread scrub typhus.
The most common symptoms are fever, headaches, and sometimes rash.
Overview
Murine Typhus
Murine typhus, also called flea-borne typhus is a disease caused by the bacteria Rickettsia typhi. Murine typhus is spread to people through contact with infected fleas, most commonly the Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopsis) and the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis).

Seat Belts
KEY POINTS
Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death among those aged 1-54 in the United States.
Seat belt use is the most effective way to save lives and reduce injuries in motor vehicle crashes.
Overview
Buckling up reduces injuries and saves lives
Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death among those aged 1-54 in the United States, and most people who are killed in crashes are passenger vehicle occupants (drivers and passengers). Of the 45,404 people killed in crashes in 2021,1 about 27,242 (or 60%) of these were passenger vehicle occupants.2 Passenger vehicles include cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), pickup trucks, and vans. For adults and older children (who are big enough for seat belts to fit properly), seat belt use is the most effective way to save lives and reduce injuries in crashes. Yet millions do not buckle up on every trip.
Seat belt use in action
Rural & Urban Differences
In the United States, living in rural areas is associated with higher crash-related death rates for drivers and passengers, a higher percentage of deaths among those not buckled up at the time of the crash, and lower seat belt use in adults.
Read the MMWR
Adult Seat Belt Use
Seat belt use has become the national norm, but rates of seat belt use vary widely from state to state. State rates of observed seat belt use ranged from 76% to 97% in 2022.3
Read the Report
Seat Belt Use in Front and Back Seats
Buckle Up – Every Seat, Every Trip. Seat belt use is significantly higher for people riding in the front passenger seat than for people riding in the back seats (92% and 76%, respectively, in 2022 for adults aged 25-69).4 Similarly, beliefs in the importance of seat belt use are higher for the front seat than the rear seat.

About Secondhand Smoke
AT A GLANCE
Exposure to secondhand smoke from burning tobacco products causes disease and premature death among people who do not smoke.
There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Even brief exposure can cause immediate harm.
Comprehensive smokefree laws are laws that prohibit smoking in all workplaces and public places, including restaurants and bars.
Comprehensive smokefree laws and policies fully protect people from secondhand smoke exposure.
Key points
Secondhand smoke is smoke from burning tobacco products, like cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, or pipes.123
Secondhand smoke exposure occurs when people breathe in smoke breathed out by people who smoke or from burning tobacco products.
There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Even brief exposure can cause serious health problems and be deadly.
Completely eliminating smoking is the only way to fully protect people who do not smoke from secondhand smoke exposure.4
Secondhand smoke is harmful
Commercial tobacco smoke contains hundreds of harmful chemicals.A There are more than 7,000 chemicals in commercial tobacco smoke, including hundreds of chemicals that are toxic and about 70 that can cause cancer.156
Here are just a few of the chemicals and toxins in commercial tobacco smoke:
Chemicals and toxins in commercial tobacco smoke.
There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke.4 Even brief exposure can cause serious health problems.145 Secondhand smoke can cause coronary heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer in adults who do not smoke.14 Infants and young children are especially impacted by health problems caused by secondhand smoke because their bodies are still growing. Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for:14
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
Acute respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis
Middle ear disease
More frequent and severe asthma
Respiratory symptoms
Slowed lung growth.
Most people are exposed to secondhand smoke in homes and at work
Most people are exposed to secondhand smoke in their homes or their places of work. People may also be exposed to secondhand smoke in public places like bars, restaurants, and casinos.145
People are more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke if they live in multi-unit housing—like apartment buildings with many homes next to one another in the same place.78 Even when no one in the home smokes, secondhand smoke can drift from other units including through hallways, stairwells, and ventilation systems.8
Protecting people from secondhand smoke exposure
The harm caused by secondhand smoke is preventable. Eliminating smoking is the only way to fully protect people from secondhand smoke exposure.
Comprehensive smokefree laws and policies that prohibit smoking in all areas of indoor spaces are the only way to fully protect people who do not smoke from secondhand smoke exposure.4 Comprehensive smokefree laws and policies can also help people quit smoking and can help keep young people from starting to smoke.4910 These laws and policies must be applied equitably to ensure that all people have a fair and just opportunity to breathe smokefree air and be as healthy as possible.
Most comprehensive smokefree laws and policies also prohibit the use of e-cigarettes. The e-cigarette aerosol that people who use e-cigarettes breathe from the device and exhale can contain harmful and potentially harmful substances.11
Including e-cigarettes in smokefree or tobacco-free policies can protect people who do not use e-cigarettes from exposure to e-cigarette emissions. It can also help change social norms about tobacco use.
More information about e-cigarettes can be found on the Electronic cigarettes webpage.

APRIL 9, 2024
About Sex Trafficking
KEY POINTS
Sex trafficking exploits people of all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, citizenship statuses, and income levels.
Learn to recognize the signs of sex trafficking, prevention opportunities, and know where to get help.
What is sex trafficking?
Sex trafficking is a type of human trafficking
and is a form of modern-day slavery. It is a serious public health problem that negatively affects the well-being of individuals, families, and communities. Human trafficking occurs when a trafficker exploits an individual with force, fraud, or coercion to perform commercial sex acts or work.
Sex trafficking is defined by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000
as ""the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act."" It involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to make an adult engage in commercial sex acts. However, any commercial sexual activity with a minor, even without force, fraud, or coercion, is considered trafficking.
This type of violence exploits women, men, and children across the United States and around the world. Trafficking victimization and perpetration share risks and consequences associated with child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and youth violence.
People at increased risk
Perpetrators often target people experiencing poverty, living in an unsafe situation, or searching for a better life. Victims can come from all backgrounds and become trapped in different locations and situations.
Many victims are women and girls, though men and boys are also impacted. Victims include all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, citizens, non-citizens, and income levels. Victims are trapped and controlled through assault, threats, false promises, perceived sense of protection, isolation, shaming, and debt. Victims do not have to be physically transported between locations to be victimized.
The consequences of sex trafficking are similar to the consequences of sexual violence. Consequences can be immediate and long-term including physical and relationship problems, psychological concerns, and negative chronic health outcomes. Read more about common issues seen in victims of trafficking
.
Prevention
Sex trafficking is preventable. Many prevention and response efforts are focused on increasing community awareness of human trafficking and addressing exploitation after it occurs. To prevent trafficking from occurring, more research is needed to evaluate programs and policies that reduce factors that put people at risk.
Understanding the shared risk and protective factors for violence can help us prevent trafficking from happening in the first place. Strategies based on the best available evidence exist to prevent related forms of violence, and they may also reduce sex trafficking. Read more about HHS' National Human Trafficking Prevention Framework
, which outlines a public health approach to preventing human trafficking.
States and communities can implement and evaluate efforts that:
Encourage healthy behaviors in relationships.
Create safe homes and neighborhoods by addressing factors like economic conditions, housing, and education.
Identify and address vulnerabilities during health care visits.
End business profits from trafficking-related transactions.
Everyone can learn to recognize the signs of trafficking
and know where to get help.
Need help? Know someone who does?
If you are a victim of trafficking or have information about a potential trafficking situation, contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline
. Call 1-888-373-7888 (TTY: 711), text 233733, or use the online live chat
. If you or someone else is in immediate danger, call 911.

About Sexual Violence
KEY POINTS
Sexual violence is a significant problem in the United States.
Sexual violence has a profound impact on lifelong health, opportunity, and well-being.
What is sexual violence?
Sexual violence is sexual activity when consent is not obtained or freely given. It impacts every community and affects both sexes and people of all sexual orientations and ages. Anyone can experience or perpetrate sexual violence.
The perpetrator of sexual violence is usually someone the survivor knows. This can include a friend, current or former intimate partner, coworker, neighbor, or family member. Sexual violence can occur in person, online, or through technology. This includes posting or sharing sexual pictures of someone without their consent, or non-consensual sexting.
Did you know?
Child sexual abuse is a form of sexual violence. Read more information about child sexual abuse.
Quick facts and stats
Researchers know the numbers underestimate this problem because many cases are unreported. Survivors may be ashamed, embarrassed, or afraid to tell the police, friends, or family about the violence. Victims may also keep quiet because they have been threatened or do not think anyone will help them.
Sexual violence is common:
Over half of women and almost one in three men have experienced sexual violence involving physical contact during their lifetimes. 1
One in four women and about one in 26 men have experienced completed or attempted rape.1
About one in nine men were made to penetrate someone during his lifetime. 1
One in three women and about one in nine men experienced sexual harassment in a public place.1
Sexual violence starts early:
More than four in five female rape survivors reported that they were first raped before age 25 and almost half were first raped as a minor (i.e., before age 18). 1
Nearly eight in 10 male rape survivors reported they were made to penetrate someone before age 25 and about four in 10 were first made to penetrate as a minor.1
Some groups are affected more than others. Women and racial and ethnic minority groups experience a higher burden of sexual violence.12345 For example, more than two in five non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native and non-Hispanic multiracial women were raped in their lifetime.1
Sexual violence is also costly. Recent estimates put the lifetime cost of rape at $122,461 per survivor, including medical care, lost productivity from work, and criminal justice costs.6
Outcomes
Some consequences are physical, like bruising and genital injuries, sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy (for women). Some consequences are psychological, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.7
The consequences may be chronic. Survivors may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and experience recurring reproductive, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and sexual health problems.7
Sexual violence is also linked to negative health behaviors. Sexual violence survivors are more likely to smoke, abuse alcohol, use drugs, and engage in risky sexual activity.8
The trauma from sexual violence may impact a survivor's employment. This refers to time off from work, diminished performance, job loss, or inability to work. These issues disrupt earning power and have a long-term effect on the economic well-being of survivors and their families. Coping and completing everyday tasks after victimization can be challenging. Survivors may have difficulty maintaining personal relationships, returning to work or school, and regaining a sense of normalcy.7
Sexual violence is also connected to other forms of violence. For example, girls who have been sexually abused are more likely to experience additional sexual violence. They are also more likely to become victims of intimate partner violence in adulthood. Bullying perpetration in early middle school is linked to sexual harassment perpetration in high school.9
Prevention
Sexual violence can be prevented. Certain factors my increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing sexual violence.
Preventing sexual violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence. We must also understand how historical trauma and structural inequalities impact health.1
Changing social norms, teaching skills, empowering girls and women, and creating protective environments can help prevent and reduce sexual violence. We all have a role to play in prevention.

Sharps Safety Program Resources
WHAT TO KNOW
CDC developed the Sharps Safety Workbook to help healthcare facilities prevent needlesticks and other sharps-related injuries to healthcare personnel.
Background
Occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens from needlesticks and other sharps injuries is a serious problem, resulting in approximately 385,000 needlesticks and other sharps-related injuries to hospital-based healthcare personnel each year. Similar injuries occur in other healthcare settings, such as nursing homes, clinics, emergency care services, and private homes. Sharps injuries are primarily associated with occupational transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but they have been implicated in the transmission of more than 20 other pathogens.

About Fatigue and Work
AT A GLANCE
Fatigue can affect anyone and be related to many work-related factors.
Work-related fatigue can affect worker safety and health.
Employers and workers should work together to reduce fatigue risks and manage fatigue.
Overview
In workplace settings, fatigue is commonly associated with nonstandard schedules which disrupt or shorten sleep. Examples of nonstandard schedules include night shift work and extended work hours.
Fatigue can also be associated with other workplace factors, such as:
Stress
Physically or mentally demanding tasks
Working in hot environments
It can stem from several different factors and its effects extend beyond sleepiness.
Fatigue can:
Slow down reaction times
Reduce attention or concentration
Limit short-term memory
Impair judgment
High levels of fatigue can affect any worker in any job. It has serious consequences for worker safety and health.
To keep workers safe and healthy, employers should:
Learn the risks for fatigue-related events.
Identify the sources of fatigue.
Use strategies to prevent and manage fatigue.

About Escherichia coli Infection
KEY POINTS
E. coli are bacteria found in many places like the intestines of people and animals.
Most kinds of E. coli are harmless, but some can make you sick.
This site focuses on the kinds of E. coli that cause diarrhea.
Overview
E. coli are germs called bacteria. They are found in many places, including in the environment, foods, water, and the intestines of people and animals.
Most E. coli are harmless and are part of a healthy intestinal tract. E. coli help us digest food, produce vitamins, and protect us from harmful germs.

But some E. coli can make people sick with diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, sepsis, and other illnesses. This website focuses on the kinds of E. coli that cause diarrhea.
People can get infected after swallowing E. coli.
This can happen through contaminated food or water or contact with animals, environments, or other people.
Some people are more likely to get infected.
Groups of people who are at increased risk for E. coli infection include:
Children younger than 5
Adults 65 and older
People with weakened immune systems
International travelers
E. coli infection can be serious.
Infection with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) can lead to a serious health condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems, and even death.
E. coli infection can be prevented.
The good news is that you can take steps to help keep yourself and your family safe.

JANUARY 10, 2024
About Shigella Infection
KEY POINTS
Shigella are bacteria (germs) that cause diarrhea.
The most common ways people get sick are from eating or drinking contaminated food or water and contact with someone who is sick or has recently been sick with Shigella infection.
Shigella can also be spread during sexual activity with a sick person.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
What it is
Shigella bacteria cause an infection called shigellosis. Shigella cause an estimated 450,000 infections in the United States each year, and antimicrobial resistant infections result in an estimated $93 million in direct medical costs.
The four species of Shigella are:
Shigella sonnei (the most common species in the United States)
Shigella flexneri
Shigella boydii
Shigella dysenteriae
S. dysenteriae and S. boydii are rare in the United States, though they continue to be important causes of disease in areas with less access to resources. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can be deadly.
Symptoms
Symptoms usually start 1–2 days after infection and last 7 days. Most people with shigellosis experience:
Diarrhea that can be bloody or prolonged (lasting more than 3 days)
Fever
Stomach pain
Feeling the need to pass stool (poop) even when the bowels are empty
Keep Reading:
Signs and Symptoms of Shigella Infection
Who is at risk
Some groups of people are more likely to get sick with shigellosis than others.
Children younger than 5 years old are the most likely to get shigellosis, but people of all ages can get the disease. Many outbreaks occur in early care and education settings and schools.
Travelers to places where water and food may be unsafe and sanitation is poor are more likely to get a Shigella infection. They are also more likely to become sick with types of Shigella that are more difficult to treat.
Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men* (GBMSM) have factors that put them at increased risk for Shigella infection. Although rates are higher among GBMSM, the risk is present for any sexual activity involving stool exposure.
People who are experiencing homelessness are at high risk for Shigella infection when there is shigellosis spread in the community. They may face challenges in their living situations that increase the risk for disease transmission, which can result in outbreaks.
How it spreads
Shigella spreads easily; swallowing just a small amount of Shigella germs can make you sick.
Shigella germs are in poop, so anything that gets contaminated by poop can potentially spread the germs. Shigella can spread from one person to another or through contaminated water, food, surfaces, or objects.
Keep Reading:
How Shigella Spreads
Prevention
You can take steps to avoid getting or spreading Shigella.
Wash your hands with soap and water at key times.
Take care when changing diapers.
Avoid swallowing water while swimming.
When traveling internationally, follow safe food and water habits and clean your hands often.
If you or your partner has been diagnosed with shigellosis, do not have sex for at least two weeks after the diarrhea ends.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Shigella Infection
Treatment and recovery
People who have shigellosis usually get better without antibiotic treatment in 5 to 7 days. People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest.
Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicine to treat illness caused by Shigella.
If you have diarrhea, drink a lot of water or other fluids to avoid dehydration (loss of fluids).

JANUARY 17, 2025
About Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
KEY POINTS
About 1 in every 3 people in the United States will have shingles (or herpes zoster) in their lifetime.
Shingles can sometimes lead to serious complications like long-term nerve pain and vision loss.
The best way to protect yourself from shingles is vaccination.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Shingles is a painful rash illness. People get shingles when the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox, reactivates in their bodies after they have already had chickenpox.
An estimated 1 million people get shingles each year in this country. Most people who develop shingles only have it one time during their life. However, you can have shingles more than once.
Signs and symptoms
People with shingles most commonly have a rash around the left or right side of the body. The rash is usually painful, itchy, or tingly.
Shingles can lead to serious complications. The most common shingles complication is long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN.
Keep Reading:
Shingles Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
You are at risk for shingles if:
You have had chickenpox.
More than 99% of Americans born before 1980 had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it. Children can have shingles, but it is not common.
Your risk of shingles and serious complications increases:
As you get older.
If you have medical conditions that keep your immune systems from working properly such as certain cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, and HIV infection.
If you take drugs that keep your immune system from working properly, like steroids and drugs given after an organ transplant.
Causes and spread
If you are near someone with shingles:
You cannot get shingles from someone who has shingles.
You can get chickenpox from someone who has shingles if you never had chickenpox or never got chickenpox vaccine. You could then develop shingles later in life.
Shingles is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus stays in their body. The virus can reactivate later in life and cause shingles.
People who never had chickenpox or didn't get chickenpox vaccine can get infected with VZV from someone who has shingles. These people can get the virus through:
Direct contact with the fluid from shingles rash blisters.
Breathing in virus particles that come from the blisters.
People with chickenpox are more likely to spread VZV than people with shingles.
Keep Reading:
About Chickenpox
Prevention
Protect yourself with the vaccine. CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy.
Keep Reading:
Shingles Vaccine Recommendations
The best way to prevent shingles is by getting 2 doses of the vaccine.
If you have shingles, protect others
Covering the shingles rash can lower the risk of spreading the shingles virus to others. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before the blisters appear or after the rash scabs over.
To prevent spreading the virus to others:
Cover the rash
Avoid touching or scratching the rash
Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds
Avoid contact with the following people until your rash scabs over
Pregnant women who never had chickenpox or chickenpox vaccine
Premature or low birth weight infants
People with weakened immune systems
Treatment and recovery
Several antiviral medicines are available to treat shingles:
Acyclovir (ay-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Valacyclovir (va-luh-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Famciclovir (fam-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
These medicines shorten the length and severity of the illness. They work best when you take them as soon as the rash appears. If you think you have shingles, contact your doctor as soon as possible to talk about treatment.
Pain relief medicine may help with the pain caused by shingles. This can be over the counter or a prescription from your doctor. Wet compresses, calamine lotion, and warm oatmeal baths may help relieve itching.

MARCH 12, 2024
Workplace Mold and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Indoor dampness and mold result from water leaks in buildings.
Exposures in damp buildings are complex. They vary from building to building and in different places within a building.
Dampness and mold are associated with various respiratory and non-respiratory health problems in workers.
Sources
Sources of water incursion are often apparent like leaks in the roof or windows or a broken pipe. Sources of water incursion are less obvious when affected materials and water sources are hidden.
Examples include wet insulation in a ceiling or moisture in building foundation due to sloping of surrounding land.
Problems occur when materials in buildings become wet for extended periods of time. Excessive moisture in the air, such as high relative humidity, can also lead to excessive dampness.
Moisture allows indoor mold to grow and multiply on building materials and surfaces. People inside damp buildings may be exposed to microbes, compounds released by microbes, and their structural components, such as spores and fungal fragments.
Mold can produce substances that may cause or worsen health problems. These substances vary depending on the mold species and on conditions related to the indoor environment. Moisture can also attract cockroaches, rodents, and dust mites. Moisture-damaged building materials can release volatile organic compounds or irritating airborne chemicals that may be associated with health problems.
Resources
Dampness and Mold Assessment Tool
Researchers have not found exactly how much exposure to dampness-related substances it takes to cause health problems. Studies report that finding and promptly correcting sources of dampness is more effective at preventing health problems than collecting and analyzing air samples for indoor microbes. NIOSH developed a tool to help assess areas of dampness and prioritize remediation of problems areas in buildings.

Silica and Worker Health
KEY POINTS
Millions of U.S. workers are exposed to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) in a variety of industries.
Silica dust can be released in the air when working.
Workers exposed to RCS can develop serious lung disease.
Overview
Silica dust is made up of small particles that can become airborne during work activities with materials that contain silica. Particles that are small enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs are called respirable.
Crystalline silica is typically found in:
Soil
Sand
Concrete
Mortar
Granite and other minerals
Artificial stone
The most common form of crystalline silica is quartz. However, it can also occur in the form of cristobalite and tridymite. Exposure to cristobalite typically occurs in foundries where intense heat of molten metal causes cristobalite to form in clay molds. Hazardous levels of respirable dust can be released into the air when working with materials that contain silica.
Silicosis, an irreversible but preventable lung disease, is caused by inhalation of RCS. Work exposures to RCS also cause other serious diseases, including lung cancer.
Risks
Worker cutting stone countertop using wet method.
Exposures can occur during the following activities:
Glass, pottery, ceramics, bricks, concrete, and artificial stone manufacturing
Abrasive blasting
Foundry work
Hydraulic fracturing
Stonecutting
Rock drilling
Quarry work
Tunneling
There are various industries where workers can have jobs at risk for RCS exposure. Examples include:
Construction
Mining
Oil and gas extraction
Stone countertop fabrication
Foundries and other manufacturing settings
Dentistry

Sinus Infection Basics
KEY POINTS
Stuffy nose that just isn't getting better? You might have a sinus infection, also called sinusitis.
You don't need antibiotics for many sinus infections, but your healthcare provider can decide if you need an antibiotic.
Overview
Sinus infections happen when fluid builds up in the air-filled pockets in the face (sinuses). This fluid buildup allows germs to grow.
When you have a sinus infection, one or more of your sinuses becomes inflamed. Fluid builds up, which can cause congestion and runny nose.
Signs and symptoms
Runny nose
Stuffy nose
Facial pain or pressure
Headache
Mucus dripping down the throat (post-nasal drip)
Sore throat
Cough
Bad breath
Risk factors
A previous cold.
Seasonal allergies.
Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.
Structural problems within the sinuses. For example, growths on the lining of the nose or sinuses, known as nasal polyps.
A weak immune system or taking drugs that weaken the immune system.
Causes
Viruses cause most sinus infections, but bacteria can cause some sinus infections.
Prevention
You can help prevent sinus infections by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including:
Clean your hands.
Receive recommended vaccines, such as the flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine.
Avoid close contact with people who have colds or other upper respiratory infections.
Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke.
Use a clean humidifier to moisten the air at home.
When to seek medical care
See a healthcare provider if you have:
Severe symptoms, such as severe headache or facial pain.
Symptoms that get worse after improving.
Symptoms lasting more than 10 days without getting better.
Fever longer than 3-4 days.
Multiple sinus infections in the past year.
This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider will determine if you have a sinus infection by asking about symptoms and examining you.
Treatment
You do not need antibiotics for many sinus infections. Most sinus infections usually get better on their own without antibiotics.
When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.
However, in some cases, you may need antibiotics. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best treatment for your illness.
For some sinus infections, your healthcare provider might recommend watchful waiting or delayed antibiotic prescribing.
Watchful waiting: Your healthcare provider may suggest watching and waiting for 2-3 days to see if you need antibiotics. This gives the immune system time to fight off the infection. If your symptoms don't improve, the healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic.
Delayed prescribing: Your healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic but suggest that you wait 2–3 days before filling the prescription. You may recover on your own and may not need the antibiotic.
How to feel better
Put a warm compress over the nose and forehead to help relieve sinus pressure.
Use a decongestant or saline nasal spray.
Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower.
Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed.
Over-the-counter medicine and children
Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Some over-the-counter medicines are not recommended for children of certain ages.
Pain relievers:
Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen.
Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain.
Cough and cold medicines:
Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children.
Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child’s healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child.
Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking.

About Skin Exposures and Effects
KEY POINTS
Chemicals can enter the body through the skin and injure individual organs or groups of organs
Workers in multiple industries and sector may face risks of absorbing chemicals through the skin
Absorbing workplace chemicals through the skin can cause diseases and disorders that include occupational skin diseases.
Skin Notation Profiles describe what happens when chemicals contact the skin.
Overview
Most efforts to address chemical hazards have focused on breathing chemicals in rather than absorbing through skin. Because of this, researchers have developed many ways to assess the effects of chemicals that workers inhale. However, there are fewer methods to assess skin exposures.
Skin Notation Profiles
NIOSH assigns skin notations for individual chemicals or chemical compounds. Skin notations describe what happens when chemicals contact the skin and directly damage organs or prompt the body's immune response. The immune response causes skin conditions like allergic contact dermatitis or skin irritation.
Occupational skin disease are one of the most common types of workplace diseases. They can take different forms, such as:
Rash (contact dermatitis) caused by skin irritation
Rash caused by skin allergies
Skin cancers
Skin infections
Other skin diseases
Dermal Absorption
Dermal absorption happens when a chemical goes through the skin and travels into the body. Many chemicals used in the workplace can damage organs if they penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream. Examples of these chemicals include pesticides and organic solvents.
How fast the skin absorbs chemicals depends largely on the outer layer of the skin called the stratum corneum. The stratum corneum provides a barrier by keeping molecules from passing into and out of the skin. This barrier protects the lower layers of skin. How much the skin absorbs chemicals depends on the following factors:
Skin integrity (damaged or intact)
The place on the skin where the chemicals are absorbed. This includes features like thickness and water content of stratum corneum and skin temperature.
Physical and chemical properties of the chemical
Concentration of the chemical on the skin surface
How long the skin absorbs the chemical
The surface area of skin that absorbs the chemical
Contact Dermatitis
Contact dermatitis, also called eczema, happens when the skin becomes inflamed from contact with a chemical. Contact dermatitis is the most common form of reported occupational skin disease. Research suggests that contact dermatitis makes up 90–95% of occupational skin disease cases in the United States.
Common symptoms of dermatitis include the following:
Itching
Pain
Redness
Swelling
Small blisters or wheals (itchy, red circles with a white center) on the skin
Dry, flaking, scaly skin that may crack
Types of Occupational Contact Dermatitis
Irritant contact dermatitis involves a chemical directly damaging and inflaming skin. The damage often occurs only to the place where the skin absorbs the chemical.
The following factors may cause irritant contact dermatitis:
Phototoxic responses (such as tar)
Brief contact with highly irritating chemicals (such as acids, bases, or oxidizing/reducing agents)
Mild irritants that cause damage over time (such as water, detergents, or weak cleaning agents).
Allergic contact dermatitis happens when a chemical that the skin absorbs causes the body's immune system to produce an allergic reaction. For this to happen, a worker must be sensitive or allergic to the allergen. When the skin absorbs the chemical allergen again, the chemical may cause an immune reaction that inflames the skin. The reaction can go beyond the place where the skin absorbed the chemical.
The following factors may cause allergic contact dermatitis:
Industrial compounds (such as metals, epoxy and acrylic resins, or rubber additives)
Agrochemicals (such as pesticides and fertilizers)
Commercial chemicals
The symptoms and the appearance of irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis are similar. Clinical testing (such as patch testing) is often necessary to tell the difference between them. Contact dermatitis can be mild or severe, depending on many factors that include the following:
Characteristics of the chemical
Concentration of the chemical
How often the skin absorbs the chemical
Environmental factors, such as temperature or humidity
Condition of the skin, such as healthy or damaged, dry, or wet

PARASITES 
SEPTEMBER 10, 2024
About Sleeping Sickness
KEY POINTS
Sleeping sickness, also known as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is a disease caused by a parasite.
You can get the parasite that causes sleeping sickness from the bite of a tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa.
Sleeping sickness is a serious disease. Diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Sleeping sickness (i.e., human African trypanosomiasis or HAT) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Sleeping sickness spreads through the bite of a tsetse fly (Glossina species), found only in rural, sub-Saharan Africa
. The disease causes death if left untreated. There are two types of sleeping sickness. Each one is named for the region in Africa where it was historically found.
Types
There are two types of sleeping sickness:
West African sleeping sickness
Spread by bites from a tsetse fly carrying the parasite T. b. gambiense.
Disease is slow to progress (a few months to a year or more after exposure).
Found in rural parts of Central and West Africa.
The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the number of West African sleeping sickness cases reported
each year to its website.
East African sleeping sickness
Spread by bites from a tsetse fly carrying the parasite T. b. rhodesiense.
Disease progresses in severity very quickly (one to several weeks after exposure).
Found in rural parts of Eastern and Southern Africa and less commonly reported than West African sleeping sickness.
The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the number of East African sleeping sickness cases reported
each year to its website.
Level 1 Travel Notice
CDC has issued a Level 1 travel notice, Practice Usual Precautions, for East African Sleeping Sickness in Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Signs and symptoms
Sleeping sickness occurs in two stages. The first stage typically causes mild, flu-like symptoms. The second stage causes more severe symptoms that affect your brain and central nervous system. Symptoms of each stage take longer to appear in West African sleeping sickness.
If you recently traveled to east or west Africa and were bitten by a tsetse fly, you could have sleeping sickness. Some people who have sleeping sickness develop a red sore, called a chancre, within two days to two weeks of an infected tsetse fly bite but chancres are not always present or noticed.

Symptoms of Sleeping Sickness
Risk factors
Sleeping sickness affects people in rural areas of African countries. Travelers to urban areas in those countries are at low risk.
People at higher risk include:
Hunters
Villagers with infected cattle herds
Tourists visiting and others working in game parks
Tsetse flies that spread sleeping sickness live only in some African countries. Most flies in these rural areas are not carrying the parasite that causes sleeping sickness. However, the more often you are bitten, the more you are at risk of infection.
You cannot contract the disease in the U.S.
How it spreads
You can get sleeping sickness from the bite of an infective tsetse fly.
Occasionally, a pregnant women may pass the parasite Trypanosoma brucei to her unborn baby.
Although rare and not well documented, the parasite may also spread through
Sexual contact
Blood transfusion
Organ transplantation
Accidental laboratory exposure
Prevention
There is no vaccine or drug available to prevent sleeping sickness.
The best way to prevent infection is to prevent bites from the tsetse fly:
Wear protective, neutral-colored clothing, including long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and socks.
Inspect vehicles for tsetse flies before entering.
Avoid bushes.
Use insect repellant.
Read more: Prevent Sleeping Sickness
Diagnosis
There are several tests that can diagnose sleeping sickness. Talk with your healthcare provider right away if you have traveled to rural areas of the countries in Africa where sleeping sickness spreads
and are experiencing any of the symptoms or think you may have sleeping sickness.
Treatment
If diagnosed with sleeping sickness, start medical treatment as soon as possible. Your laboratory results should guide your treatment.
Hospitalization is usually necessary for treatment. Follow-up care may require lumbar puncture (spinal tap) every six months or sooner, if symptoms return, for two years.

Small Business Safety and Health
KEY POINTS
Smaller businesses tend to have higher rates of injuries and illness than larger businesses.
When compared to larger businesses, small businesses often face a lack of resources for safety and health practices, place greater time demands on managers, and have fewer employees to engage in activities such as safety committees.
Overview
In 2021, there were approximately 6.3 million businesses in the United States with employees, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In regard to small businesses
33% of the U.S. workforce is in a firm with < 100 employees.
90% of U.S. businesses have < 20 employees and
80% of U.S. businesses have < 10 employees
The definition of a “small” business varies widely, particularly as it relates to workplace safety and health. The characteristics that distinguish a smaller business from a larger one in terms of occupational safety and health include not only number of employees but also the structure (including sole proprietorships), the age of the business (most new businesses are small), and a manager-centered culture (the owner/operator sets the culture of the business). Despite the stereotype of a small business as a small town retail or service firm, some smaller businesses do not fit the stereotype, e.g., high-tech manufacturing startups.
For most occupational safety and health research purposes, the NIOSH Small Business Assistance Program considers small businesses as having fewer than 50 employees. This number is consistent with European Union criteria for defining small enterprises, as well as the Affordable Care Act cutoff for requiring employers to provide health insurance to employees.
Small business challenges
Risky economic environment
Small Businesses struggle to exist in a risky economic environment. Market forces, structural changes, and emerging social and business climate threats may affect levels of resources available for occupational safety and health initiatives for small businesses.
While two-thirds of new small businesses survive at least 2 years, only 44% survive at least 4 years. These numbers are consistent across sectors. One research team found that businesses that lasted five years had less than half the annual workplace injury rate as businesses that lasted only two years.
Financial limitations
Financial limitations are frequently cited by small business owners as a barrier to implementing recommended health and safety programs. Other issues frequently take precedence when small businesses survive on the edge of viability. For example, according to a National Federation of Independent Business membership survey, the number one small business issue is the cost and availability of insurance.
Small business assistance program
The Small Business Assistance (SBA) research program focuses on conducting research to better prevent injuries, illnesses, and deaths in small businesses and increasing awareness and use of effective interventions among small businesses.

About the Small Business Innovation Research Program
KEY POINTS
The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program encourages small business to engage in research and development (R&D). SBIR targets innovations in diagnostics, data science (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, etc.), surveillance, occupational safety and health, and public health to support the health promotion and disease prevention needs of CDC.
Overview
The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a set-aside program (3.2% of an agency's extramural budget) for domestic small business concerns to engage in Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization and public benefit. The SBIR program was established under the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-219).
CDC's SBIR Program targets innovations in diagnostics, data science (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, etc.), surveillance, occupational safety and health, and public health to support the health promotion and disease prevention needs of CDC. Today, CDC's SBIR program is under the stewardship of the Office of Science (OS). CDC is committed to ensuring a competitive award process that results in projects of scientific excellence and technological innovation with the potential for commercialization.
The SBIR Program encourages small business to engage in research and development (R&D). Program goals include:
Use small businesses to stimulate technological innovation,
Strengthen the role of small business in meeting Federal R/R&D needs,
Increase private-sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal research and development funding,
Increase small business participation in Federal R/R&D, and
Foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by socially and economically disadvantaged (SDB) persons and women-owned small businesses (WOSB).
Eligible institutions/organizations
Only U.S.-based small business concerns (SBCs) are eligible to submit SBIR applications. A SBC is one that, on the date of award for both Phase I and Phase II funding agreements, meets ALL of the criteria as described in the current SBIR parent funding opportunity announcements available at the NIH Small Business Funding Opportunities
.
Three phases of SBIR
Funding is awarded competitively and is available for only Phases I and II of the SBIR Program:
Phase I contract awards up to $243,500 for approximately 6 months and Phase I grant awards up to $314,363* for project timeline that is typically 6 months (but may extend to 12 months) to support exploration of the technical merit or feasibility of an idea or technology.
Phase II awards projects that expand Phase I results. Awards can range up to $2,095,748* for a project period of up to 2 years. During this time, the R&D work is performed, and the developer evaluates commercialization potential.
Phase III is the period during which Phase II innovation moves from the laboratory into the marketplace. At this stage, the small business must find funding in the private sector or other non-SBIR federal agency funding.
*CDC has a waiver from the Small Business Administration to exceed these budgets for CDC's Grant Topic Areas of Interest. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact CDC program officials early in the application planning process and before submitting any application in excess of the total award amounts listed above.
CDC's SBIR funding opportunities
CDC currently participates in SBIR Omnibus/Parent Clinical Trial Not Allowed Funding Opportunity Announcement (PA-24-245
) and SBIR Omnibus/Parent Clinical Trial Required Funding Opportunity Announcement (PA-24-246
). See HHS Program Descriptions document pages 164-194 for CDC's research topics of interest.
CDC participates along with the NIH in the PHS-2025-1 SBIR Contract Solicitation
The contract solicitation receipt date was October 18, 2024, 5 p.m. EDT.
HHS held the Contract Solicitation Pre-proposal webinar (PHS-2025-1), on September 23, 2024, to discuss the PHS-2025-1
solicitation. Please see the solicitation and webinar resources here.
SBIR report fraud, waste, and abuse

About Smallpox
KEY POINTS
Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by the variola virus.
Smallpox has been eradicated, with no cases occurring since 1977.
The disease caused rashes and could spread through coughing and sneezing.
Smallpox no longer occurs naturally, but it is possible that variola virus could be used in a biological attack. Although unlikely, public health authorities prepare for the possibility of smallpox being used as a weapon.

Overview
Before smallpox was eradicated, it was a serious infectious disease caused by the variola virus. It was contagious—meaning, it spread from one person to another. People who had smallpox had a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash.
Most people with smallpox recovered, but about 3 out of every 10 people with the disease died. Many smallpox survivors have permanent scars over large areas of their body, especially their faces. Some are left blind.
Thanks to the success of vaccination, smallpox was eradicated, and no cases of naturally occurring smallpox have happened since 1977. The last natural outbreak of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949. The World Health Assembly declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.

History of Smallpox
Signs and symptoms
A person with smallpox goes through several stages as the disease progresses, including rash and scabs.

Signs and Symptoms of Smallpox
How it spreads
Before smallpox was eradicated, it was mainly spread by direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact between people.

How Smallpox Spreads
Prevention
There are vaccines to protect people from smallpox. Currently, smallpox vaccines are not recommended for the general public because smallpox has been eradicated. If there were a smallpox outbreak, health officials would use smallpox vaccines to control it.

Health Effects of Smokeless Tobacco
WHAT TO KNOW
Smokeless tobacco products can contain nicotine, which is addictive.
Smokeless tobacco products cause cancer of the mouth, esophagus, and pancreas.
These products can cause nicotine poisoning in children.
Smokeless tobacco is associated with many health problems
Using smokeless tobacco:
Can lead to nicotine addiction.12
Causes cancer of the mouth, esophagus, and pancreas. The esophagus is the passage that connects the throat to the stomach. The pancreas is a gland that helps with digestion and maintaining proper blood sugar levels.12
Is associated with diseases of the mouth, such as leukoplakia and cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx.13
Can increase risks for early delivery and stillbirth when used during pregnancy.2
Can cause nicotine poisoning in children.4
May increase the risk for death from heart disease and stroke.13
Fact
Using smokeless products can cause serious health problems.
Protect your health; don't start. If you do use them, quit.
Addiction to smokeless tobacco
Smokeless tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive.12
Nicotine affects the developing brain.
Nicotine addiction may make it more likely to start using cigarettes.
Young people who use smokeless tobacco may be more likely to also use cigarettes.5
Smokeless tobacco and cancer
Smokeless tobacco causes cancer of the mouth, esophagus, and pancreas.1
Many smokeless tobacco products contain cancer-causing chemicals.16
The most harmful chemicals are tobacco-specific nitrosamines.1 These are organic compounds that may increase the risk of cancer. They form during the growing, curing, fermenting, and aging of tobacco. The amount of these chemicals present varies by product.1
The higher the levels of these chemicals, the greater the risk for cancer.2
Other chemicals found in tobacco can also cause cancer. These include:6
A radioactive element (polonium-210) found in fertilizer used to grow tobacco and which is taken up into the tobacco plant.
Chemicals formed when tobacco is cured with heat (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons—also known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)
Harmful metals (arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, nickel, mercury)
Smokeless tobacco and oral disease
Smokeless tobacco can cause white or gray patches inside the mouth (leukoplakia) that can lead to cancer.1
Smokeless tobacco can cause gum disease, tooth decay, and tooth loss.123
Reproductive and developmental risks
Using smokeless tobacco during pregnancy can increase the risk for early delivery and stillbirth.2
When smokeless tobacco products are used during pregnancy the nicotine can affect how a baby's brain develops before birth.27
Other risks
Using smokeless tobacco increases the risk for death from heart disease and stroke.13
Smokeless tobacco can cause nicotine poisoning in children.4

MAY 15, 2024
Social Connection
KEY POINTS
Staying connected to others creates feelings of belonging and being loved, cared for, and valued.
Social connections are important to our mental and physical health.
Being connected to others helps protect against serious illness and disease.
People with stronger social bonds are more likely to live longer, healthier lives.
Overview
Social connection is the size and diversity of one's social network and roles, the functions these relationships serve, and their positive or negative qualities.
Social connectedness reflects the continuum of meeting social connection needs. It is the degree to which you have the number, quality, and variety of relationships that you want. It is when you feel like you belong and have the support and care that you need.
Supportive social connections can lead to longer and healthier lives.
Why it's important
Protection against chronic disease and serious illness
High-quality relationships can help people live longer, healthier lives. Social connection can help reduce the risk of chronic disease and serious illness, such as:
Heart disease.
Stroke.
Dementia.
Depression and anxiety.
Positive health benefits
Social connection can lead to longer life, better health, and well-being. It can improve:
Our ability to manage stress, anxiety, and depression.
Healthy eating habits and physical activity.
Quality of sleep.
How it works
Creating social connections
People are social creatures by nature. Our relationships with family, friends, coworkers, and community members are important to our survival.
Stable and supportive relationships give us the support we need to cope with stressful life challenges.
People with healthy relationships are more likely to make healthy choices that lead to better mental and physical health.
Social connections give us:
Emotional support: people we can turn to during good times and hard times.
Physical support:
A ride to the doctor or grocery store.
Help with childcare on short notice.
Community connections
Communities that offer supportive connections are just as important. They can help create trust and resilience among community members in public places, such as:
Neighborhoods.
Schools.
Places of worship.
Workplaces.
Parks and recreation centers.
Having safe access to public areas for people to connect encourages:
Connections among people in the community.
Less social isolation and loneliness.
Community members to give back, further strengthening the bonds.

Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)
WHAT TO KNOW
Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes. They are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, worship, and age. These conditions include a wide set of forces and systems that shape daily life such as economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies, and political systems. CDC has adapted this definition from the World Health Organization.
Why are SDOH important to CDC?
SDOH are one of three priority areas for Healthy People 2030
, along with health equity and health literacy. Healthy People 2030 sets data-driven national objectives in five key areas of SDOH
: healthcare access and quality, education access and quality, social and community context, economic stability, and neighborhood and built environment. Some examples of SDOH included in Healthy People 2030 are safe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods; polluted air and water; and access to nutritious foods and physical health opportunities.
As the federal government's leading public health agency, CDC has a unique role in contributing to work on SDOH.
Why is addressing SDOH important for CDC and public health?
Addressing differences in SDOH accelerates progress toward health equity, a state in which every person has the opportunity to attain their highest level of health. SDOH have been shown to have a greater influence on health than either genetic factors or access to healthcare services. For example, poverty is highly correlated with poorer health outcomes and higher risk of premature death.A SDOH, including the effects of centuries of racism, are key drivers of health inequities within communities of color. The impact is pervasive and deeply embedded in our society, creating inequities in access to a range of social and economic benefits—such as housing, education, wealth, and employment. These inequities put people at higher risk of poor health.
CDC is coordinating efforts to focus its resources on the areas where federal public health investments can make the most difference. For example, CDC's Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) focuses on reducing high rates of chronic diseases for specific racial and ethnic groups in urban, rural, and tribal communities. Since 1999, the program has worked across sectors in racial and ethnic minority communities to reduce tobacco use, improve access to healthy foods, change the built environment to promote physical activity, and connect people to clinical care.
Public health actions that affect SDOH
Public health organizations can:
Convene
Bring together community members and organizations to identify local concerns.
CDC has a long history of convening partners through national conferences, webinars, collaborative publications, and guideline development. CDC also encourages other public health organizations to act as conveners by including coalition-building or community engagement activities as a requirement in some funded projects.
Integrate
Collect and use multiple sources of data, including public health data, to help develop strategies for set direction. For example, public health departments can provide GIS maps of community needs and assets based on CDC PLACES dataB and environmental justice dataC.
Influence
Lead approaches to develop policies and solutions or leverage funding through various mechanisms to implement and expand priority actions. For example, when CDC Director Rochelle Walensky announced that racism is a public health threat in 2021, it reinforced actions that communities were already taking and supported many others as they took subsequent actions.
Contribute to big changes
Collaborate with others to find innovative solutions and put them into place. For example, an LA County public health initiative
resulted in the ban of menthol cigarettes.

Sodium Azide
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Sodium azide is a fact acting and potentially deadly chemical.
Signs and symptoms of sodium azide poisoning depend on the amount, how you were exposed, and for how long.
Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed.
Background
Sodium azide is a fast acting, potentially deadly chemical that is an odorless white solid.
When it is mixed with water or an acid, sodium azide changes quickly to a toxic gas with a sharp smell. It also changes into a toxic gas (hydrazoic acid) when it comes in contact with solid metals. For example, when it is poured into a drain pipe containing lead or copper.
The smell of the gas may not be sharp enough to give people a good enough warning of the danger.
Where it is found
Sodium azide is best known as the chemical found in automobile airbags. The automobile impact causes an electrical charge which makes sodium azide explode and change to nitrogen gas inside the airbag.
Sodium azide is used as a chemical preservative (product that makes things last longer) in hospitals and laboratories. Accidents have occurred in these settings. In one case, sodium azide was poured into a drain, where it exploded and the toxic gas was inhaled (breathed in).
Sodium azide is used in agriculture (farming) for pest control.
Sodium azide is also used in detonators and other explosives.
How it works
Breathing the gas that is formed from sodium azide causes the most harm. However, ingesting (swallowing) sodium azide can be toxic (harmful) as well.
The gas formed from sodium azide is most dangerous in enclosed places where the gas will be trapped. The toxic gas quickly spreads in open spaces, making it less harmful outdoors. The gas formed from sodium azide is less dense (lighter) than air, so it will rise.
Sodium azide prevents the cells of the body from using oxygen. When this happens, the cells die. The heart and the brain use a lot of oxygen. Therefore, sodium azide is more harmful to the heart and the brain than to other organs.
Signs and symptoms
The level of sodium azide poisoning depends on the amount, route (how someone was exposed), and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and if they had any medical conditions when they were exposed.
People can be exposed to sodium azide by breathing it, absorbing it through their skin, or eating foods with it.
Exposure to a small amount may have some or all of the following symptoms within minutes:
Clear drainage from the nose (from gas or dust exposure)
Cough (from gas or dust exposure)
Dizziness
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
Rapid (fast) breathing
Rapid (fast) heart rate
Red eyes (from gas or dust exposure)
Restlessness
Weakness
Skin burns and blisters (from explosion or direct skin contact)
Exposure to a large amount of sodium azide by any route may cause these other health effects as well:
Convulsions
Low blood pressure
Loss of consciousness
Lung injury
Respiratory failure leading to death
Slow heart rate
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to sodium azide.
Exposure
Tip
Do not pour things with sodium azide (such as food, water, or vomit) in the drain. The drain can explode and cause serious harm.
If sodium azide is in water, you could be exposed to sodium azide by drinking the water.
If sodium azide came into contact with food, you could be exposed to sodium azide by eating the food.
If sodium azide is in the air, you could be exposed by breathing in the dust or the gas.
Sodium azide can also enter the body and cause symptoms through skin contact. An explosion with sodium azide can cause burn injury and expose people to the toxic gas, hydrozoic acid.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get fresh air by leaving the area where the sodium azide was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chances of death from sodium azide.
If the sodium azide was released outside, move away from the area where the sodium azide was released. Stay low to the ground, because sodium azide gas rises. If sodium azide was released indoors, get out of the building.
If someone swallowed sodium azide
Do not force them to vomit. Do not drink fluids. Seek medical attention right away. Do not try CPR using mouth to mouth breathing. It could expose you.
When sodium azide is swallowed, it mixes with stomach acid and forms the toxic gas, hydrozoic acid. If a person who has swallowed sodium azide is vomiting, stay away from the person. Also stay away from the stomach contents (vomit) to avoid exposure to the toxic gas. Seek medical attention right away.
If you are near a sodium azide release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate or ""shelter in place"" inside.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any sodium azide from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
No specific antidote (cure) exists for sodium azide poisoning. The most important thing is for people exposed to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.
Sodium azide poisoning is treated with supportive medical care in a hospital setting.
Long-term health effects
Survivors of serious sodium azide poisoning may have heart and brain damage.

Cyanide
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Cyanide is a fast acting and potentially deadly chemical.
Signs and symptoms of ammonia exposure depend on how much you were exposed to.
Get away from the area, get clean, and get medical care if exposed.
Background
Cyanide is a fast acting and potentially deadly chemical that affects the body's ability to use oxygen.
It comes from natural substances in some foods and in certain plants, including the pits and seeds of some common fruits.
Cyanide is sometimes described as having a ""bitter almond"" smell. It does not always give off a smell, and not everyone can smell it.
Types
Gas or liquid
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) - also known as ""AC"" in the military
Cyanogen chloride (CNCI) - also known as ""CK"" in the military
Solid (crystal)
Sodium cyanide (NaCN)
Potassium cyanide (KCN)
Uses of cyanide
Making paper, textiles and plastics
Developing photographs
Metallurgy
Includes electroplating, metal cleaning and removing gold from its ore
Killing pests and vermin
Signs and symptoms
Breathing in cyanide gas causes symptoms to show up the fastest, but swallowing solid or liquid cyanide can be dangerous too.
These symptoms can happen during or right after someone is exposed:
Chest pain and/or chest tightness
Dizziness, weakness, and/or confusion
Eye pain and/or eye tearing
Excitement
Restlessness
Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath or wheezing
Rapid or slow breathing
Rapid or slow heart rate
Headache
Nausea and/or vomiting
If exposed to large amounts, signs and symptoms include:
Coma
Death
High or low blood pressure
Loss of consciousness
Lung injury
Seizures
These symptoms can happen very quickly when exposed to a large amount of cyanide. These symptoms can happen with any type of exposure (breathing in, skin or eye contact, or swallowing).
Exposure
Water
If cyanide is in the water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the water.
Air
If cyanide is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the cyanide gas. If solid cyanide is put into water, it can make hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN or AC). This can increase chances of breathing in the gas.
Cyanide gas is most dangerous in enclosed places where gas will be trapped. Cyanide gas can spread quickly in open spaces depending on the weather. less harmful outdoors.
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN or AC) gas is lighter than air, so the gas will rise. Cyanogen Chloride (CNCl or CK) is heavier and will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there.
Cyanide in food
Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with cyanide can expose people to cyanide. This is more likely to happen with solid cyanide.
Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched liquid cyanide if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an cyanide release. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the cyanide was released and breathe fresh air.
If the cyanide release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the cyanide does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the cyanide was released.
If the cyanide release was indoors, get out of the building.
Resource
Make sure you understand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency broadcasts and local authorities for instructions.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. Showering is the best method for removing cyanide from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take your clothes off
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will prevent the cyanide from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
If you were exposed to solid cyanide, skip this step and wash your body as described in the next section.
If you were exposed to any form except solid cyanide, follow these steps to blot your body:
Use dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Use a different cloth or towel for each body part.
Start blotting with your head and hair.
Then blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds.
Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch cyanide. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.
Get help
To get help right away:
Call 911.
Go to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave.
Call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.
Treatment
The most important thing is for people to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.
If someone has swallowed cyanide, do not force vomiting.
Cyanide poisoning is treated with specific antidotes (treatment to reduce the effects of poison). Antidotes for cyanide poisoning are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.
It is also treated with supportive medical care in a hospital or by trained emergency personnel.
Long-term health effects
Survivors of large amounts of cyanide exposure may develop heart, brain, and nerve damage.

About Sodium and Health
KEY POINTS
Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium is bad for your health.
While sodium has many forms, most sodium we consume is from salt.
Most Americans consume too much sodium.
Most sodium comes from processed and restaurant foods.
Health risks
Eating too much sodium can increase your blood pressure and your risk for heart disease and stroke. Together, heart disease and stroke kill more Americans each year than any other cause.

Tips for Reducing Sodium Intake
Most people eat too much sodium
Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium is bad for your health. Americans consume more than 3,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, on average. This is well above the federal recommendation
of less than 2,300 mg of sodium daily for teens and adults as part of a healthy eating pattern.
Sodium in everyday foods adds up
Sodium is found in foods from almost all food categories. Some of the top sources of sodium for U.S. adults and children ages 1 and older include:
Sandwiches.
Rice, pasta, and other grain-based dishes.
Starchy and non-starchy vegetables.
Meat, poultry, and seafood dishes.
Pizza.
Soups.
Chips, crackers, and savory snacks.
Desserts and sweet snacks.
Condiments and gravies.
Cold cuts and cured meats.
Breads and tortillas.
Source: Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025
Sodium or salt?
Salt and sodium are not the same. Salt is sodium chloride which is table salt. Sodium chloride is 40% sodium and 60% chloride. One teaspoon of table salt contains about 2,400 mg of sodium.
Sodium is a mineral found in many ingredients in common foods:
Monosodium glutamate (MSG).
Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).
Sodium nitrate (a preservative).

About Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
KEY POINTS
Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria.
Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria: soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF), and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF).
Overview
Relapsing fever is an illness characterized by one or more episodes of fever, headache, and muscle pain that lasts several days and is separated by roughly a week of feeling well. Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria, which are distantly related to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria:
Soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), also known as tickborne relapsing fever
Hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF)
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)
There are differences in how severe the infection can be and where a person may be exposed.

About Soil-transmitted helminths
KEY POINTS
Soil-transmitted Helminths, or STH, are parasitic worms that live in the human intestine.
They spread through soil or water contaminated by human feces (poop) that contain the parasite larvae.
STH infections are considered neglected tropical diseases or NTDs.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities.
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer.
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are:
Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.
Contaminating drinking water sources.
Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.
Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil.
Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.
Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.
Hookworm
You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.
Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.
One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Blood and protein or nutrient loss
Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)
Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections
Wash your hands before handling food.
Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.
Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.
Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or ""preventive chemotherapy"".
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other ""neglected tropical diseases"" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.

NIOSH Factsheet: Solid Waste Industry
Español (Spanish) Print
  MARCH 2012
DHHS (NIOSH) PUBLICATION NUMBER 2012-140
The solid waste industry (Waste Management and Remediation, NAICS 562) consists of 3 groups: Collection; Treatment and Disposal; and Other Waste Remediation Services. In 2010, approximately 478,000 workers were employed in the solid waste industry with about 355,000 in private industry. About 72,500 of the private waste industry employees are classified as Refuse and Recyclable Materials Collectors (SOC 53-708) and 49,000 of these collection workers are employed by local government agencies. Occupational traumatic injury fatality data for 2003 – 2009 have been published for public and private sector workers but occupational injury and illness data for this period are available only for private sector workers. Effective health and safety programs which include hazard recognition and controls can reduce occupational injuries and illnesses and improve work conditions in the solid waste industry.

Soman
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Soman is a human-made warfare nerve agent.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
Get clean and get medical attention if you were exposed.
Background
Soman, also known as ""GD,"" is a human-made chemical warfare agent that is a type of nerve agent. It was originally developed as an insecticide (insect killer) in Germany in 1944.
Nerve agents are the most toxic (harmful) and fast acting of the known chemical warfare agents.
Nerve agents are similar to pesticides (insect killers) called organophosphates. They are similar in terms of how they work and the kinds of harmful effects they cause. However, nerve agents are much stronger than organophosphate pesticides.
Soman is a clear, colorless, tasteless liquid with a slight smell similar to camphor containing mothballs or rotten fruit. It can become a vapor (gas) if heated.
Where it is found
Soman is not found naturally in the environment.
It is possible that soman or other nerve agents were used in chemical warfare during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.
How it works
All the nerve agents cause their toxic effects by preventing enzymes from working. Enzymes act as the body's ""off switch"" for glands and muscles. Without an ""off switch,"" the glands and muscles are constantly being stimulated (worked). They may get tired and no longer be able to keep working on things such as breathing.
Compared with other nerve agents, soman is more volatile than VX (the strongest nerve agent) but less volatile than sarin. Higher volatility means it is more likely to evaporate from a liquid into a gas and spread into the environment.
Because soman is more volatile than VX, it will stay on surfaces for a shorter period of time compared with VX.
People can be exposed to the gas even if they do not come in contact with the liquid form. Because of its high volatility, soman is an immediate but short-lived threat. Soman does not last a long time in the environment.
Signs and symptoms
The level of soman poisoning depends on the amount of soman, how the person was exposed, and for how long.
Symptoms will likely appear within a few seconds after exposure to the vapor (gas) form of soman. Symptoms will likely appear within a few minutes to hours after exposure to the liquid form.
People can be exposed to soman by breathing it in, swallowing, or through skin absorption. Exposure to a low or medium amount can cause some or all of the following symptoms within seconds to hours:
Abnormally low or high blood pressure
Blurred vision
Chest tightness
Confusion
Cough
Diarrhea
Drooling and excessive sweating
Drowsiness
Eye pain
Headache
Increased urination
Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain
Rapid breathing
Runny nose
Slow or fast heart rate
Small, pinpoint pupils
Watery eyes
Weakness
Even a tiny drop of nerve agent on the skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching where the agent touched.
Exposure to a large amount of soman in any way can cause these additional negative health effects:
Convulsions (muscle shaking)
Loss of consciousness
Paralysis
Respiratory (breathing) failure possibly leading to death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to soman.
Exposure
Soman can have a camphor or fruity smell. However, the smell may not be noticeable or strong enough to give people enough of a warning.
If soman is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact or by breathing it in. Because soman vapor (gas) is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase chances of exposure there.
Soman mixes easily with water, so it could be used to poison water. If soman is in the water, people can be exposed by drinking the water or getting the water on their skin.
If soman is in food, people can be exposed by eating the food. A person's clothes can also release soman if it touched soman gas, which can expose other people.
What to do if you are exposed
Recovery from soman exposure is possible with treatment, but the antidotes (cure) must be used quickly (within minutes) to be effective. Therefore, the best thing to do is avoid exposure
Get away
Get fresh air by leaving the area where the soman was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chances of death from soman.
If the soman was released outdoors, move away from the area where the soman was released. Go to the highest ground possible, because soman is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If soman was released indoors, get out of the building.
When immediate care is needed
If you swallowed soman, do not force vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away.
If you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas.
Throw your clothes away
Put your clothing inside a plastic bag. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.
Wash your body
Wash any soman from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
Keep Reading:
About Getting Clean
Treatment
Treatment involves removing soman from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital setting.
Antidotes (cures) are available for soman. They are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure. Clinicians should treat suspected cases based on the situation and should not wait for laboratory confirmation.
Long-term health effects
Mildly exposed people usually recover completely.
Severely exposed people are not likely to survive.

Orf Virus (Sore Mouth Infection)
EXPLORE TOPICS

MAY 13, 2024
About Orf Virus (Sore Mouth Disease)
KEY POINTS
Sore mouth disease or ""orf"" mostly affects sheep and goats.
People can get it too if they have contact with infected animals.
People get painful sores and also sometimes have a fever or other symptoms.
People and animals usually recover without long-term effects.
What it is
Sore mouth disease is caused by orf virus, a type of poxvirus. It occurs worldwide, anywhere sheep, goats and similar animals live.
People can get painful sores called lesions if they have contact with animals infected with orf virus. Certain activities like feeding, petting and getting bitten by infected animals put people more at risk for infection.
Simple prevention steps can protect people from the virus, even if they are handling infected animals infected with orf.
Signs and symptoms
An animal infected with orf virus typically has sores (lesions) around its lips and muzzle and in its mouth.
People infected with orf virus usually get sores or nodules on their hands or forearms. This rash is infectious, meaning it can spread to areas of a person's body if they scratch or touch the sores. The sores progress through stages over six weeks. They may also have mild fever, tiredness or swelling of the glands in their neck and underarms (lymph nodes).
People with weakened immune systems can develop more serious symptoms if they get infected with orf virus. They may have multiple sores or large tumor-like sores. They may also develop a second type of rash that isn't infectious (called erythema multiforme).
How it spreads
People can get sore mouth disease if they have a cut or abrasion and touch an animal with orf virus. People can also get orf by handling equipment used with sick animals.
Activities that may put people at more risk for infection include:
Bottle feeding, tube feeding or shearing sheep or goats
Petting or having casual contact with the sores of infected animals
Handling infected animal equipment such as a harness
Being bitten by an infected animal.
Orf virus does not spread between people.
People can get infected with orf virus multiple times. Infections after the first one are usually less severe and may heal faster.
Reducing risk
Wear rubber or latex gloves when handling sheep or goats. This is especially important if you have cuts on your hands or are touching an animal's mouth or muzzle.
Wash your hands often with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially if they look dirty. If there is no soap and your hands aren't visibly dirty, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Testing
CDC offers a test that can determine if your sores are caused by orf virus. Healthcare providers or health departments can send lesion specimens to CDC for testing. More information is available in the CDC test directory. CDC also has tools to help with diagnosis and can be reached at (404) 639-4129.
Members of the public should contact their healthcare provider or county/state health department for more information.
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific treatment to cure orf virus infection. But it's important to protect the sores from getting infected with other germs.
Keep the sores dry and covered with a bandage. Use a bandage that keeps water out when working with animals or doing manual labor. If your sores are dry at bedtime, keep them uncovered while you sleep. If they are wet, cover sores loosely with a bandage. This will help them heal faster.
See your doctor if you have pain, fever or if your sores are getting bigger or spreading. If this occurs, it could mean your sores are due to a different, more serious germ. Your doctor can help determine what's going on.

Sore Throat Basics
KEY POINTS
Is it painful to swallow? Or is your throat scratchy? A virus may be causing your sore throat.
Most sore throats are caused by viruses.
Most sore throats, except for strep throat, do not need antibiotics.
Overview
Viruses, like those that cause colds or flu, are the most common cause of sore throat. These viruses are not strep throat. Sore throat can be a symptom of strep throat, the common cold, allergies or other upper respiratory tract illness. Most sore throats will get better on their own within one week.
A healthy throat and a sore throat, including uvula and tongue, showing inflamed tonsils.
Signs and symptoms
Painful to swallow.
Dry and scratchy throat.
Sore throat caused by a virus or the bacteria called group A Streptococcus can have similar symptoms. Sometimes the following symptoms suggest a virus is causing the illness instead of strep throat:
Cough
Runny nose
Hoarseness (changes in your voice that make it sound breathy, raspy, or strained)
Conjunctivitis (also called pink eye)
Visit the Strep Throat webpage for more information on symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of strep throat.
Causes
Viruses, like those that cause colds or flu, are the most common cause of sore throat. These viruses are not strep throat.
Other causes of sore throat include:
The bacteria group A Streptococcus, which causes strep throat (also called streptococcal pharyngitis).
Allergies.
Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.
Prevention
You can help prevent sore throat by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including:
Clean your hands.
Avoid close contact with people who have sore throats, colds or other upper respiratory infections.
Don't smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.
When to seek medical care
Talk to your healthcare provider if you or your child have symptoms of sore throat. They may need to test you or your child for strep throat.
Also, see a healthcare provider if you or your child have any of the following:
Difficulty breathing.
Difficulty swallowing.
Blood in saliva or phlegm.
Excessive drooling (in young children).
Dehydration.
Joint swelling and pain.
Rash.
Symptoms that do not improve within a few days or get worse.
This list is not all-inclusive. Please see your healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning. Tell your healthcare provider if you or your child have recurrent sore throats.
Talk to your healthcare provider right away
If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider will determine what type of illness you have by asking about symptoms and doing a physical examination. Sometimes they will also swab your throat.
Treatment
If a virus causes a sore throat, antibiotics will not help. Most sore throats will get better on their own within one week. Your healthcare provider may prescribe other medicine or give you tips to help you feel better.
When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.
How to feel better
Suck on ice chips, popsicles or lozenges (do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years).
Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.
Gargle with salt water.
Drink warm beverages and plenty of fluids.
Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older.
Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed.
Over-the-counter medicine and children
Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Some over-the-counter medicines are not recommended for children of certain ages.
Pain relievers:
Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen.
Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye’s syndrome. Reye’s syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain.
Cough and cold medicines:
Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children.
Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child’s healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child.
Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking.

About Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness
KEY POINTS
STARI is characterized by a red, expanding lesion that develops around the site of a lone star tick bite.
The STARI rash is very similar to the Lyme disease rash. Though, it occurs most often in the Southern U.S., where Lyme disease is rare.
The cause of STARI is unknown.
Overview
A rash similar to the rash of Lyme disease has been described in humans following bites of the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum. The rash may be accompanied by fatigue, fever, headache, muscle and joint pains. This condition has been named southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI). The cause of STARI is not known, but studies have excluded Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, as its cause.
Signs and symptoms
The rash of STARI is a red, expanding lesion that develops around the site of a lone star tick bite. The rash usually appears within 7 days of tick bite and expands to a diameter of 3 inches (8 centimeters) or more, sometimes clearing as it enlarges to produce a target or ""bull's-eye"" appearance.
The rash should not be confused with much smaller areas of redness and discomfort that can occur commonly at the site of any tick bite. Patients may also experience fatigue, headache, fever, and muscle pains. The saliva from lone star ticks can be irritating; redness and discomfort at a bite site does not necessarily indicate an infection.
STARI rashes take many forms.
Causes
STARI is specifically associated with bites of Amblyomma americanum, known commonly as the lone star tick. Lone star ticks can be found from central Texas and Oklahoma eastward across the southern states and along the Atlantic coast as far north as Maine. The adult female is distinguished by a white dot or ""lone star"" on her back. All three life stages of A. americanum aggressively bite people.
Lone Star Tick Distribution, 2011
Lone star ticks have not been shown to transmit Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease. In fact, their saliva has been sho...
Show More
Diagnosis
STARI is diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, geographic location, and possibility of tick bite. Because the cause of STARI is unknown, no diagnostic blood tests have been developed. Researchers once hypothesized that STARI was caused by the spirochete, Borrelia lonestari; however, further research did not support this idea.
Treatment
It is not known whether antibiotic treatment is necessary or beneficial for patients with STARI. Nevertheless, because STARI resembles early Lyme disease, physicians will often treat patients with oral antibiotics.

Rat-bite Fever (RBF)
EXPLORE TOPICS

JULY 9, 2024
About Rat Bite Fever (RBF)
KEY POINTS
Rat-bite fever (RBF) is an infectious disease people can get from contact with rodents.
Anyone can get RBF, but having pet rodents or working with rodents may increase your risk.
If you have RBF symptoms and had recent contact with rodents, see a healthcare provider immediately.
RBF must be treated quickly, or it can cause severe illness and possibly death.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Anyone can get RBF if they have contact with rodents infected with the bacteria that cause RBF. Certain groups of people are more at risk for this serious and sometimes deadly disease.
The rodents that carry RBF include rats, mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, and squirrels. The bacteria that cause RBF is part of the natural germs in these rodents' bodies. Rodents that are carrying the bacteria that cause RBF do not show signs of illness, so it's not possible to tell if a rodent carries the bacteria just by looking at it.
If you know you were bitten or scratched by a rodent, and you develop symptoms consistent with RBF, you should seek medical care immediately. The infection is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. Getting treatment with the right antibiotics is important to keep the disease from progressing.
Thankfully, RBF is rare in the United States. But you should know many of these rodents that can carry it are popular pets, which can put people at risk. People who work in pet stores or labs with rodents also could be at higher risk.
Symptoms
The early symptoms of RBF can be like the flu. If you were infected by contact with rodents in North America, symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. About half of people will also have joint pain or swelling, and 3 in 4 will develop a rash.
Symptoms usually begin 3 to 10 days after your contact with rodents. They can appear up to 21 days after the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard to remember you were bitten.
Within 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear on the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or more joints may then become swollen, red, or painful.
The bacteria that cause RBF in Asia can be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by contact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, swelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of RBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health.
Complications
Complications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system.
Early treatment with antibiotics is important to try to prevent complications of RBF. These complications can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. These complications are rare but can be very serious and even deadly.
How it spreads
RBF can spread to people through scratches, bites, or contact with a rodent's saliva or pee. It can also spread by having contact with contaminated materials (rat bedding, cages, etc.), kissing pet rats, or eating or drinking contaminated food or drinks. RBF transmission does not necessarily require contact with rodents.
If you have pet rodents or handle rodents as feed for snakes/reptiles, you can be at increased risk for RBF. Other at risk include people who work at pet stores or laboratories where they may have contact with rodents.
Although rare, some animals like dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits can be infected by contact with infected rodents and then pass the infection on to people. People usually start to show signs they are sick 3-10 days after exposure. RBF cannot spread between people.
Prevention
You can lower your risk for RBF by avoiding contact with rodents, places with rodent infestations, or other areas where rodents may be present.
Although RBF is rare, it is important to take precautions and practice good hygiene when handling or coming into contact with rodents or potentially contaminated materials.
If you have pet rodents, handle rodents as feed for reptiles, or work with rodents in a pet store or laboratory, protect yourself from RBF by following CDC's small mammal guidance.
Quick facts
Quick facts
If you think you might have RBF, you should see your doctor immediately
Treatment and recovery
If you develop signs or symptoms of RBF, immediately contact a healthcare provider. Make sure to tell your provider about your contact with rodents.
Antibiotics can cure the disease if treatment is started soon after you become sick. It is important that you follow your healthcare provider's instructions. Take all of the medicine prescribed to you, even if you start to feel better.
These courses of treatment are very effective but if for some reason your symptoms worsen, see your health care provider immediately.

MAY 8, 2024
Spirometry Training Program
WHAT TO KNOW
The NIOSH Spirometry Training Program is responsible for approving course sponsors to train participants on how to perform spirometry, a lung function test. Various federal regulations require that individuals with NIOSH-approved spirometry training perform spirometry testing on workers exposed to certain work hazards including cotton, coal, and silica dusts.
NIOSH-approved courses
Various federal regulations require spirometry technicians performing spirometry as part of certain mandated health surveillance programs to have completed NIOSH-approved spirometry training courses. Examples include standards for:
Cotton dust [29 CFR 1910.1043(h)(1)(iii)
]
Respirable coal mine dust [42 CFR 37.95
]
Respirable crystalline silica in general industry and maritime [29 CFR 1910.1053(i)(2)(iv)
]
Respirable crystalline silica in Construction [29 CFR 1926.1153(h)(2)(iv)
]
NIOSH-approved spirometry training courses are also widely accepted for training healthcare professionals in other occupational settings. The purpose of NIOSH-approved courses is to gain knowledge and practical skills for collecting accurate and valid spirometry results.
For information on becoming a course sponsor, technical director, or faculty member, go to How to Get Involved.
Course types
New participants start by taking initial training (a minimum of 16 hours of course instruction). Sponsors offer 2–3-day courses. Initial courses adhere to a 1:6 student to practicum instructor ratio, as well as a 1:6 student to spirometer ratio.
On-line and 1-day refresher courses are available for participants who have already successfully completed the initial training. Refresher courses last 1-day (minimum of 7 hours).
Registration costs vary depending on the type of course, the sponsor, and geographical location. Currently scheduled courses, dates, and locations are located on the course schedule page and the course map.
Advanced spirometry training
NIOSH does not offer advanced training in spirometry testing. However, two NIOSH-approved sponsors offer physicians’ training for spirometry. Information about their training can be found at:
Web-Based Spirometry Training for Physicians
Interpretation of Spirometry: Beyond the Numbers
Certification
Students who successfully complete a NIOSH-approved spirometry training course will receive a certificate from the course sponsor. Certification does not mean you are ""NIOSH certified."" Rather, it means you passed a NIOSH-approved course.
Certificates are awarded to students for successfully completing a class. They are not transferable to any organization, company, or institution that may have provided financial assistance or reimbursement.
Expiration
Course certificates are valid for 5 years. There is a 7-month grace period allowed after the initial training course 5-year expiration. After 5 years and 7 months, technicians must retake an initial 2- or 3-day course to continue testing under those regulations. It is highly recommended that technicians attend refresher courses well in advance of certificate expiration.
State Certifications
State medical boards determine specific requirements for performing clinical testing in their states. Some state medical board requirements cover only diagnostic testing, such as in hospitals or clinics. Others may also cover occupational disease surveillance in private companies. Contact your state medical board for further information.
The National Board for Respiratory Care
provides respiratory therapists with certification for performing pulmonary function testing. This includes spirometry and other more complex tests. Certification candidates must meet minimum education and clinical experience requirements before they can take an examination.
Companies that hire occupational medicine staff usually provide minimum training requirements in their job announcements. These requirements should be carefully considered before expending resources to apply for a position.

FUNGAL DISEASES
APRIL 24, 2024
Sporotrichosis Basics
KEY POINTS
Sporotrichosis is a severe skin infection caused by the fungus Sporothrix that lives in soil and plants.
It is considered a neglected tropical disease and causes devastating health and economic problems in some tropical and subtropical areas.
In the U.S., most infections are caused by contact with plant matter.
In South America, a type of the fungus, Sporothrix brasiliensis (S. brasiliensis), is spreading from cats to people.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Sporotrichosis (""rose gardener's disease"") is a fungal skin infection caused by Sporothrix, a fungus that lives in soil and on plants. It affects both people and animals.
People get infected when Sporothrix gets in cuts or scrapes. For example, infections can be caused by pricks from rose thorns or scratches from an infected cat. Cat-associated sporotrichosis is a growing global public health concern.
Usually, sporotrichosis causes severe skin infections. Less commonly, it can cause eye or lung infections. Very rarely, the infection can spread to other parts of the body.
Sporotrichosis is listed by the World Health Organization
as a neglected tropical disease. It is found worldwide, but most cases are among impoverished communities and causes devastating health, social, and economic consequences.
For Health Care Providers
Clinical Overview of Sporotrichosis
Types and strains
Sporothrix schenckii
Sporothrix schenckii (S. schenckii) is the most common species of Sporothrix in the U.S.. Most infections with S. schenckii are caused by contact with plants. Rarely, this strain can spread from animals to humans.
Sporothrix brasiliensis
In South America, the most common species is Sporothrix brasiliensis (S. brasilliensis). Unlike most cases of S. schenckii, most people get infected with S. brasiliensis through contact with infected cats. Infections with S. brasiliensis tend to be more severe than infections with other Sporothrix species. There have not been any reported spread of S. brasiliensis in the U.S. to date.
In South America a type of sporotrichosis spreads from cats to people.
Symptoms
The symptoms of sporotrichosis depend on how and where the fungus gets into the body. Most infections are through the skin. Symptoms start anytime from 1 to 12 weeks after exposure.
Types of infection and symptoms include
Cutaneous (skin) - Starts as a small painless red, purple, or pink bump on the skin. Over time, more bumps may start to appear and grow larger. Eventually they may start to pus, become open sores, and spread up the arm or from the infection site.
Ocular (eye) - Redness of the eye, redness or swelling of the eyelid, eye pain, and possible vision changes.
Pulmonary (lung) - Cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever.
Disseminated sporotrichosis - Occurs when the infection spreads to another part of the body (i.e., bones, joints, or central nervous system).
Disseminated infections typically only affect people with weakened immune systems. Risk factors include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol use disorder, or HIV.
Risk factors
Contact with plant matter increases risk for infection. This includes activities and occupations that involve gardening, forestry work, and baling hay.
In areas where cat-transmitted sporotrichosis is spreading, veterinarians and people who provide care for or own cats are most at risk.
Sporotrichosis is not the same thing as cat-scratch disease, which is a bacterial illness spread by cats.
Causes and spread
People can get sporotrichosis from the environment or animals.
Sporotrichosis spread is a One Health issue involving humans, animals, and the environment.
Plants and environment
The fungus that causes sporotrichosis, Sporothrix, lives in the environment on soil and plants like sphagnum moss, rose bushes, and hay. People can get infected if they have contact with soil or plants where the fungus is found.
Cats and other animals
Animals can also get sporotrichosis from contact with soil or plants. Cats can transmit sporotrichosis to humans, cats, and other animals through bites or scratches, or even sneezes. People can also get eye infections by touching an infected cat and then touching their eyes. Very rarely, other animals like armadillos, rats, and dogs can also spread sporotrichosis to humans.
Infected animals can also contaminate the environment with Sporothrix through their feces, or if they die and are not cremated.
Prevention
To help prevent getting sporotrichosis:
Wear gloves, pants, and long sleeves when touching plant matter.
Avoid contact with cats with sores or wounds.
In areas where cat-associated sporotrichosis is common, cat owners should:
Limit interactions between domestic and feral cats.
Bring cats with signs of sporotrichosis to a veterinarian right away.
Inform the veterinarian of their cat's travel history
Even if the cat shows signs of sporotrichosis years after the travel.
Testing and diagnosis
To test for sporotrichosis, a healthcare provider may:
Examine a swab or scrape from a skin sore under a microscope.
Send a small tissue sample (biopsy) for lab testing.
Test fluid or discharge from lung or eyes.
Blood tests may help diagnose severe sporotrichosis, but usually can't diagnose skin infections.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment depends on the type of infection.
Skin sporotrichosis – several months of oral antifungal medication, like itraconazole or terbinafine or medications like supersaturated potassium iodide (SSKI).
Lung or disseminated sporotrichosis – at least a year of antifungal medication, including intravenous amphotericin B medicine and oral itraconazole. People with sporotrichosis in the lungs may also need surgery to cut away the infected tissue.

Usually, sporotrichosis causes severe skin infections. Less commonly, it can cause eye or lung infections. Very rarely, the infection can spread to other parts of the body.
Sporotrichosis is listed by the World Health Organization
as a neglected tropical disease. It is found worldwide, but most cases are among impoverished communities and causes devastating health, social, and economic consequences.
For Health Care Providers
Clinical Overview of Sporotrichosis
Types and strains
Sporothrix schenckii
Sporothrix schenckii (S. schenckii) is the most common species of Sporothrix in the U.S.. Most infections with S. schenckii are caused by contact with plants. Rarely, this strain can spread from animals to humans.
Sporothrix brasiliensis
In South America, the most common species is Sporothrix brasiliensis (S. brasilliensis). Unlike most cases of S. schenckii, most people get infected with S. brasiliensis through contact with infected cats. Infections with S. brasiliensis tend to be more severe than infections with other Sporothrix species. There have not been any reported spread of S. brasiliensis in the U.S. to date.
In South America a type of sporotrichosis spreads from cats to people.
Symptoms
The symptoms of sporotrichosis depend on how and where the fungus gets into the body. Most infections are through the skin. Symptoms start anytime from 1 to 12 weeks after exposure.
Types of infection and symptoms include
Cutaneous (skin) - Starts as a small painless red, purple, or pink bump on the skin. Over time, more bumps may start to appear and grow larger. Eventually they may start to pus, become open sores, and spread up the arm or from the infection site.
Ocular (eye) - Redness of the eye, redness or swelling of the eyelid, eye pain, and possible vision changes.
Pulmonary (lung) - Cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever.
Disseminated sporotrichosis - Occurs when the infection spreads to another part of the body (i.e., bones, joints, or central nervous system).
Disseminated infections typically only affect people with weakened immune systems. Risk factors include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcohol use disorder, or HIV.
Risk factors
Contact with plant matter increases risk for infection. This includes activities and occupations that involve gardening, forestry work, and baling hay.
In areas where cat-transmitted sporotrichosis is spreading, veterinarians and people who provide care for or own cats are most at risk.
Sporotrichosis is not the same thing as cat-scratch disease, which is a bacterial illness spread by cats.
Causes and spread
People can get sporotrichosis from the environment or animals.
Sporotrichosis spread is a One Health issue involving humans, animals, and the environment.
Plants and environment
The fungus that causes sporotrichosis, Sporothrix, lives in the environment on soil and plants like sphagnum moss, rose bushes, and hay. People can get infected if they have contact with soil or plants where the fungus is found.
Cats and other animals
Animals can also get sporotrichosis from contact with soil or plants. Cats can transmit sporotrichosis to humans, cats, and other animals through bites or scratches, or even sneezes. People can also get eye infections by touching an infected cat and then touching their eyes. Very rarely, other animals like armadillos, rats, and dogs can also spread sporotrichosis to humans.
Infected animals can also contaminate the environment with Sporothrix through their feces, or if they die and are not cremated.
Prevention
To help prevent getting sporotrichosis:
Wear gloves, pants, and long sleeves when touching plant matter.
Avoid contact with cats with sores or wounds.
In areas where cat-associated sporotrichosis is common, cat owners should:
Limit interactions between domestic and feral cats.
Bring cats with signs of sporotrichosis to a veterinarian right away.
Inform the veterinarian of their cat's travel history
Even if the cat shows signs of sporotrichosis years after the travel.
Testing and diagnosis
To test for sporotrichosis, a healthcare provider may:
Examine a swab or scrape from a skin sore under a microscope.
Send a small tissue sample (biopsy) for lab testing.
Test fluid or discharge from lung or eyes.
Blood tests may help diagnose severe sporotrichosis, but usually can't diagnose skin infections.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment depends on the type of infection.
Skin sporotrichosis – several months of oral antifungal medication, like itraconazole or terbinafine or medications like supersaturated potassium iodide (SSKI).
Lung or disseminated sporotrichosis – at least a year of antifungal medication, including intravenous amphotericin B medicine and oral itraconazole. People with sporotrichosis in the lungs may also need surgery to cut away the infected tissue.

Stalking
KEY POINTS
Stalking is a public health problem that affects millions of people in the United States.
Stalking can be prevented and resources are available to help.
Overview
Stalking involves a perpetrator's use of a pattern of harassing or threatening tactics. These tactics are unwanted and cause fear or safety concerns in a victim.
Stalking tactics can include:
Following and watching the victim.
Approaching or showing up in places like the victim's home or workplace.
Leaving strange or potentially threatening items for the victim to find.
Sneaking into the victim's home or car and doing things to scare the victim or let the victim know the perpetrator had been there.
Sending cards, letters, flowers, or other presents.
Using technology to communicate has its conveniences. However, it can also make it easier for people to harass others in ways that might be frightening and threatening. Other stalking tactics can include:
Using technology (e.g., camera, computer software) to spy on the victim from a distance.
Using GPS technology to track the victim’s location.
Contacting the victim via phone calls (including hang-ups and voicemails), texts, email, social media, or photo messages.
Quick facts and stats
About one in three women and one in six men have been stalked at some point in their lives.1
Most stalking victims reported first experiencing stalking in adulthood. However, about 24% of female victims and 19% of male victims reported being stalked as minors.1
Nearly 58% of female victims and 49% of male victims experienced stalking before the age of 25.1
Outcomes
Stalking victims have reported feeling fearful, threatened, or concerned for their safety or the safety of others. Nearly 69% of female and 80% of male victims experienced threats of physical harm from the stalker during their lifetime.1 Research has shown a relationship between stalking victimization and posttraumatic stress symptoms, feelings of hopelessness, depression, and anxiety.2345
Stalking victims usually know their stalkers. Data shows that the most common perpetrators were intimate partners or acquaintances for both female and male victims.1
Prevention
It is important for everyone to work together to end stalking. Findings from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey highlight the importance of early prevention and support efforts. These efforts can include:
Empowering everyone to understand, recognize, and address stalking.
Mobilizing men and boys as allies in prevention efforts.
Enacting programs and policies that promote healthy relationships and safe environments.

Staphylococcus aureus Basics
KEY POINTS
Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is a type of germ that about 30% of people carry in their noses.
Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm, but it can sometimes cause infections.
Some types of Staphylococcus aureus are resistant to common antibiotic treatments.
Overview
Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time staph does not cause any harm, but it can sometimes cause infections. In healthcare settings, infections can lead to serious or fatal outcomes.
Signs and symptoms
Staph infections can look like pimples, boils or other skin conditions.
In healthcare settings, staph infections can be serious or fatal, leading to:
Bloodstream infections or sepsis when bacteria get in the bloodstream.
Pneumonia, which most often affects people with underlying lung disease, including those on mechanical ventilators.
Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), which can lead to heart failure or stroke.
Osteomyelitis (bone infection), caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as trauma (puncture wound of the foot).
Risk factors
In the community, people are at greater risk of staph infections if they have chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, etc.) or inject drugs.
In health care, the risk of more serious staph infection is higher for patients:
In intensive care units (ICUs).
Who have undergone certain types of surgeries.
With medical devices inserted in their bodies.
With weakened immune symptoms.
Causes
Several different types of staph can cause infections, including:
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)
Vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA)
Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA)
Although MRSA is often better known, any staph infection can be dangerous, even if it is not resistant to antibiotics.
Reducing risk
Patients can avoid sharing items that contact skin, such as towels, razors and needles, and can also follow safety tips to reduce their risk of staph infection.
Treatment and recovery
Healthcare providers can treat most staph infections with antibiotics.
What CDC is doing
Providing testing to identify antimicrobial resistance cases, measure resistance and track transmission in a healthcare setting through the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network.
Tracking staph infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by staph and slow the spread of resistant germs.

About Staph Food Poisoning
HIGHLIGHTS
Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) are bacteria.
Many people carry Staph on their skin and in their nose.
Staph can spread from unwashed hands and contaminate food.
After getting in food, Staph can multiply and make a toxin that causes food poisoning.
Overview
Staph food poisoning is a gastrointestinal illness. It is caused by toxins made by Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) bacteria.
About 1 in every 4 people and animals carries (has) Staph on their skin and in their nose. Staph usually do not cause illness in healthy people who carry it, but the bacteria have the ability to make toxins that can cause food poisoning.
Keep in mind
This page focuses on Staph food poisoning. You also can learn about Staph infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staph infections in healthcare settings.
Symptoms
Symptoms of Staph food poisoning include:
Nausea
Vomiting
Stomach cramps
Diarrhea
Symptoms usually start suddenly within 30 minutes to 8 hours after eating contaminated food. They last 24 hours or less.
Severe illness is rare.
Risk factors
Foods that are not cooked after handling are especially risky if contaminated with Staph. These foods include sliced meats, puddings, pastries, and sandwiches.
Foods that are cooked also can be risky if held at unsafe temperatures
(between 40°F and 140°F). Even though cooking can kill Staph, it does not destroy the toxin in the food.
How it spreads
Staph can contaminate food if people who carry the bacteria touch food without first washing their hands. Staph can multiply in contaminated food and make a toxin that causes food poisoning.
You can take steps to prevent Staph food poisoning.
Testing and diagnosis
Laboratory tests can detect toxin-producing Staph in stool, vomit, and foods. However, these tests are usually not ordered except during an outbreak.
If you have severe symptoms, contact your healthcare provider.
Your healthcare provider might suspect you have Staph food poisoning based on your symptoms and how soon they go away.
Treatment
Fluids
People with vomiting or diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Dehydration is not having enough water in the body.
People with severe illness may require intravenous (IV) fluids.
Medications
Talk to your healthcare provider about medication to help with nausea and vomiting, if needed.
Antibiotics are not used to treat Staph food poisoning because they do not affect the toxin.

JANUARY 9, 2025
About the Prevention Effectiveness Fellowship
KEY POINTS
CDC's Steven M. Teutsch Prevention Effectiveness (PE) Fellowship is a two-year post-doctoral research fellowship focusing on health economics, decision science, and disease modeling.
This fellowship offers a Traditional Track and Analytics and Modeling Track.
The fellowship builds CDC's ability to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions and evidence-based decision-making.
Overview
The CDC Steven M. Teutsch Prevention Effectiveness (PE) Fellowship is a two-year, post-doctoral, applied training fellowship. It addresses public health demand for quantitative policy analysis, health economics-based inquiry, integrative health services research, and rigorous decision modeling.
The Traditional Track is offered for economists and health services researchers. The Analytics and Modeling Track is intended for disease modelers, ecologists, operations researchers, industrial engineers, and applied mathematicians.
Since 1995, CDC has recruited and trained effective decision scientists through the fellowship. With each new class, the PE Fellowship builds a cadre of scientists whose research provides vital information to decision makers. CDC, congress, and nongovernmental agencies use information on resource allocation to maximize the impact of public health programs.
What is prevention effectiveness?
Prevention effectiveness uses econometrics, decision science, simulation, operations analysis and modeling. The purpose is to understand determinants of health; morbidity and mortality; health inequalities and disparities; the cost of public health services and preventive interventions; the burden of illnesses; impact of regulations on population health; and ways to optimize resources for public health.

Arsine
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Arsine is a toxic gas that is colorless, flammable, and non-irritating.
Signs and symptoms of arsine poisoning depend on exposure method and dose.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Arsine is a colorless, flammable, non-irritating toxic gas with a mild garlic odor. Arsine is formed when arsenic comes in contact with an acid.
Arsine is similar to a gas called stibine, which is formed when the metal antimony comes in contact with an acid. Stibine has health effects similar to those of arsine, but it is not as widely available. Stibine also has a noticeable ""rotten egg"" smell.
Where it is found
Arsine is most commonly used in the semiconductor and metals refining industries.
Arsine was studied as a warfare agent during World War II, but it was never used on the battlefield.
How it works
After arsine enters the bloodstream, it damages the red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms of hemolytic anemia, when red blood cells die faster than the body can replace them.
Signs and symptoms
The effects of arsine poisoning depend on how much arsine a person was exposed to and how long the exposure was.
Depending on the level of exposure to arsine, symptoms are likely to occur within the first 24 hours after exposure.
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to arsine.
Exposure to low or moderate dose:
Confusion, drowsiness, fatigue, and/or weakness
Headache
Muscle cramps
Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain
Rapid breathing or shortness of breath
Red or dark urine
Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice)
Exposure to a large dose:
Convulsions
Loss of consciousness
Paralysis
Respiratory compromise, possibly leading to death
Exposure
Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after arsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the skin.
At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it has no smell. At higher amounts, a mild garlic smell (however, do not rely on this as a warning). On the other hand, stibine has a strong smell, so people may notice that they may have been exposed.
Most reports of exposure are when arsine is accidentally made in the workplace. Arsine gas is heavier than air, so it would be more likely to settle in lower areas.
What to do if you are exposed
Because there is no cure for arsine exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it.
First, get fresh air by leaving the area where the arsine is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from arsine.
If arsine was released outside, move away from the area. If arsine was released indoors, get out of the building.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near an arsine release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Evacuation.""
For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Sheltering in Place.""
When immediate care is needed
If you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any arsine from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.
For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit ""About Getting Clean.""
Treatment
Treatment involves providing supportive medical care in a hospital. Blood transfusions (transferring blood) and intravenous fluids (fluids injected directly into a vein) may be needed.
Some people may need to have their blood cleaned by a machine if their kidneys fail. This process is called dialysis.
Long-term health effects
If people survive the first exposure, long-term effects may include:
Kidney damage
Numbness and pain in the hands and feet
Neuropsychological symptoms (memory loss, confusion, and irritability)

About Still Going Strong
KEY POINTS
The Still Going Strong campaign educates about common risk factors for injuries as we age and empowers older adults and their caregivers to prevent these injuries.
Getting older doesn't have to mean giving up the activities you enjoy!
About the campaign
Still Going Strong
CDC's Still Going Strong campaign speaks directly to older adults, ages 65 and older, and their caregivers. We want to raise awareness about the importance of preventing injuries and staying connected to maintain optimal health as we age. This campaign has two goals:
Educate about common risk factors for falls and motor vehicle crashes, as well as traumatic brain injuries that happen from falls and motor vehicle crashes.
Empower older adults and their caregivers to take simple steps that will help them stay connected, maintain their independence, and age without injury.
Getting older doesn't have to mean giving up the activities you enjoy!
In 2021, CDC focused ads in both metro and rural markets in four states: Maine, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Wisconsin. In 2024, there will be focused ads in Colorado, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Washington; in addition to tribal-specific ads in Arizona, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. States were selected based on the number of injuries and injury-related deaths common in older adults such as falls, car crashes, and traumatic brain injuries. The campaign also has national reach through social media, media coverage, and partner efforts.

About Stillbirth
KEY POINTS
Stillbirth is more common than people may realize and remains a sad reality for many families.
If you’re pregnant and you experience something that seems unusual or is worrying you, talk to your healthcare provider.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
A stillbirth is when a fetus dies in the uterus after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Stillbirth is different from miscarriage. In the United States, a miscarriage is usually defined as the loss of a fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy.
Stillbirth is further classified as early, late, or term:
Early is the loss of a fetus between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy.
Late is the loss of a fetus between 28 and 36 weeks of pregnancy.
Term is the loss of a fetus at 37 or more weeks of pregnancy.
CDC works to learn why stillbirths happen and what more can be done.
Who is at risk
Stillbirth occurs in families of all races, ethnicities, and income levels, and to women of all ages. However, stillbirth occurs more commonly among certain groups of people including women who
Are 35 years of age or older
Are of low socioeconomic status
Smoke cigarettes during pregnancy
Have certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure
Are pregnant with more than one baby (such as twins or triplets)
Have had a stillbirth in the past
Stillbirths also occur more often to women in certain racial or ethnic groups. In 2020, stillbirth occurred among non-Hispanic Black women two times more often than among non-Hispanic White and Asian or Pacific Islander women.12
Health disparities in stillbirth are not rooted in biological or genetic differences between races and ethnicities. These disparities can be attributed to many underlying causes, including access to quality health care, pre-existing health conditions, and structural discrimination. Investigating these disparities is an important part of creating programs to reduce them.
Adrian's story
My son Adrian was stillborn due to complications from undiagnosed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition that can happen after 20 weeks of pregnancy. No one mentioned the risk of stillbirth, and none of my providers seemed concerned about my symptoms. The night before I hit my 41st week of pregnancy, I went to bed with my son actively kicking in my belly. By the time I woke up the following morning, he was dead. I wish I had known stillbirth is as common as it is. I wish I had known that having symptoms of preeclampsia was a big deal. Most of all, I wish more people talked about stillbirth. My son should be here, and he isn't.
What CDC is doing
CDC works to learn more about who had a stillbirth and explores whether we know why. CDC does this by tracking how often stillbirth occurs and researching what causes stillbirth. Knowledge about the potential causes of stillbirth can be used to develop recommendations, policies, and services to help prevent stillbirth. While we continue to learn more about stillbirth, much work remains.

About Stop Overdose
KEY POINTS
Through preliminary research and strategic workshops, CDC identified four areas of focus to address the evolving drug overdose crisis.
Stop Overdose resources speak to the reality of drug use, provide practical ways to prevent overdoses, educate about the risks of illegal drug use, and show ways to get help.
Overview
Drugs take nearly 300 lives every day.1 To address the increasing number of overdose deaths related to both prescription opioids and illegal drugs, we created a website to educate people who use drugs about the dangers of illegally manufactured fentanyl, the risks and consequences of mixing drugs, the lifesaving power of naloxone, and the importance of reducing stigma around recovery and treatment options. Together, we can stop drug overdoses and save lives.

Strategic Foresight at NIOSH
EXPLORE TOPICS

JANUARY 9, 2024
Strategic Foresight at NIOSH
KEY POINTS
Strategic Foresight is a discipline that creates a structured way of exploring and preparing for the future.
NIOSH has developed a Foresight Framework for Occupational Safety and Health.
Foresight Friday @NIOSH webinars connect foresight practice to occupational safety and health.
Overview
Strategic foresight is an action-oriented discipline related to futures studies. The practice of strategic foresight does not predict the future. Instead, it looks ahead and asks:
what may be coming
how it might affect us
what we can do today to prepare for the future
Exploring these questions can help us start moving toward a preferred future outcome.
Developing scenarios of the future is a useful tool to help identify key uncertainties and strategic issues that we can consider when planning and preparing for the future. Foresight professionals use a number of different tools to:
Look for signals of change
Identify primary drivers of the future
Craft a set of well informed, plausible future scenarios
Identify key strategic issues and action plans
The forward-facing view of foresight can enhance strategic planning during periods of complexity, instability, or uncertainty. Foresight helps identify early signals of changes that may be coming. Having early insight into these changes can reduce the likelihood of being unprepared for or surprised by them when they arrive in the future.
Foresight Framework
The NIOSH Foresight Framework for Occupational Safety and Health is an adaptation of the Framework Foresight method developed by the University of Houston.1 This flexible approach provides a clear roadmap through the foresight process and provides a useful structure for exploring a variety of project topics and aims.
The Framework has six linked and interrelated stages:
Framing: identifying and describing the OSH domain or topic of interest and other project parameters.
Scanning: searching a variety of sources for information about how things might be different in the future for the domain of interest.
Futuring: developing alternative future scenarios (i.e., stories) for the domain.
Visioning: considering the implications of the different scenarios to uncover potential risks, challenges, and opportunities and assess future preparedness.
Designing: planning and constructing strategic approaches in support of a desired future.
Monitoring: continuing to scan for new signals of change and updating the domain frame as needed for future foresight efforts.
Contacts
Please direct any questions about strategic foresight to the NIOSH Office of Research Integration (ORI@cdc.gov).

About Group A Strep Infection
KEY POINTS
Group A Streptococcus (group A strep bacteria) can cause many different infections.
These infections range from minor to serious.
Group A strep bacteria can also cause inflammatory diseases.
Group A strep bacteria are contagious.
Generally, people spread the bacteria to others through respiratory droplets or direct contact.
What it is
Group A Streptococcus are bacteria.
Types
Group A strep bacteria can cause many different types of infections that range from minor to serious. The bacteria can also cause inflammatory diseases.
The following are some, but not all, of the conditions associated with group A strep bacteria.
Minor infections
The following infections caused by group A strep bacteria are generally mild:
Impetigo
Scarlet fever
Strep throat
Serious infections
Three infections caused by group A strep bacteria can be very serious and even deadly:
Cellulitis
Necrotizing fasciitis
Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome
Inflammatory diseases
Long-term health issues related to group A strep bacteria include:
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
Rheumatic fever
Both are thought to be caused by an immune response to an earlier group A strep infection. As the body's defense system, the immune system is important in fighting off infections. But the immune system can mistakenly attack healthy parts of the body and cause damage.
Risk factors for serious infections
Who's at increased risk of getting any specific condition listed above varies. However, some people are generally at increased risk of getting a serious group A strep infection.
Viral infections, like flu or chickenpox, can increase this risk.
Medical conditions that can increase the risk for getting a serious group A strep infection include:
Cancer
Chronic heart, kidney, or lung disease
Diabetes
Immunocompromising condition (having a weakened immune system)
Wounds or skin disease
Other groups at increased risk for getting a serious group A strep infection include:
American Indian and Alaska Native populations
People aged 65 years or older
People who inject drugs or who are experiencing homelessness
Residents of long-term care facilities
How it spreads
Group A strep bacteria are very contagious. Some people infected with group A strep bacteria don't have symptoms or seem sick. They can still spread the bacteria to others.
Generally, people spread the bacteria to others through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Rarely group A strep bacteria can be spread through food that isn't handled properly.
Respiratory droplets
Group A strep bacteria often live in the nose and throat. People who are infected spread the bacteria by talking, coughing, or sneezing. This creates respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria.
People can get sick if they:
Breathe in respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria
Touch their mouth or nose after touching something with those droplets on it
Use the same plate, utensils, or glass as someone infected with the bacteria
Once washed, plates, utensils, and glasses are safe for others to use.
Direct contact
People can also spread group A strep bacteria from infected sores on the skin. Other people can get sick if they touch those sores or come into contact with fluid from the sores.
Once the sores heal, someone with impetigo usually isn't able to spread the bacteria to others.
Prevention
There are things people can do to protect themselves and others from group A strep infections.
Group A strep prevention activities vary by each disease, but generally focus on three important goals:
Limit exposure and spread of bacteria
Treat group A strep infections promptly
Use preventive antibiotics when appropriate

About Rat Bite Fever (RBF)
KEY POINTS
Rat-bite fever (RBF) is an infectious disease people can get from contact with rodents.
Anyone can get RBF, but having pet rodents or working with rodents may increase your risk.
If you have RBF symptoms and had recent contact with rodents, see a healthcare provider immediately.
RBF must be treated quickly, or it can cause severe illness and possibly death.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Anyone can get RBF if they have contact with rodents infected with the bacteria that cause RBF. Certain groups of people are more at risk for this serious and sometimes deadly disease.
The rodents that carry RBF include rats, mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, and squirrels. The bacteria that cause RBF is part of the natural germs in these rodents' bodies. Rodents that are carrying the bacteria that cause RBF do not show signs of illness, so it's not possible to tell if a rodent carries the bacteria just by looking at it.
If you know you were bitten or scratched by a rodent, and you develop symptoms consistent with RBF, you should seek medical care immediately. The infection is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. Getting treatment with the right antibiotics is important to keep the disease from progressing.
Thankfully, RBF is rare in the United States. But you should know many of these rodents that can carry it are popular pets, which can put people at risk. People who work in pet stores or labs with rodents also could be at higher risk.
Symptoms
The early symptoms of RBF can be like the flu. If you were infected by contact with rodents in North America, symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. About half of people will also have joint pain or swelling, and 3 in 4 will develop a rash.
Symptoms usually begin 3 to 10 days after your contact with rodents. They can appear up to 21 days after the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard to remember you were bitten.
Within 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear on the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or more joints may then become swollen, red, or painful.
The bacteria that cause RBF in Asia can be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by contact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, swelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of RBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health.
Complications
Complications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system.
Early treatment with antibiotics is important to try to prevent complications of RBF. These complications can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. These complications are rare but can be very serious and even deadly.
How it spreads
RBF can spread to people through scratches, bites, or contact with a rodent's saliva or pee. It can also spread by having contact with contaminated materials (rat bedding, cages, etc.), kissing pet rats, or eating or drinking contaminated food or drinks. RBF transmission does not necessarily require contact with rodents.
If you have pet rodents or handle rodents as feed for snakes/reptiles, you can be at increased risk for RBF. Other at risk include people who work at pet stores or laboratories where they may have contact with rodents.
Although rare, some animals like dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits can be infected by contact with infected rodents and then pass the infection on to people. People usually start to show signs they are sick 3-10 days after exposure. RBF cannot spread between people.
Prevention
You can lower your risk for RBF by avoiding contact with rodents, places with rodent infestations, or other areas where rodents may be present.
Although RBF is rare, it is important to take precautions and practice good hygiene when handling or coming into contact with rodents or potentially contaminated materials.
If you have pet rodents, handle rodents as feed for reptiles, or work with rodents in a pet store or laboratory, protect yourself from RBF by following CDC's small mammal guidance.
Quick facts
Quick facts
If you think you might have RBF, you should see your doctor immediately
Treatment and recovery
If you develop signs or symptoms of RBF, immediately contact a healthcare provider. Make sure to tell your provider about your contact with rodents.
Antibiotics can cure the disease if treatment is started soon after you become sick. It is important that you follow your healthcare provider's instructions. Take all of the medicine prescribed to you, even if you start to feel better.
These courses of treatment are very effective but if for some reason your symptoms worsen, see your health care provider immediately.

PARASITES 
SEPTEMBER 10, 2024
About Strongyloides
KEY POINTS
Strongyloides is a parasitic roundworm that infects people.
It can cause stomachaches, diarrhea, and rashes.
Most people have no symptoms, but people with immune disorders or taking drugs affecting immunity can get severely ill.
Antiparasitic drugs can treat severe cases of strongyloidiasis.
Overview
Strongyloides is a type of nematode or roundworm parasite. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. It can infect people through exposed skin, such as bare feet, and cause a disease called strongyloidiasis.
Strongyloidiasis can cause stomachaches, diarrhea, and rashes. Most people infected with Strongyloides have no symptoms and may not know they're infected. However, people who have weakened immune systems can become severely ill or die from strongyloidiasis if not treated.
Strongyloides is usually found in tropical regions, particularly Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. However, it can occur anywhere, especially in warm, wet, rural areas.
The best way to prevent Strongyloides infection is to wear shoes when you are walking on soil, avoid contact with fecal matter or sewage, and clean up after dogs. Use improved sanitation facilities, if available, to ensure people do not have contact with human waste.
Signs and symptoms
Most people infected with Strongyloides do not have any symptoms. But in people with more severe infection, symptoms may include:
Abdominal (belly) pain
Bloating
Heartburn
Occasional diarrhea and constipation
Skin rashes
Dry cough
In rare cases, strongyloidiasis can cause:
Arthritis
Kidney problems
Heart conditions
Strongyloidiasis can be severe or even life-threatening in people with immune disorders or who have health conditions that require them to take drugs that weaken their immune system (e.g., corticosteroids).
Risk factors
You are more likely to become infected with Strongyloides if you:
Travel to tropical regions, such as Southeast Asia and the South Pacific
Live in rural areas or areas with warm, wet climates
Live or work in agricultural settings
Use an unimproved sanitation facility (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact)
Live in long-term care facilities
How it spreads
Strongyloides infects people when they touch soil contaminated with young roundworms (larvae), which are too small to see without a microscope. The roundworms dig into your skin and spread through the body, settling in the small intestine, where they lay eggs.
Once the eggs hatch, most of the roundworms pass out of your body in your feces (poop). But some may mature and re-infect the body by digging into the walls of the intestine or anus.
Strongyloidiasis Lifecycle
CDC - DPDx - Strongyloidiasis
In rare cases, Strongyloides may also spread from person to person through:
Organ transplants
Facilities for people with cognitive disabilities, who need help with activities of daily living and personal hygiene
Long-term care facilities
Daycare centers
Prevention
The best way to prevent Strongyloides infection is to wear shoes when you are walking on soil, avoid contact with fecal matter or sewage, and clean up after dogs, which can also be infected with roundworm. It is also important to use improved sanitation facilities, if available, to ensure separation of human waste from human contact.
Diagnosis
If you have signs of strongyloidiasis, see a healthcare provider. Healthcare providers can identify Strongyloides infection with a blood test or by using a microscope to look for young roundworms in a sample of your stool (poop).
Treatment
If you have strongyloidiasis, your healthcare provider may prescribe drugs to kill the parasites, called antiparasitic drugs. You might need to take them for as little as 1 – 2 days. But if your infection has made you severely ill, you might have to take these drugs for several weeks.

Strychnine
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Only a little strychnine is needed to cause serious effects.
Signs and symptoms depend on the amount of strychnine and how someone was exposed.
Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed.
Do not force yourself to vomit or drink fluids if strychnine was swallowed.
Background
Strychnine is a strong poison. Only a small amount is needed to cause serious effects in people. Strychnine poisoning can cause extremely serious negative health effects, including death.
Strychnine is a white, odorless, bitter crystalline powder. It can be taken by mouth, breathed in, or mixed in a solution and given intravenously (injected directly into a vein).
Where it is found
The main natural source of strychnine is the plant Strychnos nux-vomica. This plant is found in southern Asia (India, Sri Lanka, and East Indies) and Australia.
In the past, strychnine was available in a pill form and was used to treat many human illnesses. Today, strychnine is used mainly as a pesticide, particularly to kill rats.
Uncommonly, strychnine is found mixed with ""street"" drugs such as LSD, heroin, and cocaine.
How it works
Strychnine stops the chemical that controls nerve signals to the muscles from working. The chemical controlling nerve signals works like the body's ""off switch"" for muscles. When this ""off switch"" does not work correctly, muscles throughout the body have severe, painful spasms.
The person's consciousness or thinking are not affected at first, except that the person is very excitable and in pain. However, eventually the muscles tire and the person can't breathe.
Signs and symptoms
The level of strychnine poisoning depends on the amount and how someone was exposed. It also depends on the person's health at the time of the exposure.
After swallowing strychnine, symptoms of poisoning usually appear within 15 to 60 minutes.
People exposed to a low or medium amount by any route of exposure will have the following signs or symptoms:
Agitation
Apprehension or fear
Ability to be easily startled
Restlessness
Painful muscle spasms possibly leading to fever or kidney and liver injury
Uncontrollable arching of the neck and back
Rigid arms and legs
Jaw tightness
Muscle pain and soreness
Difficulty breathing
Dark urine
Initial consciousness and awareness of symptoms
People exposed to high amounts may have the following signs and symptoms within the first 15 to 30 minutes of exposure:
Respiratory failure (trouble breathing), possibly leading to death
Brain death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to strychnine.
When immediate care is needed
If you think you swallowed strychnine, do not swallow more and call 911 immediately. Do not force yourself to vomit or drink fluids.
Exposure
Air
It is also possible to absorb strychnine through the nose, eyes, or mouth. For example, a person could be poisoned by breathing in strychnine powder that has been released in the air.
Drug
Strychnine could be smoked or snorted as a part of street drugs. Poisoning has been reported from strychnine given intravenously (in the vein) and through the nose.
Food and water
If strychnine is in water, you could be exposed by drinking the water. If strychnine is in food, you could be exposed by eating the food.
What to do if you are exposed
Recovery from strychnine exposure is possible with early hospital treatment. Therefore, the best thing to do is get medical care as quickly as possible.
Get away
If you think strychnine may have been released into the air, the best thing to do is get away from it.
If the strychnine release was indoors, get out of the building.
If the release was outdoors, move away from the area of the release. Stay upwind if possible and go to higher ground.
Quickly moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to lower the chance of death from strychnine.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a strychnine release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Evacuation.""
For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Sheltering in Place.""
Take your clothes off
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas and take off the clothing quickly.
Wash your body
Wash any strychnine from your skin with a lot of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.
For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, see ""About Getting Clean.""
When to seek emergency care
Seek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Treatment
Treatment involves removing the drug from the body (decontamination) and getting supportive medical care in a hospital setting. Supportive care includes giving:
Intravenous fluids (fluids injected directly into a vein)
Medications for convulsions (muscle shaking) and spasms
Cooling measures for high temperature
Long-term health effects
If the person survives the harmful effects of strychnine poisoning, long-term health effects are unlikely.
Examples of long-term effects include, but are not limited to, brain damage from low oxygen and kidney failure.
People strongly affected by strychnine poisoning are not likely to survive.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Vaccines
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS |
PAGE 8 OF 9 | ALL PAGES
KEY POINTS
SIDS is the sudden, unexpected death of a baby younger than 1 year of age that doesn’t have a known cause even after a complete investigation.
Multiple research studies and safety reviews have found that vaccines do not cause and are not linked to SIDS.
Overview
Babies receive multiple vaccines when they are between 2 to 4 months old. This age range is also the peak age for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The timing of the 2 month and 4 month shots and SIDS has led some people to question whether they might be related. However, studies have found that vaccines do not cause and are not linked to SIDS.
Multiple research studies and safety reviews have looked at possible links between vaccines and SIDS. The evidence accumulated over many years do not show any links between childhood immunization and SIDS.
Steps you can take
Fact
Placing healthy babies on their backs to sleep reduces the risk of SIDS.
In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that healthy babies be placed on their backs to sleep. That recommendation, along with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's 1994 ""Back-to-Sleep"" campaign (now known as the Safe to Sleep® campaign
), encouraged caregivers to place infants on their backs to sleep, and coincided with a dramatic reduction in the SIDS rate in the United States. See the latest recommendations on a safe infant sleep environment
from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Also, research has found the rate of SIDS declined dramatically following the 1994 ""Back-to-Sleep"" campaign, and then stabilized in the 2000s at a time when the number of infant immunizations was increasing. The findings provide strong evidence that immunization is not linked to SIDS. See the published article on SIDS rates.

Mustard Gas
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Sulfur mustard is a human-made chemical warfare agent that can cause skin blisters and damage to multiple parts of the body.
Usually, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
If sulfur mustard was swallowed, do not force vomiting.
Background
Sulfur mustard is a human-made chemical warfare agent that causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. This type of chemical warfare agent is called a vesicant or blistering agent.
Sulfur mustard is known as ""mustard gas,"" ""mustard agent,"" or by the military designation ""H"" or ""HD.""
Traits of mustard gas include:
Solid at less than 58° Fahrenheit
Oily-textured liquid at room temperature
Clear to yellow or brown when liquid or solid
Smells like garlic, onions, mustard, or no smell
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms depend on how the person was exposed, the amount of sulfur mustard, and how long they were exposed.
If you're in immediate danger
If sulfur mustard was swallowed, do not force vomiting.
Usually, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately. It may take up to 24 hours for some symptoms to occur. Sulfur mustard can have different effects on specific parts of the body.
Circulatory
Circulatory (heart and blood) signs and symptoms include decreased formation of blood cells and platelets. This can lead to weakness, bleeding, and infections.
Digestive
Digestive signs and symptoms include:
Diarrhea
Nausea
Vomiting
Eyes
Eye signs and symptoms include:
Eye irritation
Eye swelling
Eye pain
Eye tearing
Temporary blindness
Respiratory
Respiratory (breathing) signs and symptoms include:
Difficulty breathing
Cough
Shortness of breath
Sneezing
Wheezing
Hoarseness
Skin
Skin signs and symptoms include:
Blistering of skin, yellow in color
Skin itching
Skin pain
Skin redness
Other signs and symptoms include:
Abdominal pain
Bloody or runny nose
Sinus (nose) pain
Exposure to large amounts of sulfur mustard:
Convulsions (uncontrollable muscle shaking)
Light sensitivity
Insomnia (sleep disorder)
Permanent or temporary blindness
Respiratory (breathing) failure leading to death
Exposure
Sulfur mustard can last 1 to 2 days in the environment in average weather conditions. Sulfur mustard can last weeks to months in very cold conditions.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
Air
If sulfur mustard is in the air, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing it in. Because sulfur mustard gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase chances of exposure there. Do not stay in lower areas.
Clothes
If clothing touched sulfur mustard, people can be exposed by touching or breathing in sulfur mustard gas from the clothing.
Food
Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with sulfur mustard can expose people to sulfur mustard. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched sulfur mustard if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken and sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Water
If sulfur mustard is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the water. People can also be exposed by swallowing liquid sulfur mustard, getting it on their skin, or getting it in their eyes.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the sulfur mustard was released and breathe fresh air.
If the sulfur mustard release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the sulfur mustard does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the sulfur mustard was released.
If the sulfur mustard release was indoors, get out of the building and go to higher ground.
If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible. Sulfur mustard is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas.
Resource
Make sure you understand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency broadcasts and local authorities for instructions.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. Ideally, undress, blot, and shower immediately or as soon as you can, as described below. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take off your clothes
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the sulfur mustard from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
Follow these steps to blot your body:
Use different dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Start blotting with your head and hair.
Then blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds.
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with a lot of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds. Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10 to 15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch sulfur mustard. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.
Get help
Get help right away by:
Calling 911.
Going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave.
Calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.

Responding to Chemical Emergencies
Treatment
No known cure exists for sulfur mustard exposure.
Treatment involves removing sulfur mustard from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Supportive medical care can be given in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel.
Long-term health effects
Exposure to sulfur mustard usually does not often cause death. Sulfur mustard use during World War 1 killed fewer than 5% of the people who were exposed and got medical care.
Eye exposure may cause temporary or permanent eye injury or chronic (long-term) eye infections.
Skin exposure to sulfur mustard may cause the following long-term effects:
Second- and third-degree burns
Skin scarring
Pigment (color) changes
Skin cancer.
Breathing in sulfur mustard may cause the following long-term effects:
Loss of taste and smell
Chronic respiratory (breathing) disease
Repeated respiratory infections
Respiratory cancers

This is the first report issued by a federal agency to comprehensively review the public health issue of electronic cigarettes and their impact on our nation’s young people. The report highlights the rapidly changing patterns of e-cigarette use among youth and young adults, assesses what is known about the health effects of using these products, and describes strategies that tobacco companies use to recruit youth and young adults to try or continue using e-cigarettes. The report also outlines interventions that can be adopted to minimize the harm these products cause to our nation’s youth.
2014—The Health Consequences of Smoking: 50 Years of Progress
This report highlights the progress our nation has made reducing tobacco use in the 50 years since the first Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health. It outlines the continuing burden of disease and death caused by smoking, and identifies additional diseases and conditions causally related to secondhand smoke exposure.
2012—Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults
This report adds to our knowledge about the prevalence, causes, effects, and implications of tobacco use by young people. It details the factors that lead youth and young adults to initiate tobacco use, and the devastating health and economic impact of that decision on our nation as well as on individuals, their families, and their communities. This report also identifies proven, effective strategies that have the potential to dramatically reduce tobacco use.
2010—How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease: The Biology and Behavioral Basis for Smoking-Attributable Disease
This report is a comprehensive, scientific discussion of how tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke exposure, damages the human body. The report focuses on cigarettes and cigarette smoke to show how cigarettes cause addiction and death. It includes effective interventions for tobacco control and prevention.

Surgical Site Infections (SSI)
EXPLORE TOPICS

Surgical Site Infection Basics
KEY POINTS
A surgical site infection (SSI) is an infection in the part of the body where a surgery took place.
SSIs can generally be treated with antibiotics but may require additional medical care.
There are ways to reduce your risk of contracting an SSI.
Overview
A surgical site infection (SSI) is a type of healthcare-associated infection (HAI). It is an infection that occurs in the part of the body where a surgery took place.
Types
SSIs can occur in:
Skin
Tissue
Organs
Implanted material, like a hip replacement
Signs and symptoms
Redness and pain around the area where you had surgery.
Cloudy fluid draining from your surgical wound.
Fever.
Other signs and symptoms may also occur.
Reducing risk
Before surgery:
Tell your healthcare provider about other medical problems you may have. Health problems such as allergies, diabetes and obesity could affect your surgery and your treatment.
Quit smoking. Patients who smoke get more infections. Talk to your healthcare provider about how you can quit before your surgery.
Do not shave near where you will have surgery. Shaving with a razor can irritate your skin and make it easier to develop an infection.
At the time of surgery:
Speak up if someone tries to shave you with a razor in the area where you will have surgery. Ask why you need to be shaved in the area and talk with your surgeon if you have any concerns.
After surgery:
If you do not see your healthcare provider clean their hands, please ask them to do so.
Family and friends should not touch the surgical wound or dressings.
Family and friends should clean their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub before and after visiting you. If you do not see them clean their hands, ask them to clean their hands.
Always clean your hands before and after caring for your wound.
Before you leave the hospital:
Make sure you understand how to care for your wound.
Make sure you know who to contact if you have questions or problems.
Once you are home:
If you have any symptoms of an infection, such as redness and pain at the surgery site, drainage, or fever, call your healthcare provider immediately.
Healthcare providers should always follow Core Infection Control Practices and SSI Prevention Guidelines to reduce the risk of spreading germs to patients.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment generally includes antibiotics, but the type of treatment depends on the germ causing the infection. Sometimes, patients need another surgery to treat SSIs.
What CDC is doing
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to SSIs.
Tracking SSIs through the National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.

Surveillance Case Definitions for Current and Historical Conditions
CDC’s website is being modified to comply with President Trump’s Executive Orders.
A surveillance case definition is a set of uniform criteria used to define a disease for public health surveillance. Surveillance case definitions enable public health officials to classify and count cases consistently across reporting jurisdictions. Surveillance case definitions are not intended to be used by healthcare providers for making a clinical diagnosis or determining how to meet an individual patient’s health needs.
While the list of reportable conditions varies by state, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) has recommended that state health departments report cases of selected diseases to CDC’s National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Every year, case definitions are updated using CSTE’s Position Statements. They provide uniform criteria of national notifiable infectious and non-infectious conditions for reporting purposes.

Surveys and Data Collection Systems
KEY POINTS
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) surveys people and healthcare providers to collect data about health and health care in the United States.
The National Vital Statistics System provides official data from birth and death certificates.
This page provides an overview of NCHS's current health surveys and data collection systems.
Overview
NCHS collects data through population surveys, healthcare provider surveys, and data collection systems.
Population surveys
NCHS currently conducts four population surveys. Population surveys collect data from a group of participants who belong to and represent a larger group of people. The larger group of people is the population being studied. NCHS population surveys collect data from individual people and households in the United States.
Healthcare provider surveys
NCHS collects data from healthcare professionals and administrators working in a range of healthcare settings through the National Health Care Surveys. These surveys provide information about the organizations and providers that deliver health care, the services they provide, and the patients they serve across diverse settings.
Data collection systems
Surveys are not NCHS's only method of gathering health information. NCHS also uses data shared from existing health information sources. The National Vital Statistics System draws data from information reported on birth and death certificates. States and territories collect, complete, and maintain these records, which they share with NCHS to create the nation's vital statistics.
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is the only national health survey that includes health exams and lab tests.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) monitors the health and nutritional status of adults and children across the United States. NHANES is unique among population surveys because it combines interviews, health exams, lab tests, and dietary interviews. Each year, NHANES examines about 5,000 people across the country in Mobile Exam Centers.
NHANES provides important health and nutrition statistics on adults and children living in the United States. In health exams, NHANES experts can directly measure height, weight, vision, dental health, and other health characteristics. Lab tests can detect undiagnosed health conditions, like diabetes, and past contact with substances in air, water, food, or soil that may harm health, called environmental exposures. Findings from NHANES have driven national and state policies to protect and improve the health of children and adults.

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
National Health Interview Survey
The National Health Interview Survey is the nation's largest and oldest household health survey. NHIS began collecting data in 1957.
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) monitors the health of the U.S. population by collecting and analyzing data on a broad range of health topics. NHIS focuses on the health of U.S. children and adults.
Each year, NHIS collects data from about 28,000 adults through personal interviews. Parents also provide health information about children in their households. Collecting data from this many people (the survey's sample) allows NHIS to produce official national estimates. The robust data NHIS collects can be analyzed by many characteristics to help us better understand how health differs among groups within the U.S. population.
NHIS results have provided important data to track health status, health insurance coverage, unmet healthcare needs, and progress toward achieving national health goals.

National Health Interview Survey
National Survey of Family Growth
The National Survey of Family Growth is a critical source of information about the health of women, men, and families.
The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is a survey of people ages 15–49. NSFG gathers information on pregnancy and births, marriage, living arrangements, infertility, use of birth control, family life, and general and reproductive health. NSFG uses online surveys and personal interviews to collect data on these topics. Participants answer more sensitive questions on their own.
NSFG methods produce national statistics. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other government agencies use NSFG data to plan health and social services and health education programs. Researchers use these data to conduct statistical studies of families, fertility, and health.

National Survey of Family Growth
Rapid Surveys System
NCHS Rapid Surveys get the right data in the right hands at the right time.
NCHS Rapid Surveys provide data for evidence-based decision-making and faster public health response. NCHS fields Rapid Surveys several times each year using commercial online survey panels. Each survey includes a broad range of questions based on CDC’s needs at that time, so no two Rapid Surveys are alike.
Rapid Surveys can be used to—
Collect data on niche, emerging, or priority health topics
Close health information gaps
Learn how values and beliefs can affect access, care, and wellness
Assess questionnaire design to ensure data collection is meaningful

NCHS Rapid Surveys System
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey provides high quality, objective, reliable information about care provided in physicians' offices and health centers.
The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) collects data about medical services provided in offices for patients who aren't admitted to a hospital or other facility. NAMCS collects and releases high quality, objective, reliable information about how these ambulatory medical care services are provided and used in the United States. NAMCS collects data from both office-based physicians and health centers.
In addition to data about provider, practice, and health center characteristics, NAMCS collects information about telemedicine use, electronic health records use, and healthcare delivery. NAMCS data support—
Evidence-based decision-making by policy makers
Operational policies across ambulatory care settings
Medical education for current and future providers
Research to understand and improve healthcare delivery
Keep Reading:
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
National Electronic Health Records Survey
National Electronic Health Records Survey data help drive important program and policy decisions related to electronic health records.
The National Electronic Health Records Survey (NEHRS) measures the progress U.S. physicians and their offices have made in adopting electronic health records (EHRs). The survey also monitors progress toward electronic sharing of health data (health information exchange) and the burden associated with EHRs.
NEHRS collects data about EHR use from office-based physicians practicing in the United States. NEHRS data tracks participation in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Promoting Interoperability Programs. In addition, researchers can use NEHRS data to produce state and national estimates of EHR adoption, capabilities, and burden.

National Electronic Health Records Survey
National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Survey has released data from its final data collection. NCHS will publish further analyses of these data.
The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) collected data about medical services for patients who were treated in hospital emergency and outpatient departments without being admitted to the hospital.
NCHS conducted NHAMCS annually through 2022. The survey collected and released high quality, objective, reliable information about how hospital-based ambulatory medical care services were provided and used in the United States. To collect NHAMCS data, information was manually taken from medical records. Now, the widespread use of electronic health records allows this information to be shared electronically, including with public health authorities like NCHS, more easily.

National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
National Hospital Care Survey
National Hospital Care Survey data can identify and track trends in hospital care use, like drug-related visits to emergency departments.
The National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS) collects data on patient care in hospital emergency departments and inpatient discharges. NHCS data describe patterns of health care delivery and use in the United States. NHCS answers questions about use of healthcare and healthcare resources, and the differences in healthcare services that some people and groups experience.
NHCS collects data on patient care and resource use in hospital-based settings. Participating hospitals electronically submit inpatient discharge and emergency department visit data. Hospitals also provide summary information about patient visits for the calendar year through an additional, supplemental interview. Healthcare and public health professionals, researchers, and policymakers use NHCS data to track trends affecting hospital and healthcare organizations, and the patients they serve.

National Hospital Care Survey
National Post-acute and Long-term Care Study
National Post-acute and Long-term Study data help policymakers, healthcare planners, researchers, and providers better understand, plan for, and serve the care needs of older and disabled adults.
The National Post-acute and Long-term Care Study (NPALS) collects and analyzes data from U.S. providers serving people who need continuing care after urgent medical treatment (post-acute care) or who cannot care for themselves for a long period (long-term care). NPALS provides information on seven major sectors of paid, regulated, post-acute and long-term care services, providers, and services users. NPALS uses existing Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data for five sectors, and collects data directly from adult day services centers and residential care communities.
NPALS data are used to describe and understand how long-term care services are delivered and the changes that occur in the delivery of those services over time. Policymakers use these data to make evidence-based policy decisions. Directors of post-acute and long-term care facilities use this information for comparison with their peers. Researchers use NPALS statistics to examine the effectiveness of various care models.

National Post-acute and Long-term Care Study
National Vital Statistics System
Data from birth and death certificates tell a broad story about the health of our country and our communities.
The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) provides the nation's official vital statistics. NVSS draws these statistics from information reported on birth and death certificates. NVSS is the oldest, most successful example of intergovernmental data sharing in public health. Through NVSS, 50 states, New York City, District of Columbia, and 5 U.S. territories send NCHS information on the nearly 7 million vital events—births, deaths, and fetal deaths—that happen each year.
NCHS collects, analyzes, and shares these data to create the nation's official vital statistics. NVSS provides the most complete and continuous data available to public health officials at the national, state, and local levels, and in the private sector. NVSS vital statistics are a critical part of the national health information system, providing data to monitor progress toward achieving important health goals.

Swimmer's Itch (Cercarial Dermatitis)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
PARASITES 
SEPTEMBER 10, 2024
About Swimmer's Itch
KEY POINTS
Swimmer's itch is an infection caused by a parasite.
It can cause an allergic reaction and rash on your skin.
Swimmer's itch is not contagious and does not spread from person to person.
Overview
Swimmer’s itch, also called cercarial dermatitis, appears as a skin rash caused by an allergic reaction to certain microscopic parasites that infect some birds and mammals. These parasites are released from infected snails into fresh and salt water (such as lakes, ponds, and oceans). While the parasite’s preferred host is the specific bird or mammal, if the parasite comes into contact with a swimmer, it burrows into the skin causing an allergic reaction and rash. Swimmer’s itch is found throughout the world and is more frequent during summer months.
Symptoms
Symptoms can include
tingling, burning, or itching of the skin
small reddish pimples
small blisters
Within minutes to days after swimming in contaminated water, you may experience tingling, burning, or itching of the skin. Small reddish pimples appear within twelve hours. Pimples may develop into small blisters. Scratching the areas may result in secondary bacterial infections. Itching may last up to a week or more but will gradually go away.
Because swimmer’s itch is caused by an allergic reaction to infection, the more often you swim or wade in contaminated water, the more likely you are to develop more serious symptoms. The greater the number of exposures to contaminated water, the more intense and immediate symptoms of swimmer’s itch will be.
Be aware that swimmer's itch is not the only rash that may occur after swimming in fresh or salt water.
Exposure risks
Anyone who swims or wades in infested water may be at risk. Larvae are more likely to be present in shallow water by the shoreline. Children are most often affected because they tend to swim, wade, and play in the shallow water more than adults. Also, they are less likely to towel dry themselves when leaving the water.
Water safety after outbreaks
Many factors must be present for swimmer’s itch to become a problem in water. Since these factors change (sometimes within a swim season), swimmer’s itch will not always be a problem. However, there is no way to know how long water may be unsafe. Larvae generally survive for 24 hours once they are released from the snail. However, an infected snail will continue to produce cercariae throughout the remainder of its life. For future snails to become infected, migratory birds or mammals in the area must also be infected so the lifecycle can continue.
Swimming pools
As long as your swimming pool is well maintained and chlorinated, there is no risk of swimmer’s itch. The appropriate snails must be present in order for swimmer’s itch to occur.
Resource
Prevent Swimming-related Illnesses
How it spreads
The adult parasite lives in the blood of infected animals such as ducks, geese, gulls, swans, and certain mammals such as muskrats and raccoons. The parasites produce eggs that are passed in the feces of infected birds or mammals.
If the eggs land in or are washed into the water, the eggs hatch, releasing small, free-swimming microscopic larvae. These larvae swim in the water in search of a certain species of aquatic snail.
If the larvae find one of these snails, they infect the snail, multiply and undergo further development. Infected snails release a different type of microscopic larvae (or cercariae, hence the name cercarial dermatitis) into the water. This larval form then swims about searching for a suitable host (bird, muskrat) to continue the lifecycle. Although humans are not suitable hosts, the microscopic larvae burrow into the swimmer’s skin, and may cause an allergic reaction and rash. Because these larvae cannot develop inside a human, they soon die.
Reducing risk
To reduce the likelihood of developing swimmer’s itch
Do not swim in areas where swimmer's itch is a known problem or where signs have been posted warning of unsafe water.
Do not swim near or wade in marshy areas where snails are commonly found.
Towel dry or shower immediately after leaving the water.
Do not attract birds (e.g., by feeding them) to areas where people are swimming.
Encourage health officials to post signs on shorelines where swimmer's itch is a current problem.
Resource
How to Safely visit Oceans, Lakes, and Rivers
Treatment
Most cases of swimmer’s itch do not require medical attention. If you have a rash, you may try the following for relief:
Use corticosteroid cream
Apply cool compresses to the affected areas
Bathe in Epsom salts or baking soda
Soak in colloidal oatmeal baths
Apply baking soda paste to the rash (made by stirring water into baking soda until it reaches a paste-like consistency)
Use an anti-itch lotion
Though difficult, try not to scratch. Scratching may cause the rash to become infected. If itching is severe, your health care provider may suggest prescription-strength lotions or creams to lessen your symptoms.

About Swine/Variant Flu
WHAT TO KNOW
Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs.
Influenza viruses that commonly circulate in swine are called “swine influenza viruses” or “swine flu viruses.”
Like human influenza viruses, there are different subtypes and strains of swine influenza viruses.
The main swine influenza viruses circulating in U.S. pigs in recent years have been, swine triple reassortant (tr) H1N1 influenza virus, trH3N2 virus, and trH1N2 virus.

Public Health
Overview
Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called ""variant viruses."" They also can be denoted by adding the letter ""v"" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States.
Case Counts
CDC data on the most current case counts for variant flu virus infections in humans reported in the United States.

About Syphilis
KEY POINTS
Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can be cured.
People who are sexually active can get syphilis.
This fact sheet answers general questions about syphilis.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
What is syphilis?
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can cause serious health problems without treatment. Infection develops in stages (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). Each stage can have different signs and symptoms.
Babies can also get syphilis. Congenital syphilis is the disease that happens when women pass syphilis to their babies during pregnancy.
Signs and symptoms
How do I know if I have syphilis?
Each stage of syphilis has different signs and symptoms.
There are four stages of syphilis (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). Each stage has different signs and symptoms.
Primary stage
During the first (primary) stage of syphilis, you may notice a single sore or multiple sores. The sore is the location where syphilis entered your body. These sores usually occur in, on, or around the
Penis
Vagina
Anus
Rectum
Lips or in the mouth
Sores are usually (but not always) firm, round, and painless. Because the sore is painless, you may not notice it. The sore usually lasts 3 to 6 weeks and heals regardless of whether you receive treatment. Even after the sore goes away, you must still receive treatment. This will stop your infection from moving to the secondary stage.
Secondary stage
During the secondary stage, you may have skin rashes and/or sores in your mouth, vagina, or anus. This stage usually starts with a rash on one or more areas of your body. The rash can show up when your primary sore is healing or several weeks after the sore has healed. The rash can be on the palms of your hands and/or the bottoms of your feet and look
Rough
Red
Reddish-brown
The rash usually won't itch, and it is sometimes so faint that you won't notice it. Other symptoms may include
Fever
Swollen lymph glands
Sore throat
Patchy hair loss
Headaches
Weight loss
Muscle aches
fatigue (feeling very tired)
The symptoms from this stage will go away whether you receive treatment. Without the right treatment, your infection will move to the latent and possibly tertiary stages of syphilis.
Latent stage
The latent stage of syphilis is a period when there are no visible signs or symptoms. Without treatment, you can continue to have syphilis in your body for years.
Tertiary stage
Most people with untreated syphilis do not develop tertiary syphilis. However, when it does happen, it can affect many different organ systems. These include the heart and blood vessels, and the brain and nervous system. Tertiary syphilis is very serious and would occur 10–30 years after your infection began. In tertiary syphilis, the disease damages your internal organs and can result in death. A healthcare provider can usually diagnose tertiary syphilis with the help of multiple tests.
Neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis
Without treatment, syphilis can spread to the brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis), the eye (ocular syphilis), or the ear (otosyphilis). This can happen during any of the stages described above.
Signs and symptoms of neurosyphilis can include
Severe headache
Muscle weakness and/or trouble with muscle movements
Changes to your mental state (trouble focusing, confusion, personality change) and/or dementia (problems with memory, thinking, and/or decision making).
Signs and symptoms of ocular syphilis can include
Eye pain and/or redness
Changes in your vision or even blindness
Signs and symptoms of otosyphilis may include
Hearing loss
Ringing, buzzing, roaring, or hissing in the ears (""tinnitus"")
Dizziness or vertigo (feeling like you or your surroundings are moving or spinning)
Risk factors
Am I at risk for syphilis?
Sexually active people can get syphilis through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with a partner who has syphilis.
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for syphilis or other STIs.
Syphilis may be more common in some racial/ethnic and sexual minority groups. For instance, gay and bisexual men are disproportionately impacted by syphilis. In addition, people from racial and ethnic minority groups are experiencing the brunt of the congenital syphilis epidemic. These disparities are due to social, cultural, and economic conditions that make it difficult for sexually active people to stay healthy.
What is the link between syphilis and HIV?
Having a sore or break in the skin from an STI such as syphilis may allow HIV to more easily enter your body. You may also be more likely to get HIV because the same behaviors and circumstances that put you at risk for getting other STIs can also put you at greater risk for getting HIV.
How it spreads
How is syphilis spread?
You can get syphilis by direct contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
Women can also pass syphilis to their baby during pregnancy.
You cannot get syphilis through casual contact with objects, such as
Toilet seats
Doorknobs
Swimming pools
Hot tubs
Bathtubs
Sharing clothing, or eating utensils
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of getting syphilis?
The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting syphilis:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have syphilis.
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex.
Condoms prevent the spread of syphilis by preventing contact with a sore. Sometimes sores occur in areas not covered by a condom. Contact with these sores can still transmit syphilis.
I’m pregnant. If I have syphilis, how can I protect my baby from getting it?
If you are pregnant and have syphilis, you can give the infection to your baby. Having syphilis can lead to a low-birth-weight-baby. It can make it more likely you will deliver your baby too early or stillborn (a baby born dead). To protect your baby, you should receive syphilis testing at least once during your pregnancy. Receive treatment right away if you test positive.
At birth, a baby with a syphilis infection may not have signs or symptoms of disease. However, if the baby does not receive treatment right away, the baby may develop serious problems within a few weeks. These babies can have health problems, such as cataracts, deafness, or seizures, and can die.
Testing and diagnosis
Should I get tested for syphilis?
You should get tested regularly for syphilis if you are sexually active and
Are a gay or bisexual man
Have HIV
Are taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention
Have partner(s) who have tested positive for syphilis
Have certain risk factors for syphilis, like living in a community with high rates of syphilis
All pregnant women should receive syphilis testing at their first prenatal visit. Some pregnant women need to receive syphilis testing again during the third trimester at 28 weeks and at delivery.
How will my healthcare provider know if I have syphilis?
Most of the time, healthcare providers will use a blood test to test for syphilis. Some will diagnose syphilis by testing fluid from a syphilis sore.
Treatment and recovery
Is there a cure for syphilis?
Yes, syphilis is curable with the right antibiotics from your healthcare provider. However, treatment might not undo any damage the infection can cause.
Can I get syphilis again, after receiving treatment?
Having syphilis once does not protect you from getting it again. Even after successful treatment, you can get syphilis again. Only laboratory tests can confirm whether you have syphilis. Follow-up testing by your healthcare provider is necessary to make sure your treatment was successful.
It may not be obvious that a sex partner has syphilis. Syphilis sores in the vagina, anus, mouth, or under the foreskin of the penis, can be hard to see. You may get syphilis again, if your sex partner(s) does not receive testing and treatment.

Syringe Services Programs (SSPs)
EXPLORE TOPICS

FEBRUARY 8, 2024
Syringe Services Programs
KEY POINTS
Syringe services programs are community prevention programs that provide a range of services that prevent spread of disease and protect communities.
They are proven to save lives, help those with substance use disorders get needed support, prevent overdose deaths, and reduce the impact of drug use on the community.
What it is
A syringe services program (or SSP) in action.
Syringe services programs (SSPs) are community-based prevention programs that provide a range of services. These services include:
Links to substance use disorder treatment
Access to and disposal of sterile syringes and injection equipment
Vaccination
Testing
Links to care and treatment for infectious diseases
SSPs protect the public and first responders by providing safe disposal of used needles and syringes. SSPs also prevent outbreaks of other diseases by providing:
Testing
Counseling
Sterile injection supplies
Nearly thirty years of research show that comprehensive SSPs are:
Safe and effective
Cost-saving
Not increasing illegal drug use or crime
Reducing spread of viral hepatitis, HIV, and other infections
Why it matters
A man receives aid from syringe services program workers.
The majority of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are due to injection drug use. Reports of HCV cases rose 3.5-fold from 2010 to 2016.1 Additionally, more than 2,500 new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections each year are due to people who inject drugs.2
The best way to prevent the spread of these diseases for people who inject drugs is to stop injecting them. If that is not possible, use sterile injection equipment for each injection to reduce the risk of infection and prevent outbreaks.
SSPs are associated with an estimated 50% reduction in HIV and HCV infections. Transmission is reduced by over two-thirds34 when combined with medications that treat opioid dependence (also known as medication-assisted treatment).
SSPs act as a bridge to other health services, including HCV and HIV testing and treatment and medication-assisted treatment.5
Outcomes
Most SSPs offer referrals to medication-assisted treatment.6 New SSP users are five times more likely to enter drug treatment. They are also three times more likely to stop using drugs than those who don't use the program.
SSPs prevent overdose deaths by teaching people who inject drugs:
How to recognize and prevent overdose
How to recognize, respond to, and reverse overdose
How to use naloxone, a medication that reverses overdose
Many SSPs provide ""overdose prevention kits"" that contain naloxone to people who inject drugs.789101112
Strategies
SSPs partner with local law enforcement and provide them with naloxone. This helps local police departments respond to and prevent death when someone has overdosed.13
SSPs also protect first responders and the public by providing safe needle disposal. This reduces the amount of discarded needles in the community.141516171819
A 2015 study by the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System found how SSPs' clean needle programs help communities. The more syringes distributed per the number of people who inject drugs, the more likely used syringes would be disposed of safely.20
However, studies in Baltimore 21and New York City22 found that crime rates did not change if an area had SSPs or not.
