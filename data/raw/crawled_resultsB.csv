About B Virus
KEY POINTS
B virus infection is extremely rare but can be serious and even deadly.
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people.
If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, begin first aid immediately and see a healthcare provider.
What it is
B virus infection is extremely rare. However, it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately.
People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms typically start within one month of being exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days.
The first indications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, you may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey.
As the disease progresses, the virus spreads to and causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain and spinal cord. Problems with breathing and death can occur one day to three weeks after symptoms appear.

B Virus Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
Most people will not come in contact with monkeys, so their risk of getting infected with B virus is very low.
However, laboratory workers, veterinarians, and people more likely exposed to macaque monkeys have a higher risk of getting B virus infection.
Keep Reading:
Risk Factors for B Virus
How it spreads
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. You can get infected with B virus if you:
Are bitten or scratched by an infected monkey.
Get an infected monkey's tissue or fluid on your broken skin or in your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Have a needle stick by a contaminated syringe.
Scratch or cut yourself on a contaminated cage or other sharp-edged surface.
Are exposed to the brain (especially), spinal cord, or skull of an infected monkey.

B Virus: Causes and How It Spreads
Prevention
There are no vaccines that can protect you against B virus infection.
If you are in a place with macaque monkeys, stay away from them so that you don't get bitten or scratched. You should not touch or feed monkeys.
People at increased risk should follow appropriate laboratory and animal facility protocols to reduce the spread of B virus.
Treatment and recovery
Get first aid immediately
If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, get first aid and seek immediate medical attention. Follow the steps below.
Thoroughly wash the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey and gently scrub with soap, detergent, or iodine for 15 minutes.
Run water over the wound or area for 15 to 20 minutes more.
Tell the healthcare provider that you have been exposed to a macaque monkey that may be infected with B virus.
If you got exposed to a macaque, wash right away and tell your doctor.
Medications
If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus exposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and treatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease.
How animals are affected
Macaque monkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they reach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do not have symptoms, or have just mild disease.

About Burkholderia cepacia complex
KEY POINTS
Burkholderia cepacia complex, also called B. cepacia or Bcc, is a group of bacteria that can cause infections in healthcare settings.
Good infection control practices, including around the use of water, can help reduce infection risk.
B. cepacia germs can be resistant to antibiotics, making them difficult to treat.
What it is
Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of bacteria commonly found in soil and water.
Symptoms
Symptoms vary, ranging from no symptoms to serious respiratory infections, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung disease. Other symptoms may include:
Fever
Fatigue
At-risk populations
In the United States, people in healthcare settings and those with weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis, are at highest risk of infection with B. cepacia complex.
B. cepacia complex poses little medical risk to healthy people.
How it spreads
Exposure from water, soil or aqueous (watery) environments.
Contact with contaminated surfaces.
Contact with contaminated equipment.
Person-to-person transmission, more commonly in patients with cystic fibrosis.
Reducing risk
Patients and caregivers should:
Keep their hands clean, particularly before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device.
Ask others to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
Avoid exposing wounds and indwelling medical devices (devices put in or connected to the patient's body) to nonsterile water.
Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting.
Healthcare providers should always follow recommended infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Treatment
Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis but generally include antibiotics. Unfortunately, many B. cepacia complex germs are resistant to antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.
Previous outbreaks

About Babesiosis
KEY POINTS
Babesiosis is a disease caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells.
It spreads through tick bites, primarily by blacklegged (deer) ticks.
Some people show no symptoms, others have flu-like symptoms.
Babesiosis is preventable and treatable.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Babesiosis is a disease caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Although there are many different species (types) of Babesia parasite found in animals, only a few infect people. The most common species to infect people in the United States is Babesia microti.
Signs and symptoms
Many people with Babesiosis do not feel sick and have no symptoms. However, some people might get flu-like symptoms, such as:
Fever
Chills
Sweats
Headache
Body aches
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Fatigue
Since the parasites attack red blood cells, babesiosis can lead to hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia occurs when your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. Babesiosis can become a serious, even life-threatening illness for certain people, especially those who:
Do not have a spleen
Have a weak immune system for other reasons such as cancer, lymphoma, or HIV
Have serious health issues such as liver or kidney disease
Are older (> 50 years old)
Symptoms, if they appear, may start around a week after infection, but usually develop over a few weeks or months, or longer.
How it spreads
In the U.S. most Babesia infections are from blacklegged or deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) bites. Ticks are typically found in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas. Currently, most babesiosis cases occur in the Northeast and upper Midwest.
Other less common ways of getting infected with Babesia include:
Getting a blood transfusion that has the parasite in it.
If a mother has babesiosis, she might pass it to her baby during pregnancy or when the baby is born.
Babesia parasites do not spread from person-to-person like the flu or the common cold.
Prevention
To reduce your risk of babesiosis, avoid outdoor areas infested with ticks. If you are in these areas, use tick repellents, wear socks, long-sleeved shirts, and pants, and check yourself and pets for ticks before going inside.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Babesiosis
Diagnosis
A healthcare provider can diagnose babesiosis by examining a small sample of your blood under a microscope. This lab test can confirm the presence of the Babesia parasites in your red blood cells.
Another way your healthcare provider can diagnose babesiosis is by sending your blood samples to a special lab, such as the CDC or a health department, for testing.
Treatment
If you have babesiosis, there is effective treatment. You usually do not need treatment if you have no symptoms or signs of babesiosis. Talk with your healthcare provider for more information.

About Anthrax
KEY POINTS
Anthrax can cause severe illness in both people and animals.
The bacteria that causes anthrax occurs naturally in soil worldwide.
People usually get anthrax from infected animals or contaminated animal products.
Call a healthcare provider immediately if you think you have been exposed to anthrax.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Anthrax is a serious disease usually caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. It's found naturally in soil around the world and commonly affects livestock and wild animals. People usually get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. People can breathe in anthrax spores, eat food or drink water contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the skin.
Livestock and wild animals can become infected when they breathe in, eat, or drink spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. These animals can include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer.
Anthrax is rare in the United States. However, occasional outbreaks do happen in wild and domestic grazing animals such as cattle or deer. In the United States, veterinarians recommend yearly vaccination of livestock in areas where animals have had anthrax in the past.
Most people will never be exposed to anthrax. However, there are jobs, hobbies, and activities that can put some people at higher risk of exposure.
Anthrax risk and prevention
Learn more about who's at risk of exposure and how to prevent anthrax.
Prevention
Types
The type of illness a person develops depends on how anthrax enters the body: through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal system. All types of anthrax can cause death if they're not treated with antibiotics.
There are four types of anthrax:
Cutaneous anthrax happens when anthrax spores get into a cut or scape on the skin when a person handles infected animals or contaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair. It mostly shows up on the head, neck, forearms, and hands. It's the most common form of anthrax infection, and it's also considered to be the least dangerous.
Recently, injection anthrax was identified in heroin-injecting drug users in northern Europe, but it hasn't been reported in the United States. Injection anthrax is similar to cutaneous anthrax and causes infection deep under the skin or in the muscle where the drug was injected.

Inhalation anthrax happens when a person breathes in anthrax spores. It's the deadliest form of the disease. People who work in places such as wool mills, slaughterhouses, and tanneries may breathe in the spores when working with infected animals or contaminated animal products. Inhalation anthrax starts primarily in the lymph nodes in the chest before spreading throughout the rest of the body.

Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs when a person consumes raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal.
New disease caused by anthrax toxin
Welder's anthrax is a newly identified and rare disease that has been found in several people who are welders or metalworkers. This disease causes severe pneumonia and can be fatal. If you are a welder or metalworker and you develop fever and chills with sudden cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood, see a healthcare provider immediately.
Symptoms
The symptoms of anthrax depend on the type of infection. Symptoms show up anywhere from 1 day to more than 2 months after you're exposed to the bacteria that cause anthrax. If you don't get proper treatment, all types of anthrax have the potential to spread through your body and cause severe illness and death.
Cutaneous anthrax
Photo of cutaneous anthrax infection on a person's hand
Symptoms include:
Group of itchy, small blisters or bumps
Large amount of swelling around the sore
Painless sore commonly on the face, neck, arms, or hand that has a black center
Sore appears after the bumps have gone down
For injection anthrax, infected sores (abscesses) deep under the skin or muscle at the injection site
Inhalation anthrax
The chest x-ray of a 46-year-old male four months after the onset of anthrax.
Symptoms include:
Fever and chills
Heavy sweats
Chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath
Confusion or dizziness
Nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains
Headache or body aches
Extreme tiredness
Gastrointestinal anthrax
Symptoms include:
Fever and chills
Swelling of neck or neck glands
Sore throat, hoarseness, and pain when swallowing
Nausea and vomiting, especially bloody vomiting
Diarrhea or bloody diarrhea
Headache
Red face and red eyes
Stomach pain and swelling
Fainting
If you've been exposed to anthrax
See a healthcare provider immediately and explain how you may have been exposed. It's important to get medical care as quickly as possible to have the best chances for a full recovery. Doctors can prescribe antibiotics to prevent you from getting sick, or as treatment if you're already sick.

There is no test to find out if you have been exposed to anthrax. Public health departments will have to do an investigation to see if and how you were exposed.

Prevention
Vaccination
Vaccines are the most effective way to protect against certain types of bacterial meningitis.
There are vaccines for 4 types of bacteria that can cause meningitis. All but the last are widely used in the United States.
Meningococcal vaccines (N. meningitidis)
Pneumococcal vaccines (S. pneumoniae)
Hib vaccines (Haemophilus influenzae serotype b)
Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (M. tuberculosis)

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
DECEMBER 11, 2023
ESPAÑOL
About Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)
KEY POINTS
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common, treatable, vaginal condition.
BV can occur without sexual activity, but factors like douching and multiple partners increase the risk.
It can increase the risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and complications during pregnancy.
What is bacterial vaginosis (BV)?
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition that happens when there is too much of certain bacteria in the vagina, causing an imbalance.
Signs and symptoms
How common is BV?
BV is the most common vaginal condition in women ages 15-44.
Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV.
How it spreads
How does BV spread?
Researchers do not know the cause of BV. However, we do know the condition most often occurs in those who are sexually active. BV is a result of an imbalance of ""good"" and ""harmful"" bacteria in a vagina. Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV.
We also do not know how sex causes BV. There also is no research to show that treating a sex partner affects whether someone gets BV. Having BV can increase your chances of getting other STDs.
Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV.
BV rarely affects those who have never had sex.
You cannot get BV from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools.
Prevention
How can I avoid getting BV?
Healthcare providers and scientists do not completely understand how BV spreads or know how best to prevent it.
The following basic prevention steps may help lower your risk of getting BV:
Not having sex
Limiting your number of sex partners
Not douching
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex
I’m pregnant. How does BV affect my baby?
Treating BV during pregnancy is very important. If you are pregnant and have BV, your baby is more likely to be born early (premature) or at a low birth weight. Low birth weight means having a baby that weighs less than 5.5 pounds at birth.
Treatment and recovery
How do I know if I have BV?
Many people with BV do not have symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may notice:
A thin white or gray vaginal discharge
Pain, itching, or burning in the vagina
A strong fish-like odor, especially after sex
Burning when peeing
Itching around the outside of the vagina
How will my healthcare provider know if I have BV?
A healthcare provider will examine your vagina for signs of discharge. They also can test a sample of vaginal fluid to determine if BV is present.
Is there a cure for BV?
A healthcare provider can treat BV with antibiotics. If you have symptoms, you should be checked and treated by a healthcare provider. It is important to take all the medicine your provider prescribes, even if your symptoms go away. Treatment also may reduce the risk for getting other STDs. BV can return even after treatment.
Male sex partners of women with BV do not need treatment. However, BV can spread between female sex partners.
What happens if I don't receive treatment?
At times, BV will go away without treatment. However, treatment can help avoid the increased chance of some serious health risks associated with BV, including:
Getting or transmitting HIV
Delivering your baby too early if you have BV while pregnant and
Getting other STDs like chlamydia and gonorrhea. These bacteria can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can make it difficult for you to have children

MAY 15, 2024
About Balantidium coli infection
KEY POINTS
Balantidium coli is an intestinal parasite that causes the infection balantidiasis.
Symptoms can include diarrhea and abdominal pain.
You can get balantidiasis by consuming food or water contaminated with infective feces.
Overview
Balantidium coli is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes the infection called balantidiasis. While this type of infection is uncommon in the United States, humans and other mammals can become infected with Balantidium coli by ingesting infective cysts from food and water that is contaminated by feces. Mostly asymptomatic, Balantidium infection can cause such symptoms as diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Balantidium coli infection in humans is rare in the United States. Balantidium coli is found throughout the world, but it is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and developing countries. Because pigs are an animal reservoir, human infections occur more frequently in areas where pigs are raised, especially if good hygiene is not practiced.
Signs and symptoms
Most people infected with Balantidium coli experience no symptoms. Balantidium coli infects the large intestine in humans and produces infective microscopic cysts that are passed in the feces, potentially leading to re-infection or infection of others. People compromised immune systems are the most likely to experience more severe signs and symptoms. These include persistent diarrhea, dysentery, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting. If left untreated, perforation of the colon can occur.
How it spreads
Balantidium coli is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. Humans can become infected by eating and drinking contaminated food and water that has come into contact with infective animal or human fecal matter. Infection can occur in several ways, including the following examples:
Eating meat, fruits, and vegetables that have been contaminated by an infected person or contaminated by fecal matter from an infected animal,
Drinking and washing food with contaminated water, or
Having poor hygiene habits.
Resource
DPDx - Balantidium coli life cycle
Prevention
Balantidium coli infection can be prevented when traveling by following good hygiene practices. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food. Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection. Wash all fruits and vegetables with clean water when preparing or eating them, even if they have a removable skin.
Testing
Stool samples can be examined by a laboratory. Microscopic examination can detect Balantidium coli in the stool.
Treatment
The three medications often used to treat Balantidium coli are tetracycline, metronidazole, and iodoquinol. See your healthcare provider for treatment.

About Bartonella
KEY POINTS
Bartonella bacteria are spread to humans by fleas, body lice, sand flies, or contact with flea-infested animals.
There is no evidence that ticks spread Bartonella infection to people.
Cat scratch disease is the most common form of bartonellosis in the United States.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Several species of Bartonella bacteria cause disease in people. Infection with any one of these bacteria is referred to broadly as bartonellosis, although some forms of infection also have common names (for example, cat scratch disease).
For more information:
Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease)
Bartonella quintana infection
Bartonella bacilliformis infection
B. henselae is transmitted by the scratch of domestic or feral cats. Cats can have fleas that carry the bacteria.
B. quintana is transmitted by the human body louse.
B. bacilliformis is transmitted by bites from infected sand flies.
There is no evidence that Bartonella species can be transmitted to people by ticks. Transmission studies with ticks have only used mice and artificial feeding systems which do not demonstrate that a tick can spread bacteria to people or that the bacteria can survive in a tick for any length of time.

About Bat Flu
KEY POINTS
Bat flu refers to influenza A viruses found in bats.
In their current form, bat influenza viruses do not appear to pose a threat to human health.
The bat species currently known to carry bat influenza viruses are not native to the continental United States, but they are common in Central and South America.
Causes and public health implications
Experts from CDC and Universidad del Valle (University of the Valley) discovered influenza A in bats during a 2009-2010 study in Guatemala. They first found influenza A in bats in little yellow-shouldered bats.1
Yellow-shouldered bat found in Guatemala. Photo credit: CDC/OID/NCEZID – Amy T. Gilbert.
Bat influenza viruses have since been detected in some other species of bats in Central and South America.2
The discovery of bat influenza viruses is important for public health because bats represent a new animal species that may act as a source of influenza viruses. Influenza viruses are already known to spread and cause disease in other animals.
Laboratory research conducted at CDC and elsewhere suggests that bat influenza viruses would need to change significantly to be able to infect and spread easily among humans.
Risk of bat flu spreading to humans
CDC laboratory research suggests bat influenza viruses would need to undergo significant changes to become capable of infecting and spreading easily among people. Therefore, these viruses do not appear to pose a risk to human health in their current form. However, CDC scientists cannot rule out the possibility that these viruses could eventually become capable of infecting humans. The internal genes of bat influenza viruses are compatible with human influenza viruses. That means it is possible that these viruses could exchange genetic information with human influenza viruses through a process called ""reassortment.""
Reassortment occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a single host cell, which allows the viruses to swap genetic information.
Reassortment facts
Reassortment can sometimes lead to the emergence of new flu viruses capable of infecting humans.
The conditions needed for reassortment between human influenza viruses and bat influenza viruses remain unknown. A different animal (such as pigs, horses, dogs, or seals) would need to serve as a ""bridge."" That means that another animal would need to be capable of being infected with both bat influenza virus and human influenza viruses for reassortment to occur.
Since the discovery of bat flu, there has been at least one study to assess the possibility of reassortment events occurring between bat influenza and other influenza viruses.3
So far, the results of these studies continue to indicate that bat influenza viruses are very unlikely to reassort with other influenza viruses. Preliminary laboratory research at CDC suggests that human cells do not support growth of bat influenza viruses.1
Difference between bat influenza viruses and other influenza viruses
The bat influenza viruses discovered in Central and South America are very different from other influenza viruses in humans and animals. All influenza A viruses have hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins. Until the discovery of bat influenza viruses, there were only 16 different classes (or “subtypes”) of HA proteins known to exist in nature.
The new bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America are distinct from pre-existing subtypes. CDC scientists have classified them as new subtypes, denoted as “H17” and “H18.”12
The other surface protein-coding gene of bat influenza viruses, neuraminidase (NA), is different from that of known influenza viruses, as well. CDC scientists have proposed new designations for the NA subtypes found in bats: “N10” and “N11.”
Learn more about influenza viruses
For more information on influenza virus biology and pictures of flu viruses, see Influenza (Flu) Viruses and images of Influenza Viruses.
Impact on influenza virus evolution
The discovery of bat flu has shed light on the evolution of influenza A, B, and C viruses. It is possible that many of the internal genes of bat influenza viruses are descendants of influenza virus families that once circulated more widely in previous centuries and that are now extinct, or yet to be discovered.
Using a process called phylogenic analysis, comparisons between different bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America have shown that there is considerable genetic diversity between them. Some researchers concluded that in Central and South American bat populations, the bat influenza viruses may have as much genetic diversity as those found in the influenza viruses of all other mammal and bird species combined.
These conclusions suggest that bat influenza viruses have been evolving in bats over a very long time, potentially centuries.2
How bat flu was discovered
The discovery of the bat influenza viruses was made possible by field work conducted by the following:
CDC's Global Disease Detection (GDD) Regional Center in Guatemala, in collaboration with CDC's Pathogen Discovery Program.
CDC's Rabies program.
Universidad del Valle in Guatemala.
A total of 316 healthy bats from 21 different species were captured from eight locations in southern Guatemala during 2009 and 2010. Rectal swabs and tissues were collected from each of the bats.
Videos showing how specimens are collected from bats in Guatemala are available: ""Global Disease Detectives""
and ""CDC Global Disease Detectives: Clues From a Bat Cave.""
Swabs that were negative for rabies were analyzed by the Pathogen Discovery Program in CDC's Division of Viral Diseases to detect other pathogenic viruses. Initial viral screening determined that 3 of the 316 bats tested positive for influenza. All were from a single species known as little yellow-shouldered bats.
The Pathogen Discovery Program was able to identify and sequence the complete genome of the new viruses using high-throughput sequencing instruments in the laboratory.

PARASITES 
NOVEMBER 5, 2024
About Raccoon Roundworm
KEY POINTS
Raccoon roundworm is an intestinal parasitic infection caused by Baylisascaris worms.
You can get raccoon roundworm when you consume infectious eggs, usually accidentally.
Infections in people are rare, but the parasite can infect other animals, like dogs.
Overview
Baylisascaris infection is caused by a roundworm found in raccoons. This roundworm can infect people as well as a variety of other animals, including dogs. Human infections are rare but can be severe if the parasites invade the eye (ocular larva migrans), organs (visceral larva migrans) or the brain (neural larva migrans).
Species
Different species of Baylisascaris are associated with different animal hosts. For example, Baylisascaris procyonis is found in raccoons, and Baylisascaris columnaris is found in skunks. Cases of Baylisascaris infection in people are not frequently reported but can be severe. Baylisascaris procyonis is thought to pose the greatest risk to people because of the often-close association of raccoons to human dwellings.
Symptoms
The incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms) is usually 1 – 4 weeks. If present, signs and symptoms can include
Nausea
Tiredness
Liver enlargement
Loss of coordination
Lack of attention to people and surroundings
Loss of muscle control
Blindness
Coma
Causes and spread
People become infected by consuming infectious eggs. Most infections are in children and others who are more likely to put dirt or animal waste in their mouth by mistake.
Prevention
Eggs passed in raccoon feces are not immediately infectious. In the environment, eggs take 2 – 4 weeks to become infectious. If raccoons have set up a den or a latrine (places where raccoons defecate) in your yard, raccoon feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed carefully and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill. Care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes. Treat decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane flame-gun (exercise proper precautions). Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces before the eggs become infectious will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection.
Do not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets.
Washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases.
Diagnosis
You should discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask you questions (for example, about your interactions with raccoons or other wild animals). Baylisascaris infection is difficult to diagnosis in humans. There are no widely available tests, so the diagnosis is often made by ruling out other diseases.
Treatment
A healthcare provider can discuss treatment options with you. No drug has been found to be completely effective against raccoon roundworm in people. Albendazole, a broad spectrum anthelmintic, has been recommended for specific cases.
Early treatment might reduce serious damage caused by the infection. If you suspect you may have ingested raccoon feces, seek immediate medical attention.

About Bed Bugs
WHAT TO KNOW
Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people.
Bites can cause itching, loss of sleep, and, rarely, allergic reactions.
Prevent bed bugs by regularly looking for signs of infestation.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Bed bugs (Cimex species) are small, flat insects. Bed bugs bite people and animals at night while they sleep, feeding on their blood.
Bed bugs are reddish-brown in color, are wingless, and range from 1mm to 7mm in size (roughly the size of Lincoln's head on a penny). They can live several months without a blood meal.
Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people. However, they cause irritation, itching, and loss off sleep. Removal from dwellings can be expensive and inconvenient to remove.
Where you can find bed bugs
You can find bed bugs anywhere, from North and South America, to Africa, Asia, and Europe. Bed bugs are in five-star hotels and resorts. How clean a place is does not determine whether bed bugs are present.
Signs and symptoms
Although bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people, they can cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes intense itching can lead to excessive scratching and possibly a secondary skin infection. An allergic reaction to several bites is possible. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider.
How to tell if you've been bitten
Bed bug bites affect each person differently. Signs of a bed bug bites include
No physical signs
Small bite marks
Serious allergic reactions (rare).
When bed bugs bite, they inject fluids (anesthetic and anticoagulant) that prevents a person from feeling the bite when it happens. Most people do not notice the bite marks until they appear from one to several days after the initial bite.
Bites look similar to mosquito or flea bites—a slightly swollen and red area that may itch and be irritating. The bite marks may be random or appear in a straight line.
Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems that arise from intense scratching of the bites.
Allergic reactions are possible
Allergic symptoms can include enlarged bite marks, painful swellings at the bite site, and, on rare occasions, anaphylaxis. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider.
Exposure risks
Everyone is at risk for getting bed bugs when visiting an infested area. However, you are at higher risk of getting bed bugs if you travel frequently and share living and sleeping space where other people have previously slept.
Causes and spread
Bed bugs are experts at hiding. Their slim flat bodies allow them to fit into very small spaces. They can go long periods of time without a blood meal.
Bed bugs spread by getting into the seams and folds of luggage, overnight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else they can hide. Most people do not realize they are transporting bed bugs and infecting areas as they travel.
Resource
DPDx - Bed Bug life cycle
Reducing risk
Early detection and eradication of bed bugs can make infestations easier to control. For those that travel, it may be helpful to look for signs of infestation, such as exoskeletons or bed bugs in folds of mattresses and sheets, in sleeping areas.
Where to look for bed bugs
Bed bug infestations usually happen around or near areas where people sleep. This includes apartments, shelters, houses, hotels, cruise ships, buses, trains, and dorm rooms.
The bugs hide during the day in places on or around the bed. They can hide in
The seams of mattresses
Box springs
Bed frames and headboards
Dresser tables
Inside cracks or crevices
Behind wallpaper
Bed bugs can travel over 100 feet in a night but tend to live within 8 feet of where people sleep.
Signs of an infestation
One of the easiest ways to identify a bed bug infestation is by bite marks on the face, neck, arms, hands, or any other body parts after sleeping. However, these bite marks may take as long as 14 days to develop in some people. It's important to look for other clues to determine if you have an infestation.
Look for
Exoskeletons (shed after molting),
Bed bugs in the fold of mattresses and sheets,
Rusty–colored blood spots on mattresses or nearby furniture, and
A sweet musty odor.
Treatment
Treating bites
Bed bug bites can cause inflammatory reactions in some people, but usually do not require medical treatment. The best way to treat a bite is to apply antiseptic creams or lotions to help with itching and to avoid scratching the area (to prevent secondary infections). For people with itchy inflammatory reactions, an antihistamine may help control the itching.
Treating infestations
If you think you have a bed bug infestation, contact a professional pest control company experienced with treating bed bugs. They will typically spray insecticides to treat the area.

Benzene
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Benzene is a colorless or light-yellow liquid chemical at room temperature.
Signs and symptoms of benzene poisoning depend on how you were exposed.
Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed.
Background
Benzene is a liquid chemical at room temperature. It either has no color or is light-yellow. It has a sweet smell and is very flammable.
Benzene evaporates into the air very quickly. It is heavier than air and may sink into lower areas. Benzene dissolves only a little in water and will float on top of water.
Where it is found
Benzene is formed in nature and from human activities. Natural sources include volcanoes and forest fires. It is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke.
Benzene is used often in the United States. It is in the top 20 produced chemicals by quantity. Some industries use benzene to make other chemicals that are used to make plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers.
It is also used to make:
Detergents
Drugs
Dyes
Some types of lubricants
Pesticides
Rubbers
How it works
Benzene works by causing cells not to work correctly.
For example, it can cause bone marrow not to produce enough red blood cells. This can lead to anemia. It can also hurt the immune system by changing blood levels of antibodies and causing the loss of white blood cells.
Signs and symptoms
The level of benzene poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and medical conditions they may have.
These signs and symptoms may show up within minutes to several hours. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to benzene.
If breathed in:
Drowsiness and dizziness
Fast or irregular heartbeat
Headaches
Tremors
Confusion
Unconsciousness
Death (at very high levels)
If swallowed:
Vomiting or irritation of the stomach
Dizziness
Sleepiness
Convulsions (uncontrolled muscle shaking)
Fast or irregular heartbeat
Death (at very high levels)
If a person vomits because they ate or drank something with benzene, the vomit could be sucked into the lungs. This can cause breathing problems and coughing.
If benzene touches the eyes, skin, or lungs, it can cause injury and irritation.
Exposure
People working in jobs that make or use benzene may be exposed to the highest levels of it.
Outdoors
Low levels of benzene can be found at:
Tobacco smoke
Gas stations
Car exhaust
Industrial emissions
The air around hazardous waste sites or gas stations can contain higher levels of benzene than in other areas.
Benzene leaks from underground storage tanks or from hazardous waste sites containing benzene can contaminate well water.
Indoors
Indoor air generally contains levels of benzene higher than those in outdoor air. It can come from products such as:
Glues
Paints
Furniture wax
Detergents
What to do if you are exposed
Get fresh air by leaving the area where the benzene is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from benzene.
If benzene was released outside, move away from the area. If benzene was released indoors, get out of the building.
If you're in immediate danger
If you swallowed benzene, do not induce vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away.

If you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any benzene from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.
For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit ""About Getting Clean.""
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a benzene release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Evacuation.""
For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Sheltering in Place.""
Treatment
The most important thing is for people to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.
No cure exists for benzene poisoning. Benzene poisoning is treated with supportive medical care in a hospital.
Long-term health effects
Blood
Long-term exposure, or exposure of a year or more, to benzene can affect the blood. Benzene causes harmful effects on bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia. It can also cause excessive bleeding and affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection.
Bones
Studies in animals show low birth weights, bones being formed late, and bone marrow damage when pregnant animals breathed benzene.
Cancer
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has said that benzene causes cancer in humans. Long-term exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause leukemia, a blood-related cancer.
Fertility
Some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods. Some women also had a decrease in the size of their ovaries. It is not known whether benzene exposure affects the developing fetus in pregnant women or fertility in men.

WHAT TO KNOW
CDC's NSSP provides the syndromic surveillance community with the BioSense Platform. This secure, cloud-based system detects and monitors health threats. Successfully onboarding health care facilities, vendors, and public health sites into the platform is vital. High-quality live data feeds power the system. These data, paired with standardized tools and processes, enable effective investigation and rapid response. Our onboarding work is an investment in a modernized public health data infrastructure.
Key roles in the process
Facilities transmit de-identified patient information to the BioSense Platform in near real-time. Our partners in this process who help ensure high-quality data feeds include:
The facility that will submit data. In addition to the organizations that deliver care, this could also include electronic health record vendors or health information exchanges.
The site, our term for the public health authority that serves as an administrative hub for groupings of facilities that transmit data.
The site administrator, the primary public health authority contact at each site. Site admins will build relationships with facility staff and oversee all aspects of onboarding. Site admins serve as liaisons between facilities and NSSP.
Identifying your site administrator
If you are associated with a facility and you're not sure who your site administrator is, contact your state or local health department. You can also reach out to NSSP by emailing nssp@cdc.gov, or create an NSSP Service Desk ticket

Birth Data
Print
In the United States, State laws require birth certificates to be completed for all births, and Federal law mandates national collection and publication of births and other vital statistics data. The National Vital Statistics System, the Federal compilation of this data, is the result of the cooperation between the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the States to provide access to statistical information from birth certificates.
Standard forms for the collection of the data and model procedures for the uniform registration of the events are developed and recommended for State use through cooperative activities of the States and NCHS. Material is available to assist persons in completing the death certificate. NCHS shares the costs incurred by the States in providing vital statistics data for national use.

Pneumoconioses Disease
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
JANUARY 19, 2024
About Pneumoconioses
KEY POINTS
The pneumoconioses are a group of lung diseases caused by the lung’s reaction when breathing in certain dusts.
The main cause of the pneumoconioses is workplace exposure.
All forms of pneumoconioses can be severe.
Overview
Healthy lung versus black lung.
The primary pneumoconioses are:
Abestosis – caused by inhaling asbestos fibers
Silicosis – caused by inhaling silica dust
Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (commonly referred to as CWP or black lung) caused by inhaling coal mine dust
There is also a form called mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Byssinosis, caused by exposure to cotton dust, is sometimes included with pneumoconioses. Although the pattern of lung abnormality in Byssinosis is different from the types of disease listed above. Also, many consider the term pneumoconosis as referring only to diseases caused by inhaling mineral dusts.
Pneumoconiosis typically takes years to develop. However, rapidly progressive forms of silicosis can occur after short periods of intense exposure. When severe, the diseases often lead to lung impairment, disability, and premature death. Pneumoconioses can be avoided through appropriate dust control.
Other forms of pneumoconiosis can be caused by inhaling dusts containing:
Aluminum
Antimony
Barium
Graphite
Iron
Kaolin
Mica
Talc
Symptoms
Pneumoconiosis symptoms depend on how severe the disease is. They include:
Shortness of breath
Coughing
Increased phlegm
Diagnosis
Identifying and classifying pneumoconioses
Lung x-ray showing pneumoconiosis in coal miner.
The pneumoconioses are typically detected through radiological imaging. Severity of lung impairment can be assessed using pulmonary function tests. The International Labor Office (ILO) provides guidelines
for classifying radiographs of the pneumoconioses.
NIOSH operates the B Reader Program. This program allows physicians to document their proficiency in classifying radiographs (using ILO guidelines) by taking an examination.
Treatment
Pneumoconiosis cannot be cured. Controlling symptoms through proper treatment is vital. Workers should avoid exposure to dust and smoking. Treatment may include oxygen or medications that help to open lung passages. Workers should see a doctor if they have symptoms they suspect are related to their workplace.
Resources
NIOSHTIC-2 is a searchable bibliographic database of occupational safety and health publications, documents, grant reports, and other communication products. Search ""pneumoconiosis"" for publications related to this disease.

Bladder Cancer Basics
KEY POINTS
To lower the risk of bladder cancer, don’t smoke and be especially careful around certain kinds of chemicals.
Blood in the urine is the most common symptom.
Overview
Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the bladder, it is called bladder cancer.
The bladder (sometimes called the urinary bladder) is a balloon-shaped organ in your lower abdomen, near the pelvis. It stores urine from the kidneys until it is passed out of the body.

for licensing.
Symptoms
Blood in the urine. This is the most common symptom.
Having to urinate often.
Pain while urinating.
Back pain.
Pelvic pain.
These symptoms can also come from other conditions. If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor, which is the only way to find out what may be causing them.
Risk factors
Smoking is the most important risk factor for bladder cancer. Other risk factors include:
Having a family history of bladder cancer.
Having certain gene mutations (unusual changes made when your body's cells are dividing).
Being exposed to too much of certain workplace chemicals used in processing paint, dye, metal, and petroleum products.
Taking some kinds of chemotherapy drugs.
Drinking well water contaminated with arsenic.
Taking the Chinese herb Aristolochia fangchi.
Having chronic urinary tract infections (including those caused by Schistosoma haematobium).
Reducing risk
To lower the risk of bladder cancer, don’t smoke (and if you do, quit) and be especially careful around certain kinds of chemicals.
Statistics
The Data Visualizations tool makes it easy for anyone to explore and use the latest official federal government cancer data from United States Cancer Statistics. It includes the latest cancer data covering the US population.

PARASITES 
SEPTEMBER 4, 2024
About Blastocystis
KEY POINTS
Blastocystis is a common, microscopic parasite that lives in a person's intestines.
It can remain in your intestines for weeks, months, or years.
If you are infected with Blastocystis, it is called blastocystosis.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Blastocystis is a microscopic parasite found throughout the world. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. A full understanding of Blastocystis and whether it causes disease in humans is unclear. There are prescription drugs available to treat blastocystosis in people with symptoms.
Signs and symptoms
Many people with blastocystosis have no symptoms. However, some people who have Blastocystis in their stool (poop) have some of the following symptoms:
Watery or loose stools
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Anal itching
Weight loss
Constipation
Excess gas
In some studies, blastocystosis has also been associated with various skin rashes and hives.
How it spreads
It is unclear how Blastocystis spreads. However, the number of people infected appears to increase in areas that use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact). Studies have suggested that risk of infection may increase through:
Consuming contaminated food or water.
Working at or attending a daycare or childcare facility.
Close contact with a wide range of animals.
There is little risk of spreading the infection if you practice good personal hygiene, as outlined in the prevention steps.
Prevention
You can take steps to prevent blastocystosis.
Sanitation and hygiene precautions
Use sanitation facilities (toilets and latrines) that are out of reach from animals and will not let feces seep into the water or around food supplies.
Wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching or working with soil or animals and before handling food.
Teach children the importance of handwashing.
Food precautions
Wash and peel fruits and vegetables before eating them.
Avoid water or food that may be contaminated.
When traveling in countries where the water supply may be unsafe,
Avoid drinking unboiled tap water.
Avoid uncooked foods washed with unboiled tap water.
Bottled or canned carbonated beverages, seltzers, pasteurized fruit drinks, and steaming hot coffee and tea are safe to drink.
Diagnosis
If you think you have blastocystosis, speak with your healthcare provider. They may ask you to provide stool samples for testing. Diagnosis may be difficult, so your provider may ask you to submit several stool samples.
Treatment and recovery
Prescription drugs are available to treat blastocystosis. If you received a diagnosis of blastocystosis, speak with your healthcare provider about treatment options.

Blood Safety Basics
KEY POINTS
Each day, life-saving blood transfusions are needed across the United States.
Most patients do not experience side effects from transfusions. On rare occasions, transfusions can cause adverse reactions in patients receiving blood.
Although the U.S. blood supply is safer than ever, some bacteria, viruses, etc. can infect blood transfusion recipients.
All blood donors and blood donations are screened for infections and diseases.
Overview
The U.S. blood supply is safer than it has ever been. However, blood transfusions can transmit any bloodborne pathogen.
Report a Possible Outbreak
To report a possible transfusion-transmitted infection cluster or outbreak.
Call: 770-488-7100
E-mail: haioutbreak@cdc.gov
Complications
Several types of bacteria, viruses, parasites and prions can infect blood donors and recipients, though these infections are rare. Adverse reactions (e.g., allergic reaction, transfusion-transmitted infection, etc.) to a blood transfusion are also very rare. The most common adverse reactions from blood transfusions are allergic and febrile reactions, which make up over half of all adverse reactions reported.
Reducing Risk
Screening donated blood
Healthcare providers and blood banks ask donors a set of standard questions before donating blood including:
Whether or not they are in good health
Their social behavior and health history
If they are free of any bacterial, viral or parasitic diseases
If they have traveled to areas where transmittable diseases are common
If their answers indicate they are not well or are at risk for having a disease transmissible by blood transfusion, they cannot donate blood.
Testing donated blood
Once donated, laboratory technicians test for blood type, certain infectious diseases and additional proteins (or antibodies) that may cause adverse reactions in a person receiving a blood transfusion.
Keep Reading:
Clinical Testing Guidance for Blood Safety
Quick Facts
There are approximately 7 million blood donors and more than 14 million units of blood transfused annually in the United States.
Every 2 seconds someone in the United States needs blood and or platelets.
The U.S. healthcare system needs approximately 29,000 units of red blood cells every day.
The U.S. healthcare system needs nearly 5,000 units of platelets and 6.500 units of plasma per day.
What CDC is doing
The CDC's Office of Blood, Organ and Other Tissue Safety (BOOTS) conducts surveillance for adverse events following blood transfusions. Providers can use this information to prevent transfusion-related events through evidence-based interventions and recommendations. Hospitals provide this information voluntarily.
Assisting state and local health departments and hospitals in investigating reports of potential infectious disease transmission.
Collecting and monitoring data on blood safety and adverse reactions in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hemovigilance Module since 2010. By collecting data in a national system, CDC analyzes aggregate data to understand how to prevent transfusion-related adverse events.
Conducting surveillance for blood utilization through the National Blood Collection & Utilization Survey.

PARASITES 
JUNE 24, 2024
ESPAÑOL
About Body Lice
KEY POINTS
Body lice are parasitic insects that feed on human blood.
Body lice spread by direct contact with others who have them.
Symptoms include itching, rash, and bites.
The only treatment is to improve hygiene and access to clean clothes.
Overview
Body lice are parasites, or insects, that feed on human blood. Body lice can spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. Adult body lice are small, only 2.3 – 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed).
Improved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment needed for body lice infestations; however, in some cases peduculicides are recommended. Body lice can spread disease (epidemic typhus, Bartonella quintana infection, and epidemic relapsing fever).
Symptoms
Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense itching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the skin.
When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become thickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper thighs).
Who is at risk
Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. They affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread quickly in:
People experiencing homelessness
Refugees
Survivors of war or natural disasters
How it spreads
Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with a person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice tends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean clothes.
Nits (lice eggs) take 6 – 9 days to hatch. Nits are tiny (0.8 – 0.3 mm) and hard to see; they can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a pinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per day. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse will die within 1 – 2 days off the host.
Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice.
Prevention
Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice:
Bathe regularly and change into machine-washed clothes at least once a week.
Machine wash and dry infested clothing and bedding using the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle.
Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store for two weeks.
Do not share clothing, beds, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with body lice.
You can fumigate or dust with chemical insecticides to control and prevent the spread of body lice for certain diseases (e.g., epidemic typhus).
Diagnosis
You can diagnose body lice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes you can see a body louse crawling or feeding on the skin.
Although body lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or eggs.
See a healthcare provider if you are unsure about an infestation.
Treatment and recovery
You can treat a body lice infestation by improving personal hygiene. Bathe and change into clean clothes at least once a week. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels used by the person infested with lice using hot water (at least 130°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle.
Pediculicide, a medicine that can kill lice, is sometimes used for treatment. If prescribed a pediculicide, apply it exactly as directed on the bottle or by your healthcare provider. However, a pediculicide is generally not necessary if hygiene is maintained and items are machine washed appropriately at least once a week.

About Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
KEY POINTS
Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria.
Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria: soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF), and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF).
Overview
Relapsing fever is an illness characterized by one or more episodes of fever, headache, and muscle pain that lasts several days and is separated by roughly a week of feeling well. Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria, which are distantly related to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria:
Soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), also known as tickborne relapsing fever
Hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF)
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)
There are differences in how severe the infection can be and where a person may be exposed.

About Bottled Water Safety
KEY POINTS
The United States has rules in place to protect you from getting sick from commercially bottled water.
Check the label on your bottled water for water quality information.
If you think you got sick from bottled water, contact your health department to report your illness.
Overview
Source
Bottled water can come from a variety of sources, such as public tap water systems or from under the ground (for example, mineral water). No matter its source, bottled water must meet safe drinking water standards.
Safety rules
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulates the safety of bottled water in the United States. FDA bases its bottled water standards on the safe drinking water rules for tap water.
FDA requires bottled water companies to:
Protect bottled water sources from germs and chemicals
Test water before and after it is bottled
Follow additional safety rules during processing, bottling, holding, and transport
Health risks
Bottled water contaminated with harmful germs or chemicals can make you sick. Symptoms depend on the type of germ or chemical in the unsafe water and can be mild to serious.
Anyone can get sick from unsafe water, but some people are at higher risk.
Keep Reading:
Health Effects and Who is at Risk
Outbreaks
Outbreaks of illness linked to bottled water are rarely reported, but they do happen.
Find data about past outbreaks linked to bottled water on CDC's BEAM dashboard:
Select ""NORS View"" at the bottom of the dashboard
Then ""Waterborne"" in the top left panel
Then ""Commercially bottled"" under ""Water Type"" on the left
Contamination
Although bottled water companies must follow FDA's safe water rules
, sometimes bottled water gets contaminated with germs or chemicals.
Bottled water can get contaminated by germs or chemicals:
At the water's source
If the company does not properly treat the water to remove germs and chemicals
During the manufacturing process
During shipping or storage
After people buy it
Report illnesses
If you think you got sick from bottled water, contact your health department. Reporting your illness can help them find out what caused you to get sick and prevent more illnesses.
Tips
Read the label
While there is currently no standard label for bottled water, labels often provide some water quality information.
Look on the bottle's label for:
Where the water came from (source)
How it was treated to make it safe for drinking (for example, reverse osmosis, distillation, or another treatment method)
A phone number or web address where you can learn more about the water's quality
Check CDC's About Home Water Treatment Systems page to see what types of germs and chemicals different water treatment methods remove.

About Botulism
KEY POINTS
Botulism is a rare but serious illness.
It is caused by a toxin that attacks the body’s nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death.
The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and related bacteria.
There are five main kinds of botulism. All are medical emergencies.
Overview
Botulism (""BOT-choo-liz-um"") is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death.
The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and sometimes Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii bacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants.
The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it's rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions.
The spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they're eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known.
The conditions in which the spores can grow and make toxin are:
Low-oxygen or no oxygen (anaerobic) environment
Low acid
Low sugar
Low salt
A certain temperature range
A certain amount of water
For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly.
Most common types
There are 5 main kinds of botulism.
Foodborne botulism
Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin.
Wound botulism
Wound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a toxin. People who inject illicit drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People who have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound botulism.
Infant botulism
For reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get into their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin.
Iatrogenic botulism
Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can happen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches.
Adult intestinal toxemia
Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind of botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's intestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don't know why people get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut might be more likely to get ill.
All kinds of botulism can be fatal and are medical emergencies.
If you or your child has signs and symptoms of botulism, immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room. Do not wait.

Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)
EXPLORE TOPICS

MAY 10, 2024
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)
Also called Mad Cow Disease
WHAT TO KNOW
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal brain disease in cows that is caused by a prion. BSE caused a major outbreak in the 1980-90s, with cases reported in at least 24 countries. Most cases occurred in the United Kingdom, but many other countries also reported cases. Changes to feed policies have made BSE extremely rare now. However, animal health officials continue to monitor suspicious deaths in cows to watch for a potential BSE recurrence.
Causes and risk
BSE is caused by a prion, an infectious protein. Prions are misfolded forms of proteins normally found in the bodies of animals and people.
It typically takes years for symptoms to begin after an animal is infected with a prion.
Scientists believe BSE may have been caused by feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that contained prion-infected products from cows or sheep.
There is strong evidence the BSE outbreak grew and spread throughout the U.K. when such infected feed was given to young calves.
Outbreaks
The United Kingdom
The first two cases of BSE were identified in cows in 1986 in the United Kingdom. The cows were likely infected in the 1970s.
The U.K. quickly became the epicenter of the outbreak. Overall, more than 184,000 cows in the U.K. died from BSE between 1986 and 2015. The outbreak was widespread, with more than 35,000 U.K. herds affected.
Cases peaked in 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Cases deceased drastically after control measures were implemented. BSE cases are still reported occasionally but are very rare.
Other Countries
Outside the U.K., BSE was first reported in Ireland in 1989 and Portugal and Switzerland in 1990.
By 2005, the number of countries reporting BSE among native cattle increased to 24, with the majority in Europe.
North America
The first North American BSE case was reported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the UK. Rendered cohorts of this cow may have been responsible for 19 additional Canadian BSE cases beginning in 2003.
In addition, animal health officials have identified 6 BSE cases in cows in the United States. One was imported from Canada and is believed to have been infected there. The others were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed.
Control Measures
Animal health officials eventually determined BSE-infected cows had eaten feed made from other cows that died from prion disease. This led to feed bans in multiple countries, which drastically reduced the number of BSE cases reported.
Early efforts to control the BSE outbreak focused on culling (killing) sick animals to prevent them from entering the food chain.
The UK implemented the most stringent control measure - excluding animals >30 months old from the human and animal food supplies. It also included a ban on using meat from around the animals' spinal columns since prions affect the nervous system. The programs - along with bans in other countries - have prevented additional BSE outbreaks.
Occasional cases still occur, but they are very rare.
Risk to People
Strong evidence exists that consuming meat from BSE-infected cows causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people.
vCJD cases began in the U.K. about 10 years after BSE-contaminated beef likely made its way for an extended period into food produced for people. This is consistent with the time between when someone is exposed to a prion disease and when they develop one themselves.
As BSE has been largely eradicated, it is not thought to pose much risk to people currently.

About Naegleria fowleri Infections
KEY POINTS
Naegleria fowleri is a free-living ameba, a kind of one-celled organism that thrives in warm freshwater lakes, rivers, and hot springs.
It is often called the ""brain-eating ameba"" because it can infect the brain and destroy brain tissue.
Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri are very rare but nearly always fatal.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Naegleria fowleri lives in soil and warm freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs around the world.
In very rare cases, Naegleria fowleri has been found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. The ameba also has been found in tap water.
If water containing the ameba goes up the nose and to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone who gets PAM dies from it.
Between 1962 and 2023, there were 164 reported cases of PAM in the United States. Only four have survived.

Signs and symptoms
Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days.
As PAM progresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Naegleria fowleri Infection
Exposure risks
Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri usually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh water during summer months. Infections often happen when it's been hot for long periods, resulting in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.
A few infections have occurred when people used tap water that contained Naegleria fowleri to rinse their sinuses or cleanse their nasal passages.
In very rare instances, people have become infected from recreational water like splash pads and a surf park that did not have enough chlorine.
You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing water containing the ameba. You also can't get an infection from someone else or pass it on to others.
Keep Reading:
What Causes Naegleria fowleri Infection
Reducing risk
To help protect yourself against a Naegleria fowleri infection:
Hold your nose or wear a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into fresh water.
Always keep your head above water in hot springs.
Don't dig in shallow water because the ameba is more likely to live there.
Use distilled or boiled tap water when rinsing your sinuses or cleansing your nasal passages.
Keep Reading:
How to Prevent Naegleria fowleri Infection When Rinsing Sinuses or Nasal Passages
Diagnosis
A Naegleria fowleri infection is diagnosed using laboratory tests. These tests are available in only a few labs in the United States, including CDC.
Because these infections are so rare and hard to detect, diagnosis sometimes happens after a person has died.
Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of PAM.
Treatment and recovery
Naegleria fowleri can destroy brain tissue and cause the brain to swell. Unfortunately, more than 97% of people with PAM have died from the infection.
PAM progresses very quickly. This has made treatments for the disease difficult to identify. There is some evidence that certain drugs may be effective.
Keep Reading:
Clinical Care of Naegleria fowleri Infection
What CDC is doing
CDC's Free-Living and Intestinal Amebas Lab is one of only a few labs in the country that can identify Naegleria fowleri. It is experienced in diagnosing Naegleria fowleri infections and can provide results quickly.

About CDC's Naegleria fowleri Program
Free-living amebas
A free-living ameba is a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water and soil around the world. Most people will come into contact with these amebas during their lives but won't get sick. Others will develop rare but serious infections.
Although there are several types of free-living amebas that live in the environment, three are known to cause severe disease in people:
Acanthamoeba
Balamuthia mandrillaris
Naegleria fowleri
All of these amebas can cause life-threatening brain infections. Some can also cause infections of the eyes, skin, sinuses, and other parts of the body.

About Mammograms
KEY POINTS
A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast.
Doctors use a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer.
Regular mammograms can find breast cancer early, sometimes up to 3 years before it can be felt.
How a mammogram is done
You will stand in front of a special x-ray machine. A technologist will place your breast on a plastic plate. Another plate will firmly press your breast from above. The plates will flatten the breast, holding it still while the x-ray is being taken. You will feel some pressure. The steps are repeated to make a side view of the breast. The other breast will be x-rayed in the same way.
You will then wait while the technologist checks the x-rays to make sure the pictures do not need to be redone. Keep in mind that the technologist cannot tell you the results of your mammogram. Each woman's mammogram may look a little different because all breasts are a little different. A doctor with special training, called a radiologist, will look at the x-ray for early signs of breast cancer or other problems.
What a mammogram feels like
Having a mammogram is uncomfortable for most women. Some women find it painful. A mammogram takes only a few moments, though, and the discomfort is over soon. What you feel depends on the skill of the technologist, the size of your breasts, and how much they need to be pressed. Your breasts may be more sensitive if you are about to get or have your period.
Tips for getting a mammogram
Try not to have your mammogram the week before you get your period or during your period. Your breasts may be tender or swollen then.
On the day of your mammogram, don't wear deodorant, perfume, or powder. These products can show up as white spots on the X-ray.
Some women prefer to wear a top with a skirt or pants, instead of a dress. You will need to undress from your waist up for the mammogram.
Are you worried about the cost?
CDC offers free or low-cost mammograms through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.
Find out if you qualify.
About the results
When will I get the results of my mammogram?
You will usually get the results within a few weeks, although it depends on the facility. A radiologist reads your mammogram and then reports the results to you and your doctor. If there is a concern, you will hear from the mammography facility earlier. Contact your health care provider or the mammography facility if you do not receive a report of your results within 30 days.
What happens if my mammogram is normal?
Continue to get mammograms according to recommended time intervals. Mammograms work best when they can be compared with previous ones. This allows the radiologist to compare them to look for changes in your breasts.
What happens if my mammogram is abnormal?
An abnormal mammogram does not always mean that there is cancer. But you may need to have additional mammograms, tests, or exams before the doctor can tell for sure. You may also be referred to a breast specialist or a surgeon. It does not necessarily mean you have cancer or need surgery. These doctors are experts in diagnosing breast problems. Doctors will do follow-up tests to diagnose breast cancer or to find that there is no cancer.

About Breastfeeding
KEY POINTS
Breastfeeding is the best source of nutrition for most infants.
Breastfeeding can reduce the risk of certain health conditions for both infants and mothers.
About 1 in 4 infants is exclusively breastfed as recommended until they are 6 months old.
CDC supports and promotes breastfeeding across the United States.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Breastfeeding benefits babies and mothers
Infants who are breastfed have reduced risk of:
Asthma.
Severe lower respiratory disease.
Obesity.
Type 1 diabetes.
Acute otitis media (ear infections).
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
Gastrointestinal infections, which can cause diarrhea and vomiting.
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
(death of intestinal tissue) for preterm infants.
Breastfeeding can help lower a mother's risk for:
High blood pressure.
Type 2 diabetes.
Ovarian cancer.
Breast cancer.
Support for breastfeeding
Breastfeeding is the clinical gold standard for infant feeding and nutrition. We must do more to create supportive and safe environments for mothers who choose to breastfeed.—Dr. Ruth Petersen, director of CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity
What CDC is doing
We work with state and local organizations to improve continuity of care in breastfeeding. Quality, consistent care over time includes hospital initiatives, worksite accommodation, and community support initiatives. We also collect data to track progress.
We promote best practices in health care settings by:
Supporting the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding
, a global standard to promote breastfeeding in hospitals.
Encouraging obstetricians, pediatricians, and nurses to educate new mothers about breastfeeding.
We support mothers at work and in their communities by:
Partnering with states to help employers support breastfeeding mothers with:
Places to pump and store breast milk.
Flexible work hours.
Maternity leave benefits.
Promoting access to community supports such as peer counseling and supplemental nutrition programs.
Supporting policies and practices in early care and education settings to make it easier for mothers to continue to breastfeed their children.
We collect data to learn how best to improve breastfeeding rates in the United States by:
Tracking how long infants are breastfed.
Creating reports that show how well states and hospitals support breastfeeding mothers.
Family support can make a difference in whether and for how long infants are breastfed.
Breastfeeding statistics
About 1 in 4 infants are exclusively breastfed as recommended by the time they are 6 months old.
Low rates of breastfeeding add more than $3 billion a year to U.S. medical costs for the mother and child.
Three-quarters (75%) of Black infants are ever breastfed, which is below the national average of 84%.
Milestones
In the United States:
The percentage of babies who start out breastfeeding increased from 73% in 2004 to 84% in 2021.
The percentage of births in hospitals with recommended maternity care practices that support breastfeeding increased from 3.8% in 2010 to 28.9% in 2021.
Make breastfeeding easier
Only through the support of family, communities, clinicians, health care systems, and employers will we be able to make breastfeeding the easy choice.—Dr. Jerome M. Adams, U.S. Surgeon General (2017-2021)

Bromine
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Bromine is a naturally occurring element that is a liquid at room temperature.
Signs and symptoms of bromine poisoning depend on how you were exposed.
Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed.
Background
Bromine is a naturally occurring element that is a liquid at room temperature.
It has a brownish-red color and smells like bleach. It dissolves in water.
Where it is found
Bromine is found naturally in the earth's crust and in seawater. Bromine can also be found as another option to chlorine in swimming pools.
Products with bromine are used in agriculture, sanitation and as fire retardants (chemicals that help prevent things from catching fire).
Some bromine-containing products were historically used as sedatives (drugs that can make people calm or sleepy). However, these drugs are for the most part no longer found on the market in the United States.
How it works
Bromine can irritate the skin and tissues, including the tissues that make mucus in your mouth and nose.
Signs and symptoms
The level of bromine poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and medical conditions they may have.
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to bromine.
If breathed in:
Cough
Trouble breathing
Headache
Irritation of your mucous membranes (inside your mouth, nose, etc.)
Dizziness
Watery eyes
If exposed to skin:
Skin irritation and burns
Cooling sensation closely followed by a burning feeling
If swallowed in large amounts:
Nausea
Vomiting
Swallowing compounds (combinations of bromine with other chemicals) with bromine causes different effects depending on the compound.
Exposure
You can be exposed by:
Drinking water with bromine in it
Eating food with bromine in it
Breathing in bromine gas
Touching bromine gas or liquid
Bromine gas is heavier than air, so it would settle in low-lying areas.
What to do if you are exposed
First, get fresh air by leaving the area where the bromine was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chances of negative health effects from bromine.
If the bromine was released outdoors, move away from the area where the bromine was released. Go to the highest ground possible, because bromine is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas. If bromine was released indoors, get out of the building.
When immediate care is needed
If you swallowed bromine, do not force vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
If you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any bromine from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.
For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit ""About Getting Clean.""
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a bromine release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Evacuation.""
For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Sheltering in Place.""
Treatment
The most important thing is for people to get away from the exposure and seek medical treatment as soon as possible.
No specific cure exists for bromine poisoning.
Bromine poisoning is treated with supportive medical care in a hospital. Supportive medical care can include providing medicine, oxygen, and intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle into your vein).
Long-term health effects
Survivors of serious poisoning caused by breathing in bromine may have long-term lung problems.
Survivors may also have long-term effects from systemic poisoning (poisoning that affects the whole body instead of a specific spot). An example of a long-term effect is kidney or brain damage from low blood pressure.

Riot Control Agents
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that cause irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Several different compounds are riot control agents:
Chloroacetophenone (CN)
Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS)
Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant
Bromobenzylcyanide (CA)
Dibenzoxazepine (CR)
Combinations of various agents.
Where it is found
Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray).
CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks.
How it works
Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure.
The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off.
Signs and symptoms
The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors).
People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure:
Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness
Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling
Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling
Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath
Skin: burns, rash
Other: nausea and vomiting
Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as:
Blindness
Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess
Immediate death due to severe chemical burns to the throat and lungs
Respiratory failure possibly resulting in death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to riot control agents.
Exposure
Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles.
If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in.
What to do if you are exposed
Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents.
If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground.
If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe.
Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes.
Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages.
No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents.
Long-term health effects
Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following:
Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness)
Eye scarring
Cataracts
Breathing problems, such as asthma
These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors.
If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

About RSV
WHAT TO KNOW
RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms.
Infants and older adults are more likely to develop severe RSV and need hospitalization.
CDC recommends immunizations to protect infants, some young children, and older adults.
What is RSV?
Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that infects the nose, throat, and lungs. RSV symptoms make it difficult to distinguish it from the common cold or other respiratory viruses (like the flu or COVID-19). RSV spreads in the fall and winter along with other respiratory viruses. It usually peaks in December and January.

How RSV Spreads
RSV can be dangerous for infants and older adults
RSV does not usually cause severe illness in healthy adults and children. However, some people with RSV infection, especially older adults and infants younger than 6 months of age, can become very sick and may need to be hospitalized.
RSV can also cause more severe illness such as bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lungs) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs). It is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age.
In the most severe cases, a person may require:
Additional oxygen,
IV fluids if they can't drink enough to stay hydrated, or
Intubation (have a breathing tube inserted through the mouth and down to the airway) with mechanical ventilation (a machine to help a person breathe).
In most of these cases, hospitalization lasts only a few days.
Learn more about people at high risk for severe RSV infection.

About Brucellosis
KEY POINTS
Brucellosis is a disease caused by bacteria.
The disease spreads to people through contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.
People in certain jobs or settings that work with animals or animal products may face increased exposure to the bacteria that cause brucellosis.
Brucellosis can be treated with antibiotics.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a family of bacteria called Brucella.
You can get the disease when you come in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that most commonly get brucellosis include cats, dogs, sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hogs, among others. People can get brucellosis by:
Eating undercooked meat such as sheep, cow, goat, or camel.
Eating undercooked game meat such as bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hog.
Consuming unpasteurized (raw) milk or other dairy products made from contaminated milk.
Breathing in the bacteria that cause brucellosis.
Getting body fluids from infected animals in the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Preparing meat or hides after hunting.
Getting certain animal vaccines in the eyes, nose or mouth or accidentally injecting yourself when vaccinating animals
Working in a lab with brucellosis samples.
People with certain jobs or hobbies may face increased exposure to the bacteria that cause brucellosis, including:
Slaughterhouse workers
Hunters
Veterinarians and veterinary staff
Animal breeders or animal shelter staff
Laboratory workers
It is extremely rare for brucellosis to spread between people.
Signs and symptoms
Doctors examining a patient
If you think you've been exposed to brucellosis, contact your health care provider.
Brucellosis can cause a range of signs and symptoms in people, and some can occur for a long time before it's diagnosed. The first symptoms can include:
Fever
Sweating
Generally feeling badly (malaise)
Not wanting to eat (anorexia)
Headache
Pain in muscles, joint, and/or back
Feeling more tired than usual (fatigue)
Other symptoms may continue or may come and go until you've had treatment, including:
Fevers that keep coming back
Arthritis
Swelling of the testicles and scrotum area
Infection of the heart (endocarditis)
Memory loss, confusion, and irritability
Depression
Swelling of the liver and/or spleen
Prevention
Eating or drinking infected animal products
The best way to prevent brucellosis infection is to be sure you don't eat or drink:
Undercooked meat
Unpasteurized (raw) dairy products, including milk, cheese, and ice cream
Pasteurization is the heating process used to destroy harmful bacteria that may make milk and milk products unsafe to eat or drink.
If you are not sure whether a dairy product is pasteurized, don't eat or drink it.
Hunters and those who work with animals
People who work with animal tissues and body fluids, including animal caretakers (veterinarians, vet techs, shelter staff, etc.), hunters, butchers, and animal herdsman, are at higher risk of brucellosis infection. If you work with animal tissues, protect yourself by wearing:
Rubber gloves
Goggles
Gowns or aprons
Masks or respirators
View Larger
Protect yourself while working with animal tissues
If the animal is infected, this protective clothing will help keep the bacteria that causes brucellosis from getting into your eyes or inside a cut or wound on your skin.
Laboratory personnel
Brucellosis is the most commonly reported laboratory-associated bacterial infection. If you work in a lab, take precautions when handling samples to prevent infection. If you are exposed, determine your risk and follow recommendations for symptom monitoring and possible post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment.
Treatment and recovery
Once your healthcare provider has confirmed that you have brucellosis from test results, you can begin treatment with antibiotics.
Your doctor will decide which antibiotics you'll get for a minimum of 6-8 weeks. To be sure you get the right medicines for you, let your healthcare providers know if you are:
Pregnant
Allergic to doxycycline or rifampin
Are immunosuppressed from medical conditions or other medicines
Brucella RB51 treatment
If you have with an infection from a strain of Brucella called RB51 from consuming infected animal products, you'll need antibiotics other than rifampin. This particular strain of Brucella is resistant to it, meaning rifampin will not treat the infection.
It's important that you take all your medicines when being treated for brucellosis. If you're not properly treated, the infection can become chronic and lead to long-term disease associated with arthritis, endocarditis, chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver or spleen.
Depending on the timing of treatment and how sick you are, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare and only happens in less than 2% of cases.

Youth Violence Prevention
EXPLORE TOPICS

OCTOBER 28, 2024
Bullying
KEY POINTS
Bullying is a type of violence experienced by youth and it can happen in person and through technology.
Bullying is widespread in the United States and causes harm to youth.
Preventing bullying involves teaching kids safe ways to stand up against it and enhancing their interpersonal skills, like empathy and conflict management.
What is bullying?
CDC defines bullying as any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths, who are not siblings or current dating partners. It involves an observed or perceived power imbalance, and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated.
Bullying may inflict harm or distress on the victim including physical, psychological, social, or educational harm. Common types of bullying include:
Physical such as hitting, kicking, and tripping.
Verbal including name-calling and teasing.
Relational or social such as spreading rumors and leaving out of the group.
Damage to victim's property.
Bullying can also occur through technology, called electronic bullying or cyberbullying. A young person can be a perpetrator, a victim, or both (also known as a ""bully/victim"").
Quick facts and stats
Bullying is an adverse childhood experience that is widespread in the United States. Bullying harms all youth involved including those who are bullied, those who bully others, and bystanders who witness it.
Bullying is common. About one in five high school students reported being bullied on school property in the past year. More than one in six high school students reported being bullied electronically in the past year including through texting and social media.1
Some youth experience bullying more than others. Female students were more likely than male students to experience bullying, both on school property and electronically.
Additionally, Asian students and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than Hispanic, White, and Multiracial students to be bullied at school. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than students from most other racial and ethnic groups to be electronically bullied.1
Bullying is a frequent discipline problem. A national survey found that 28% of middle schools, 15% of high schools, and 10% of elementary schools reported the occurrence of bullying at school at least once a week. About 37% of middle schools reported the occurrence of cyberbullying at least once a week, followed by 25% of high schools and 6% of elementary schools.2
Warning signs
Not all children who are bullied show warning signs, but StopBullying.gov
suggests being aware of these common signs:
Unexplained injuries.
Lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry.
Frequent headaches or stomachaches, feeling sick, or faking illness.
Difficulty sleeping or frequent nightmares.
Declining grades, loss of interest in schoolwork, or not wanting to go to school.
Outcomes
Bullying can result in physical injury, social and emotional distress, self-harm, and even death. It also increases the risk for depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, lower academic achievement, and dropping out of school.
Youth who bully others are at increased risk for substance misuse, academic problems, and experiencing violence later in adolescence and adulthood.3 Youth who bully others and are bullied themselves suffer the most serious consequences and are at greater risk for mental health and behavioral problems.
Prevention
We all have a role to play in preventing bullying. Youth and adults play important roles in preventing violence and creating safe communities where young people can thrive.
A bystander (someone who witnesses bullying, either in person or online) can make a positive impact by becoming an upstander. An upstander is someone who sees what happens and intervenes, interrupts, or speaks up to stop the bullying. Learn more about becoming an upstander
and take action against bullying.
Parents, school staff, and other caring adults can:
Help kids understand bullying and how to stand up to it safely.
Keep the lines of communication open by checking in with kids often and listening to them.
Encourage kids to do what they love so they can build confidence and make friends.
Model how to treat others with kindness and respect.
See Also:
Stopbullying.gov: How to prevent bullying
Additionally, school-based programs that strengthen youths' interpersonal and emotional skills, including empathy, conflict management, and teamwork, can reduce bullying. Explore example program resources.
All young people deserve to grow up safely and thrive. We can all be upstanders and help stop bullying in our communities.

Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
APRIL 15, 2024
About Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers
AT A GLANCE
Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of diseases that are caused by several distinct families of viruses.
The term ""viral hemorrhagic fever"" refers to a condition where many of the body's organ systems are affected, the overall cardiovascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to function on its own is reduced.
In addition to VHFs, there are serious infectious diseases like Nipah and Hendra diseases that also require a specialized laboratory, are highly pathogenic, and have no, or limited, vaccine or treatment currently available.
VHFs, Nipah and Hendra disease can cause relatively mild illness or more life-threatening disease. Symptoms can vary but may include bleeding or hemorrhaging. Distribution of these viruses is determined by where the animals that naturally carry them live.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Types
Most VHFs fall into one of four families of virus:
Arenaviruses
Each arenavirus has one or a few closely related rodents that carry the virus without getting sick themselves. This is known as the reservoir, or source of the virus in nature. The reservoir can spread the virus to people through infected urine, saliva, or droppings, and can cause severe disease in people.
People are infected with arenaviruses by:
Touching with rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials from an infected rodent
Breathing in air contaminated by rodent urine, droppings or nesting materials.
Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent.
Eating food contaminated by urine, droppings, or saliva from an infected rodent.
Contact with another person who has certain arenaviruses, such as Chapare, Lassa, Machupo, and Lujo viruses.
Bunyavirales order
Viruses in the Bunyavirales order are spread by rodents or insects, such as mosquitos, ticks, or sand flies. They can produce mild to severe disease in animals and people. Many of these viruses cannot spread between people. However, person-to-person spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has occurred in healthcare settings where infection control was limited.
Filoviruses
Filoviruses can cause severe illness in people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and gorillas). The Egyptian rousette bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is a cave-dwelling bat, and the reservoir for Marburg virus. Bats infected with orthomarburgviruses do not show obvious signs of illness. It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that bats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they can spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Caretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection.
Flaviviruses
Flaviviruses, are found throughout the world. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to severe disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large economic and social impact on people living in affected areas.
Paramyxoviruses
Paramyxoviruses can cause sudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within the Paramyxoviridae family, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because they require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.

Prevention
Prevention of VHFs and other HCIDs depends on the host reservoir and how the virus spreads. Prevention measures can target reservoir exclusion activities (for example, use of insect repellents, bed nets, and protective clothing and disinfection procedures while caring for a sick person) or by sealing up and setting traps in homes and other buildings when a rodent infestation is discovered.

Estimates of Foodborne Illness in the United States
Print
CDC’s estimates of the burden of foodborne illness in the United States provide the most accurate picture of known pathogens and unspecified agents causing foodborne illness in the United States.
These estimates serve as a foundation for food safety by allowing us to answer important questions, such as:
How many foodborne illnesses occur every year?
These estimates are known as the burden of foodborne illness.
Which foods are responsible for the illnesses?
These estimates are known as the attribution of foodborne illness.
By estimating the burden of foodborne illness and attributing illnesses to specific food sources, CDC, regulatory agencies, industry, consumer groups, and others can better target prevention measures and improve food safety in the United States.

APRIL 11, 2024
About Burkholderia cepacia complex
KEY POINTS
Burkholderia cepacia complex, also called B. cepacia or Bcc, is a group of bacteria that can cause infections in healthcare settings.
Good infection control practices, including around the use of water, can help reduce infection risk.
B. cepacia germs can be resistant to antibiotics, making them difficult to treat.
What it is
Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of bacteria commonly found in soil and water.
Symptoms
Symptoms vary, ranging from no symptoms to serious respiratory infections, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung disease. Other symptoms may include:
Fever
Fatigue
At-risk populations
In the United States, people in healthcare settings and those with weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis, are at highest risk of infection with B. cepacia complex.
B. cepacia complex poses little medical risk to healthy people.
How it spreads
Exposure from water, soil or aqueous (watery) environments.
Contact with contaminated surfaces.
Contact with contaminated equipment.
Person-to-person transmission, more commonly in patients with cystic fibrosis.
Reducing risk
Patients and caregivers should:
Keep their hands clean, particularly before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device.
Ask others to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
Avoid exposing wounds and indwelling medical devices (devices put in or connected to the patient's body) to nonsterile water.
Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting.
Healthcare providers should always follow recommended infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Treatment
Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis but generally include antibiotics. Unfortunately, many B. cepacia complex germs are resistant to antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.

About Melioidosis
KEY POINTS
Melioidosis is a bacterial infection in people and animals.
Melioidosis is spread through contact with contaminated soil, air, or water.
Cases may increase after hurricanes, heavy rain, and other severe weather events.
The disease is often confused for other conditions, making diagnosis difficult.
Melioidosis is treated with antibiotics.
MORE INFORMATION

Public Health
Overview
Melioidosis is caused by bacteria called Burkholderia pseudomallei, or B. pseudomallei. It's spread to people and animals through direct contact with soil, air, or water contaminated by the bacteria. Cases may increase after hurricanes, heavy rain, and other severe weather events because the bacteria rise to the surface of the soil.
People can get melioidosis by:
Breathing in contaminated dust or water droplets
Having contact with contaminated soil or water, especially through skin breaks (cuts, scrapes, etc.)
It's very rare for people to get the disease from another person.
Many kinds of animals can get melioidosis, including:
Sheep
Goats
Pigs, hogs, boar
Horses
Cats
Dogs
Cows
B. pseudomallei is mostly found in tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where it causes widespread melioidosis. In the United States, B. pseudomallei occurs in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Gulf Coast area of the state of Mississippi. Most melioidosis illnesses in the United States occur in people who have traveled to areas where the disease is more common. Some cases have also occurred in people who have had contact with contaminated products made overseas.
Signs and symptoms
Melioidosis has a wide range of signs and symptoms. You usually develop symptoms of melioidosis within 1 to 4 weeks after you've been exposed to it. Some cases have developed symptoms months or years after exposure. The disease can affect one body system or affect the entire body. Because of these factors, melioidosis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for other diseases.
Sometimes the illness is just in one area (localized), and it may look like an ulcer or skin sore. You might have a fever, swelling, and muscle aches.
Most often, melioidosis shows up as a lung infection. You might have a cough, chest pain, high fever, headache, and you might not feel like eating.
Whether you've just come down with melioidosis or you've had it for a long time, it can affect different organ systems throughout the body (disseminated infection). It can cause problems with the liver, spleen, prostate, joints, bones, lymph nodes, skin, or brain. Melioidosis can lead to a dangerous bloodstream infection (sepsis).
Symptoms of disseminated infection include:
Fever
Headache
Trouble breathing
Stomach or chest pain
Muscle pain
Confusion
Seizure
Risk factors
Although healthy people may get melioidosis, having the following medical conditions may increase your risk:
Diabetes
Heavy alcohol use
Liver disease
Kidney disease
Thalassemia (a blood disorder)
Cancer, or another condition that weakens the immune system
Chronic lung disease, like cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or bronchiectasis
Certain activities also may increase your risk of being exposed to the bacteria that causes melioidosis, including:
Travel to areas where the disease is common.
Breathing in contaminated water droplets or soil dust that get into the air after severe weather like hurricanes or heavy rainfall.
Hobbies or jobs that could put you in contact with contaminated soil or water.
Drinking unchlorinated or untreated drinking water.
Reducing risk
In areas where the disease is widespread, contact with contaminated soil or water can put people at risk for melioidosis. To help lower the risk of exposure:
If you have open skin wounds, or if you have chronic conditions like diabetes or kidney disease, avoid contact with soil and standing water.
If you perform agricultural work or have hobbies or jobs that raise your risk of exposure, wear boots, which can prevent infection through your feet and lower legs.
Healthcare workers can use standard precautions when treating patients with melioidosis to help prevent infection. They should also label samples appropriately if they suspect melioidosis to protect lab personnel.
Laboratory personnel should follow good laboratory practices, including using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protection.
Treatment and recovery
If you are diagnosed with melioidosis, doctors will decide how long you'll need treatment based on how bad the infection is. Treatment generally includes:
Intravenous (in the vein) antibiotics from 2 to 8 weeks, followed by
Oral (pills by mouth) antibiotics for 3 to 6 months
It's important to complete your treatment so that the infection goes away completely.
What CDC is doing
One reason public health authorities study the disease is because the bacteria that cause melioidosis might be used as a weapon in a biological attack. A biological attack is the intentional release of pathogens (germs) that can sicken or kill people, livestock, or crops.
We don't know if this kind of attack will ever happen. CDC and other federal agencies prepare for many of biological attacks to protect as many people as possible.

Melioidosis and Bioterrorism
CDC works with state, tribal, local, and territorial agencies to investigate potential cases of melioidosis. Among other cases, in 2021, CDC linked four cases of melioidosis in patients from Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas. A public health investigation eventually linked all cases to a commercially imported product from a melioidosis-endemic country that each of the patients used in their homes.
B. pseudomallei was recently found to occur naturally in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. CDC is working with health departments to learn more about how widespread the bacteria is and what impact it's having on health.
