Why get vaccinated?
Rabies vaccine can prevent rabies.
Rabies is a serious illness that almost always results in death.
Rabies virus infects the central nervous system. Symptoms may occur from days to years after exposure to the virus and include delirium (confusion), abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia (difficulty sleeping), which precede coma and death.
People can get rabies if they have contact with the saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal, for example through a bite or scratch, and do not receive appropriate medical care, including rabies vaccine.
Rabies vaccine
Certain people with a higher risk for rabies exposures, such as those who work with potentially infected animals, are recommended to receive vaccine to help prevent rabies if an exposure happens. If you are at higher risk of exposure to the rabies virus:
You should receive 2 doses of rabies vaccine given on days 0 and 7.
Depending on your level of risk, you may be advised to have one or more blood tests or receive a booster dose within 3 years after the first 2 doses. Your health care provider can give you more details.
Rabies vaccine can prevent rabies if given to a person after an exposure. After an exposure or potential exposure to rabies, the wound site should be thoroughly cleaned with soap and water. If your health care provider or local health department recommend vaccination, the vaccine should be given as soon as possible after an exposure but may be effective any time before symptoms begin. Once symptoms begin, rabies vaccine is no longer helpful in preventing rabies.
If you have not been vaccinated against rabies in the past, you need 4 doses of rabies vaccine over 2 weeks (given on days 0, 3, 7, and 14). You should also get another medication called rabies immunoglobulin on the day you receive the first dose of rabies vaccine or soon afterwards.
If you have received rabies vaccination in the past, you typically need only 2 doses of rabies vaccine after an exposure.
Rabies vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.
Talk with your health care provider
Tell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine:
Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of rabies vaccine, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies
Has a weakened immune system
Is taking or plans to take chloroquine or a drug related to chloroquine
Has received rabies vaccine in the past (your provider will need to know when you received any rabies vaccine doses in the past)
In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone routine (pre-exposure) rabies vaccination until a future visit. Or your health care provider may perform a blood test before or after rabies vaccines are given to determine your level of immunity against rabies.
People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting a routine (pre-exposure) dose of rabies vaccine. If you have been exposed to rabies virus, you should get vaccinated regardless of concurrent illnesses, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or weakened immune system.
Your health care provider can give you more information.
Risks of a vaccine reaction
Soreness, redness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection, and headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, or dizziness can happen after rabies vaccine.
Hives, pain in the joints, or fever sometimes happen after booster doses.
People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.
As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.
What if there is a serious problem?
An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital.
For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider.
Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website
or call 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice.
How can I learn more?
Ask your health care provider.
Call your local or state health department.
Visit the website of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for vaccine package inserts and additional information.
Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) or

Raccoon Roundworm (Baylisascaris Infection)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
PARASITES 
NOVEMBER 5, 2024
About Raccoon Roundworm
KEY POINTS
Raccoon roundworm is an intestinal parasitic infection caused by Baylisascaris worms.
You can get raccoon roundworm when you consume infectious eggs, usually accidentally.
Infections in people are rare, but the parasite can infect other animals, like dogs.
Overview
Baylisascaris infection is caused by a roundworm found in raccoons. This roundworm can infect people as well as a variety of other animals, including dogs. Human infections are rare but can be severe if the parasites invade the eye (ocular larva migrans), organs (visceral larva migrans) or the brain (neural larva migrans).
Species
Different species of Baylisascaris are associated with different animal hosts. For example, Baylisascaris procyonis is found in raccoons, and Baylisascaris columnaris is found in skunks. Cases of Baylisascaris infection in people are not frequently reported but can be severe. Baylisascaris procyonis is thought to pose the greatest risk to people because of the often-close association of raccoons to human dwellings.
Symptoms
The incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms) is usually 1 – 4 weeks. If present, signs and symptoms can include
Nausea
Tiredness
Liver enlargement
Loss of coordination
Lack of attention to people and surroundings
Loss of muscle control
Blindness
Coma
Causes and spread
People become infected by consuming infectious eggs. Most infections are in children and others who are more likely to put dirt or animal waste in their mouth by mistake.
Prevention
Eggs passed in raccoon feces are not immediately infectious. In the environment, eggs take 2 – 4 weeks to become infectious. If raccoons have set up a den or a latrine (places where raccoons defecate) in your yard, raccoon feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed carefully and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill. Care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes. Treat decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane flame-gun (exercise proper precautions). Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces before the eggs become infectious will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection.
Do not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets.
Washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases.
Diagnosis
You should discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask you questions (for example, about your interactions with raccoons or other wild animals). Baylisascaris infection is difficult to diagnosis in humans. There are no widely available tests, so the diagnosis is often made by ruling out other diseases.
Treatment
A healthcare provider can discuss treatment options with you. No drug has been found to be completely effective against raccoon roundworm in people. Albendazole, a broad spectrum anthelmintic, has been recommended for specific cases.
Early treatment might reduce serious damage caused by the infection. If you suspect you may have ingested raccoon feces, seek immediate medical attention.

PARASITES 
JUNE 24, 2024
About Rat Lungworm Disease
KEY POINTS
Angiostrongylus is a parasite found in rats. It is also called rat lungworm.
People can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite.
Most people infected with rat lungworm recover on their own without treatment.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a parasitic worm of rats. It is also called the rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite is found only in rodents. Infected rats pass larvae of the parasite in their feces. Snails and slugs get infected by ingesting the larvae. These larvae mature in snails and slugs but do not become adult worms. The life cycle is completed when rats eat infected snails or slugs and the larvae further mature to become adult worms.
Species
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which is also known as the rat lungworm, causes eosinophilic meningitis and is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands. The recognized distribution of the parasite has been increasing over time and infections have been identified in other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States.
Angiostrongylus costaricensis causes eosinophilic gastroenteritis and is found in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Symptoms
Some infected people don’t have any symptoms—or have only mild symptoms that don’t last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of meningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting.
How it spreads
People can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. In some cultures, snails are commonly eaten. Some children, in particular, have gotten infected by swallowing snails/slugs ""on a dare. "" People also can get infected by accident, by eating raw produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one.
Certain animals such freshwater shrimp, crabs, or frogs, have been found to be infected with larvae of the parasite. African land snails, which can grow larger than a person’s hand, is just one of many types that can be infected. But snails can be infected only if they have ingested contaminated rat feces.
It is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are infected could result in people becoming infected, though the evidence for this is not as clear as for eating infected snails and slugs. Of note, fish do not spread this parasite.
Resource
This video illustrates how people get infected with A. cantonensis or rat lungworm.


Prevention
Don’t eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear gloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When travelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables.
Testing and diagnosis
See your healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask about any symptoms, travel, and exposures you’ve had (for example, to snails/slugs). You might have some blood tests, as well as tests for meningitis.
Treatment
The parasite dies over time, even without treatment. Even people who develop eosinophilic meningitis usually don’t need antiparasitics. Sometimes the symptoms of the infection last for several weeks or months, while the body’s immune system responds to the dying parasites. The most common types of treatment are for the symptoms of the infection, such as pain medication for headache or medications to reduce the body’s reaction to the parasite, rather than for the infection itself. Patients with severe cases of meningitis may benefit from some other types of treatment.

Rat-bite Fever (RBF)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
JULY 9, 2024
About Rat Bite Fever (RBF)
KEY POINTS
Rat-bite fever (RBF) is an infectious disease people can get from contact with rodents.
Anyone can get RBF, but having pet rodents or working with rodents may increase your risk.
If you have RBF symptoms and had recent contact with rodents, see a healthcare provider immediately.
RBF must be treated quickly, or it can cause severe illness and possibly death.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Anyone can get RBF if they have contact with rodents infected with the bacteria that cause RBF. Certain groups of people are more at risk for this serious and sometimes deadly disease.
The rodents that carry RBF include rats, mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, and squirrels. The bacteria that cause RBF is part of the natural germs in these rodents' bodies. Rodents that are carrying the bacteria that cause RBF do not show signs of illness, so it's not possible to tell if a rodent carries the bacteria just by looking at it.
If you know you were bitten or scratched by a rodent, and you develop symptoms consistent with RBF, you should seek medical care immediately. The infection is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. Getting treatment with the right antibiotics is important to keep the disease from progressing.
Thankfully, RBF is rare in the United States. But you should know many of these rodents that can carry it are popular pets, which can put people at risk. People who work in pet stores or labs with rodents also could be at higher risk.
Symptoms
The early symptoms of RBF can be like the flu. If you were infected by contact with rodents in North America, symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. About half of people will also have joint pain or swelling, and 3 in 4 will develop a rash.
Symptoms usually begin 3 to 10 days after your contact with rodents. They can appear up to 21 days after the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard to remember you were bitten.
Within 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear on the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or more joints may then become swollen, red, or painful.
The bacteria that cause RBF in Asia can be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by contact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, swelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of RBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health.
Complications
Complications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system.
Early treatment with antibiotics is important to try to prevent complications of RBF. These complications can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. These complications are rare but can be very serious and even deadly.
How it spreads
RBF can spread to people through scratches, bites, or contact with a rodent's saliva or pee. It can also spread by having contact with contaminated materials (rat bedding, cages, etc.), kissing pet rats, or eating or drinking contaminated food or drinks. RBF transmission does not necessarily require contact with rodents.
If you have pet rodents or handle rodents as feed for snakes/reptiles, you can be at increased risk for RBF. Other at risk include people who work at pet stores or laboratories where they may have contact with rodents.
Although rare, some animals like dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits can be infected by contact with infected rodents and then pass the infection on to people. People usually start to show signs they are sick 3-10 days after exposure. RBF cannot spread between people.
Prevention
You can lower your risk for RBF by avoiding contact with rodents, places with rodent infestations, or other areas where rodents may be present.
Although RBF is rare, it is important to take precautions and practice good hygiene when handling or coming into contact with rodents or potentially contaminated materials.
If you have pet rodents, handle rodents as feed for reptiles, or work with rodents in a pet store or laboratory, protect yourself from RBF by following CDC's small mammal guidance.
Quick facts
Quick facts
If you think you might have RBF, you should see your doctor immediately
Treatment and recovery
If you develop signs or symptoms of RBF, immediately contact a healthcare provider. Make sure to tell your provider about your contact with rodents.
Antibiotics can cure the disease if treatment is started soon after you become sick. It is important that you follow your healthcare provider's instructions. Take all of the medicine prescribed to you, even if you start to feel better.
These courses of treatment are very effective but if for some reason your symptoms worsen, see your health care provider immediately.

Raw Milk
WHAT TO KNOW
Pasteurization is crucial for milk safety, killing harmful germs that can cause illness.
Consuming raw milk can lead to serious health risks, especially for certain vulnerable populations.
Choosing pasteurized milk and dairy products is the best way to safely enjoy the nutritional benefits of milk.
Overview
Raw milk and A(H5N1) virus
CDC recommends against consuming raw milk contaminated with live A(H5N1) virus as a way to develop antibodies against A(H5N1) virus to protect against future disease. Consuming raw milk could make you sick.
Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized, a process that removes disease-causing germs by heating milk to a high enough temperature for a certain length of time. It's important to understand that raw milk can be a source of foodborne illness. While good practices on farms can reduce contamination, they cannot guarantee safety from harmful germs. Pasteurized milk offers the same nutritional benefits without the risks of raw milk consumption. Since the early 1900s, pasteurization has greatly reduced milk-borne illnesses.
Risk
Drinking or eating products made from raw milk can expose people to germs such as Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Listeria, Brucella, and Salmonella.
Some groups, such as children under 5, adults over 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, are at a higher risk of serious illness from these germs.
Symptoms
Symptoms of foodborne illness from raw milk can include diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. In some cases, more severe outcomes like Guillain-Barré syndrome or hemolytic uremic syndrome can occur, potentially leading to paralysis, kidney failure, stroke, or even death.
Prevention
Choose pasteurized milk and dairy products, making sure to read labels carefully.
Refrigerate perishable foods at 40°F or colder to slow bacterial growth. Bacteria can multiply rapidly if left at room temperature or in the “Danger Zone” between 40°F and 140°F. Never leave perishable food out for more than 2 hours (or 1 hour if exposed to temperatures above 90°F, like in a hot car or at a picnic).
Throw away expired or spoiled food. When in doubt, throw it out.

Registry Plus Software
WHAT TO KNOW
Registry Plus is a suite of publicly available free software programs for collecting and processing cancer registry data. The Registry Plus suite can be used separately or together for routine or special data collection.
Background
CDC provides Registry Plus software programs to implement the National Program of Cancer Registries, established by Public Law 102-515.
Hardware requirements
Registry Plus programs work with 32- and 64-bit Microsoft® Windows® operating systems on x86-compatible processors. For complete hardware requirements, please see Registry Plus Central Registry Tools Systems and IT Personnel Requirements.
Technical support
In the United States
Central cancer registries are the primary intended users of Registry Plus. CDC helps states set up the software and perform basic customization. Periodic software updates and problem solving are also provided to the extent of available resources. Our support is provided exclusively by telephone and email. CDC is not staffed to provide on-site services, nor can we support hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or other private users.
Some components of Registry Plus—Abstract Plus, for example—are intended for redistribution after customization. A central registry or other institution redistributing Registry Plus software should provide all support to end users and develop expertise in using the software among its own staff. Other users of Registry Plus software should contract, hire, or develop capability independently to understand and maintain the software applications. Contact your central cancer registry.
Non-NPCR organizations should refer to the Policy and Letter of Agreement for Use of CDC-Developed Software by Users External to the National Program of Cancer Registries.
Outside the United States
The Registry Plus Development group is funded primarily to support NPCR-funded central cancer registries, and cannot offer implementation support for Registry Plus products to other countries. However, you are free to download the programs and implement them using other resources.
For more information, please refer to the Policy and Letter of Agreement for Use of CDC-Developed Software by Users External to the National Program of Cancer Registries.
Please note that data items and codes in Abstract Plus are in English, and are based on North American Assiocation of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) Standards for Cancer Registries, Volume II, Data Standards and Data Dictionary.

Public Information Collection Activities
KEY POINTS
Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires all federal agencies to obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget before collecting information from the public.
Read about the PRA and the enforcement of the act at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Overview
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires that any data collection conducted or sponsored by the federal government complies with its regulations. All Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) programs that engage with the general public to collect information must submit PRA requests to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in order to proceed with data collection activities. The Information Collection Review Office (ICRO) of the CDC facilitates the process of reviewing and submitting PRA requests to the OMB on behalf of all CDC programs.
CDC Paperwork Reduction Act Compliance
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) is a law that requires federal agencies to:
Seek public comment on proposed information collections.
Obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before collecting information from the public.
The PRA grants authority to OMB to review and approve federally conducted and sponsored data collections involving ten or more respondents. The law and its implementing regulation (5 CFR 1320
) reduce the burden placed upon non-Federal entities (the public). The PRA prevents Federal agencies and their programs from collecting unnecessary information.
Goals of the PRA are to:
Minimize the burden on the public when collecting information, especially by using technology.
Maximize the practical use of the information collected.
Ensure that an Information Collection does not duplicate already existing information.
Maximize the cooperation amongst federal program areas and agencies.
Promote openness and accountability in the collection and use of information.
Improve integrity, quality, security, and utility of information to all users within and outside the federal government.
Improve federal responsibility and accountability.
To access federal agencies' and their internal program offices' active and inactive information collection clearance packages, go to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
. This is a United States government website produced by the OMB and the General Services Administration.

About Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
KEY POINTS
Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria.
Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria: soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF), and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF).
Overview
Relapsing fever is an illness characterized by one or more episodes of fever, headache, and muscle pain that lasts several days and is separated by roughly a week of feeling well. Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria, which are distantly related to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria:
Soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), also known as tickborne relapsing fever
Hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF)
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)
There are differences in how severe the infection can be and where a person may be exposed.

About the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
AT A GLANCE
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is one of several different systems CDC uses to monitor the safety of vaccines.
VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event).
Anyone — patients, family members, healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers — can submit a report to VAERS. Healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers are legally required to report certain events after vaccination.
A report to VAERS does not mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event.
If it looks as though a vaccine might be associated with a health problem, CDC and FDA investigate further and take action if needed.
Overview
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS
) is the nation's early warning system that monitors the safety of FDA-approved vaccines and vaccines authorized for use for public health emergencies. The system accepts and analyzes reports of possible adverse events after vaccination and is co-managed by CDC and FDA. The number of reports submitted varies each year. VAERS accepts reports regardless of seriousness or how likely the vaccine may have caused the adverse event.
A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event.
A VAERS report alone does not indicate whether a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event. Only scientists and public health professionals can make this determination after thorough investigation.
Most VAERS reports involve mild side effects such as fever, arm soreness or mild irritability. Federal law defines reports of certain adverse events as serious reports. These include reports of the following after vaccination:
Permanent disability.
Hospitalization.
Extension of an existing hospitalization.
Life-threatening illness.
Congenital (present at birth) deformity/birth defect.
Death.
VAERS staff attempt to collect additional information from healthcare providers and clinicians about adverse events described in serious reports. While serious adverse events can happen after vaccination, they are rarely caused by the vaccine.
Report an adverse event to VAERS
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS. Learn more about which adverse events to report and how to report them.
VAERS: Access and Use
What data VAERS collects
The type of vaccine received.
The date of vaccination.
When the adverse event began.
Current illnesses and medications.
Medical history.
Past history of adverse events following vaccination.
Demographic information.
How data collection works
VAERS is a passive surveillance system, meaning it relies on people sending in reports of their experiences after vaccination.
Keep Reading:
About CDC’s Vaccine Safety Monitoring Program
How the data are used
CDC and FDA use VAERS reports to:
Assess the safety of newly licensed or authorized vaccines.
Detect new, unusual or rare adverse events that happen after vaccination.
Monitor increases in known side effects, like arm soreness where a shot was given.
Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of health problems related to vaccines.
Identify and address possible reporting clusters.
Recognize safe-use problems and administration errors.
Watch for unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports.
Serve as a vaccine safety monitoring system in public health emergencies.
Add to and improve scientific literature
and understanding of vaccine safety monitoring.
Signals
Patterns or an unusually high number of adverse events reported for a vaccine are called ""signals."" If they detect a signal, scientists may conduct further studies in VSD or CISA to find out if it represents an actual risk. CDC and FDA investigate further and act if needed.
Strengths and limitations of VAERS data
When evaluating VAERS data, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations.
Strengths
VAERS accepts reports from anyone. This also allows VAERS to act as an early warning system to detect rare adverse events.
VAERS collects information about the vaccine, the person vaccinated, and the adverse event. Scientists obtain follow-up information on serious reports.
All data from the initial VAERS report (without identifying patient information) are available to the public.
Limitations
VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected. Instead, someone who had or is aware of an adverse event following vaccination must file a report.
Anyone can submit VAERS reports. Some reports can lack details or contain errors. After investigation, scientists find that most events reported to VAERS are not associated with vaccination.
The number of reports submitted to VAERS can change in response to media attention and public awareness. Such changes in reporting can complicate interpretation of VAERS data.
When more people hear about vaccine side effects, they may report any health outcomes they experience after vaccination.
This increase in reporting can complicate detecting patterns of adverse events that should be further assessed in a strong, reliable data analysis system.
Such increased reporting can also create the misconception that vaccines are dangerous, leading to fear and hesitation about vaccination.
It is usually not possible to use VAERS data to calculate how often an adverse event occurs in a population.
The number of people receiving a vaccine is usually not available (a notable exception was during the COVID-19 public health emergency when the number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered was reliably reported to CDC).
VAERS data alone cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event. Establishing a causal relationship requires rigorous scientific assessment and consideration of multiple factors beyond just VAERS reports alone.
A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event
VAERS accepts all reports of adverse events following vaccination without judging whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. Some VAERS reports might represent true vaccine reactions or side effects; others might be coincidental adverse events not related to vaccination.
This limitation has caused confusion about the publicly available data.

Reptiles and Amphibians
WHAT TO KNOW
Reptiles and amphibians are more likely than other pets to carry harmful germs that can make people sick.
Children under 5, adults over 65, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick from these germs.
Wash your hands after handling reptiles and amphibians, their food, or items in their environment.
Provide your pet reptile or amphibian with routine veterinary care to keep it healthy and prevent the spread of disease.
Overview
Millions of households in the United States own at least one reptile (like a turtle, lizard, or snake) or amphibian (like a frog, salamander, or caecilian). Reptiles have dry and scaly skin, whereas amphibians have smooth, slimy skin.
Reptiles and amphibians are more likely than other pets to carry germs that make people sick, even when they appear clean and healthy.
The most common germ carried by reptiles and amphibians is Salmonella. Reptiles and amphibians often carry Salmonella bacteria in their digestive tracts. Even healthy reptiles and amphibians can carry the bacteria. People can get sick from Salmonella bacteria through contact with reptiles, amphibians, or their environments, including water from their tanks or aquariums.
If you decide that a reptile or amphibian is the right pet for you, it's important to learn how to properly care for your pet. Appropriate husbandry and veterinary care can help keep you both safe from illness.
Diseases
Below is a list of diseases that reptiles and amphibians can spread.
Aeromonas infection
Mycobacterium marinum infection
Salmonella infection
How to stay healthy around reptiles and amphibians
Consider another pet if there are young children, older adults, or people with weakened immune systems in the household.
Before buying or adopting a pet reptile or amphibian, make sure it is the right type of pet for your family. Some reptiles can live for a very long time. Reptiles and amphibians require special care and are more likely than other pets to carry germs that make people sick, like Salmonella, even when they appear clean and healthy.
Not recommended for certain people
Because they are more likely to carry certain germs, reptiles and amphibians aren't recommended for households with young children, people with weakened immune systems, or adults 65 and older.
Wash your hands
Wash your hands with soap and running water:
After feeding your pet or handling pet food
After handling your pet's poop or equipment (for example, cages, aquariums, rocks, enrichment, tank decorations, tank water)
After cleaning your pet's tank or aquarium
Before eating and drinking
Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol.
Safely care for your pet reptile or amphibian
Children's safety
Children younger than 5 years old should not handle or touch reptiles or amphibians or their environments because they are at a higher risk for serious illness and hospitalization caused by Salmonella infection.
Don't cross-contaminate
You don't have to touch a reptile or amphibian to get sick from the germs they carry. Reptile food, tank water, equipment, and habitats can be contaminated with Salmonella and other germs.
Keep reptiles, amphibians, and their equipment out of the kitchen or anywhere that food is prepared, stored, served, or eaten. Don't allow reptiles or amphibians to roam freely throughout a home or living area. Supervise your pet when outside of its habitat to prevent accidents and contamination.
Safely feed your pet reptile or amphibian
Feeder rodents for snakes and other reptiles can carry germs like Salmonella.
Keep pet food separate
Use a designated container for storing and thawing frozen food for your pet. Keep the pet food away from human food.
Wash your hands and clean the container immediately after feeding pet reptiles and amphibians.
Using feeder rodents
Frozen or live rodents used for pet food, also called feeder rodents, can carry germs that can make people sick. This can happen even if the rodent looks healthy and clean.
Certain people shouldn't handle feeder rodents
Children under 5 years old, adults 65 and older, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems shouldn't handle feeder rodents because they are at higher risk for diseases rodents can carry.
Freezing feeder rodents does not kill germs. Always wash your hands after handling live or frozen rodents or touching anything they came in contact with.
Clean and disinfect all surfaces and supplies that come in contact with rodents. Rodents can contaminate surfaces where they are thawed or anything they touch. You can get sick by touching contaminated surfaces; you don't have to touch the rodents to get sick from their germs.
Keep rodents and their supplies out of the kitchen or other areas where food is prepared, served, or consumed. Never use the kitchen sink or food preparation areas to thaw frozen rodents or to clean live rodent habitats. Do not thaw frozen rodents in the microwave.
Clean rodent supplies outside your home when possible. If you clean rodent supplies indoors, use a laundry sink or bathtub, and thoroughly clean and disinfect the area right after. Use frozen rodents when possible to reduce the risk of injury to your or your pet. Never feed your pets wild rodents.
Safely clean your pet reptile or amphibian's habitat
Animal supplies such as tanks, feeders, water containers, and other pet equipment or materials should be cleaned outside the home if possible. Never use food preparation areas to clean reptile and amphibian habitats or equipment.
If you clean supplies outside, do so away from gardens or other sources of food or drinking water.
If cleaning outside the home isn't possible, clean supplies in a laundry sink or bathtub. If you clean supplies in the bathtub, thoroughly clean and disinfect the area before use by others. Pour tank water and other wastewater from reptile and amphibian habitats down the toilet instead of sinks or drains.

Prevent reptile scratches and bites
Not all reptiles and amphibians have teeth, but even those who don't (like most turtles) can still have painful bites. Bites from reptiles and amphibians can be dangerous because they can spread germs and sometimes other toxic substances, depending on the type of animal. Bites and scratches can be serious injuries and sometimes can become infected.
How to prevent bites and scratches
Don't kiss or hold reptiles or amphibians close to your face, as this might frighten them and increase your chances of being bitten.
Make sure the animal sees you before you pick it up. If an animal is surprised, they might bite out of fear.
Feed your reptile with tongs. Don't give them food from your hand. Handle your pet often so they become used to being held. If you only handle your pet to feed them, they might learn to associate a hand with food.
What to do if you are bitten or scratched
Wash bites and scratches immediately
Pet bites and scratches can spread germs, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious. If you are bitten or scratched by a reptile or amphibian, you should wash the wounds with warm soapy water immediately.
Seek medical attention, especially if:
The animal appears sick or is acting unusual.
The wound or injury is serious (uncontrolled bleeding, unable to move, extreme pain, muscle or bone is showing, or the bite is over a joint).
The wound or site of injury becomes red, painful, warm, or swollen. (Especially if the person bitten is younger than 5 years old, 65 or older, a pregnant woman, or has a weakened immune system.)
It has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot.
If the animal becomes sick or dies after biting a person, let your veterinarian know within a few days to a week. They can determine whether the animal might have had germs that could spread to people.
Venomous reptiles and amphibians
Do not keep venomous animals as pets.
CDC does not recommend keeping venomous animals as pets or in household settings.
Venoms are a defense that some reptiles and amphibians use to protect themselves from any potential dangers or harm in their environment. Some venomous animals, like poison dart frogs and coral snakes, can be identified by their bright colors and markings. However, some venomous animals are harder to identify. Some animals can transmit venoms through bites or through contact with their skin or saliva.
You should always consider the unpredictable nature of venomous animals and be aware that treating a bite from a venomous animal is difficult. Venoms are very toxic and can have severe and life-threatening effects. Antivenoms can treat some bites, but these medications can cost hundreds of dollars and might not be available at some hospitals. In addition, antivenom sometimes can cause allergic reactions that can be just as dangerous as the venom itself.
If you keep or work with venomous animals, make a list of all the hospitals in your area that stock antivenoms for those types of animals. Include hospital phone numbers and addresses. Put this list somewhere easy to find, like on your refrigerator or near the animal's habitat.
What to do if you are bitten by a venomous animal or get venom on your skin
Seek medical attention for venomous bites
Seek medical attention immediately for a bite from a venemous animal, even if the wound doesn't seem serious.
Call your healthcare provider as soon as possible so that they can prepare the appropriate antivenom. Be as clear as possible about the type, colors, and markings of the animal. Correct identification of the animal helps healthcare providers to provide the appropriate treatment.
Don't handle or trap the animal, because venom can be dangerous even after the animal has died. Remain as calm and still as possible until you can be treated by a healthcare provider.
Apply first aid:
Lay or sit down. If possible, position the bite so that it is below the heart.
Remove rings and jewelry before swelling begins.
Wash the wound with warm water and soap.
Cover the wound with a clean, dry bandage.
Go to the hospital as soon as possible. Fast treatment will reduce damage caused by venom and improve chances for recovery.
Don't drive. Snake bites can cause dizziness and fainting.
How to keep pet reptiles and amphibians healthy
Keeping pet reptiles and amphibians healthy can help keep you healthy too.
Before choosing a pet reptile or amphibian
Think about the people in your household. Some people are at higher risk for serious illness from germs reptiles and amphibians can carry, especially children younger than 5 years old, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems.
Do your research
Research and learn how to properly care for reptiles and amphibians before buying or adopting. Ask a veterinarian about the proper food, care, environment, and other needs of the specific pet you are interested in adopting.
Find an exotic veterinarian in your area
Reptiles and amphibians require specialized care. Most veterinarians do not treat reptiles or amphibians.
Check local laws
Check state, local, and property laws before selecting or purchasing a reptile or amphibian. Some reptiles or amphibians might not be allowed in apartments or rental homes. Do not keep venomous animals as pets or in household settings.
Did You Know?
The sale of turtles less than 4 inches has been banned in the United States since 1975. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made this decision because small turtles pose a higher risk of spreading disease, especially to children. Each year, the ban prevents an estimated 100,000 cases of Salmonella infection among children.
How to choose a pet reptile or amphibian
Remember that some reptiles and amphibians can live for a very long time. Make sure you are prepared for the commitment of caring for the animal during its long lifespan.
Choose healthy animals
Ask about the animal's diet and if it has been eating (if an animal isn't eating, there may be a health problem).
Don't keep wild animals as pets
Don't catch wild reptiles or amphibians and keep them as pets.
Buy turtles with shells longer than 4 inches
Federal law bans the sale of small turtles
, although some are illegally sold in souvenir shops and at roadside stands. Buy only from a trusted pet store and avoid roadside or temporary vendors.
How to house your reptile or amphibian
Provide your reptile or amphibian with a safe, warm, and comfortable environment that has the appropriate humidity levels and lighting. Reptiles and amphibians often have very specific requirements for their habitats. Talk with your veterinarian about your pet's needs.
Don't allow pet reptiles and amphibians to interact with or eat wild animals.
Monitor your pet's health
Exotic veterinarians can help keep pet reptiles and amphinians healthy.
Learn about proper management of your reptile or amphibian's health, including temperature and humidity requirements. Taking good care of the animal can decrease your pet's stress and the chances of it getting sick.
To keep your pet as healthy as possible, visit an exotic veterinarian experienced in reptile and amphibian care (herpetology) for regular check-ups. A veterinarian will not be able to prevent your reptile or amphibian from shedding Salmonella because these bacteria are normally found in healthy reptiles and amphibians.
If your pet becomes sick or dies soon after purchase, take it to the veterinarian and inform the pet store or breeder about the pet's illness or death. Consider waiting before purchasing or adopting another pet. Do not use the habitat until it has been properly cleaned and disinfected. These practices will help prevent the spread of disease.
What to do if you no longer want your pet reptile or amphibian
Don't release unwanted pets
Releasing pets isn't good for the animal or the environment. Most reptiles and amphibians released outdoors will die, and some can threaten natural wildlife
Find a new home for your pet:
Contact a nearby pet store for advice on rehoming your pet.
Contact a local pet rescue group to see if they can help rehome your pet.
Contact a local aquarium or zoo to see if they would accept your pet.

Human Subjects Protection
KEY POINTS
All research involving human subjects by CDC complies with the HHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects.
All such research must be approved by an institutional review board (IRB) prior to the start of the research.
Staff are required to maintain competency in research ethics and human research regulations.
Overview
All research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must comply with the Health and Human Services (HHS) Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (45 CFR Part 46
). This includes research conducted by CDC employees or supported by CDC through funding or provision of other tangible support. It also applies whether research is conducted inside or outside the United States.
Unless exempt, all such research must be approved by an institutional review board (IRB) prior to the start of the research. CDC's Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) facilitates the work of the IRB. It also provides consultations and training for CDC staff engaged in research involving human subjects. Clinical investigations that involve the use of drugs, biologics, or devices—whether unlicensed or used outside standard medical practice—are subject to IRB review and approval under 21 CFR Part 50
and 21 CFR Part 56
.
CDC Institutional Review Boards
CDC has two Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), properly constituted in accordance with 45 CFR Part 46
and 21 CFR Part 56
:
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IRB
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—NIOSH IRB
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IRB
Based in Atlanta, Georgia, this IRB convenes monthly on the third Thursday of each month. Some adjustments may be made for federal holidays. The CDC IRB may convene on an ad hoc basis for urgent reviews. This IRB reviews protocols from all CDC Centers, Institutes, and Offices (with exception of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health).
Centers for Disease Control & Prevention—NIOSH IRB
Based in Cincinnati Ohio, this IRB reviews human research conducted or supported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. This board meets on the second Tuesday of each month and as needed for emergency situations.
Service on an IRB
IRB members serve for three years. They may serve longer at the discretion of the CDC Human Research Protection Office, the IRB chair, and the member. Service on an IRB is considered vital to the continuing research efforts of the agency and volunteers are always welcome.
The IRB chairs and vice-chairs collectively form the IRB Executive Committee. This committee meets as needed to discuss matters of common interest to the IRBs, to refine policy and practice, and to strive for reasonable consistency across the IRBs.
Training requirements for conducting research on human subjects at CDC
CDC investigators and scientific administrative staff involved in the conduct or oversight of federally funded human research are required to maintain competency in research ethics and human research regulations. This is done by completing specific trainings via the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)
prior to initiating activities. It is also required at certain intervals afterwards.
For partners working under an existing Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), CDC will continue to verify the active FWA.
Individual investigators not working under separate FWA (i.e., collaborating with CDC under an Individual Investigator Agreement) will be asked to submit proof of having completed human subject research training within the past 3 years.

FEBRUARY 26, 2024
Research to Practice (r2p)
KEY POINTS
Research to Practice (r2p) focuses on the collaboration between NIOSH and partners to utilize and adapt NIOSH knowledge, technologies, and interventions for practical application.
The aim of r2p is to move research into practice in order to reduce and eliminate work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities.
Purpose
The main objective is to move research into practice, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application to ensure worker safety and health.
Get involved
NIOSH welcomes partnerships with governmental and non-governmental organizations including non-profit organizations, trade associations, academic and research institutions, and the private sector. In order to accomplish our mission, NIOSH seeks to establish formal and informal relationships with partners in order to maximize resources and ensure a safer and healthier workforce.
Pathways to partnership with NIOSH include:
Establishing a formal partnership agreement with NIOSH, such as a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, Data Use Agreement, or Memorandum of Understanding.
Participating on a National Occupational Research Agenda Sector Council.
Exploring NIOSH Extramural Research and Training Programs to learn more about various funding opportunities.
Discovering opportunities to unite private sector partners with NIOSH scientists to achieve common goals and ""do more, faster"" through the CDC Foundation
(a private, nonprofit, 501(c)(3) public charity).
Visiting Federal Register Notices for opportunities to provide comment on NIOSH rules, proposed rules, and information collection activities, attend meetings, and explore potential partnership opportunities.
Core Elements
There are six core elements for effective r2p:
Partnerships
A NIOSH partner is any individual, group, or organization (e.g., government, labor, academic, business, trade or professional association) whose collaborative efforts enhance NIOSH-funded research activities and help promote the movement of research into practice. Partners play key roles in activities such as:
identifying occupational safety and health issues and needs;
designing, planning, and conducting studies;
translating and communicating research findings into policy, technology, practice, and/or information products;
engaging interested, affected, or relevant parties;
implementing and assessing recommended work policies or practices; and
evaluating or demonstrating the impact of these efforts on improving the safety and health of workers.
Intramural Science
Intramural science is conducted by researchers employed by NIOSH. For more information on NIOSH's intramural programs, visit NIOSH Programs.
Extramural Science
Extramural science is generated through funding provided by NIOSH to outside organizations. For more information on NIOSH extramural programs, visit NIOSH Extramural Research and Training Programs.
Technology Transfer
Technology transfer is the process by which knowledge, technologies, and interventions are transferred from the Government to the public or private sector.
Communication
Communication is the process through which science is translated into information products, then shared and promoted with an intended audience. NIOSH uses communication tools and strategies to create clear messages, select appropriate formats, and determine effective channels through which the information may be delivered and understood by an intended audience.
Evaluation
Evaluation is an assessment of how well an r2p effort meets measurable objectives, milestones, or goals. Results of evaluations may inform the planning of an effort (i.e., feasibility, or need), process (i.e., tracking), progress toward outcomes and objectives, or provide a final measure of impact.
Resources
r2p Tools
NIOSH uses the r2p roadmap guidance document and worksheet
developed by The Center for Construction Research and Training to plan our dissemination and help facilitate the use, adoption, and adaptation of NIOSH knowledge, interventions, and technologies.
r2p Technology Solutions
Through our research efforts, NIOSH produces new scientific knowledge and practical solutions vital to reducing risks of injury and death in occupational settings. NIOSH then seeks the assistance of commercial partners to move these solutions into practical application and adoption. This is accomplished by granting licenses to parties wishing to further develop, use or commercialize these inventions.
Licensing a NIOSH Technology
Use or commercialization of these NIOSH technologies may require a license. A license is a legal agreement which defines the terms and conditions under which a third party may make, use or sell the invention.
The licensing of NIOSH technologies is handled by the National Institutes of Health's Office of Technology Transfer (NIH OTT). NIH OTT has provided a helpful flowchart of the licensing process
to explain the steps to securing a license for a NIOSH technology. Find NIOSH technologies available for licensing on the Explore NIH Technologies
site and search for ""NIOSH.""

RESPIRATORS
Español (Spanish) Print
Overview
Respirators protect users in two basic ways. The first is by removing contaminants from the air. Respirators of this type include particulate respirators, which filter out airborne particles; and “gas masks” which filter out chemicals and gases. Other respirators protect by supplying clean respirable air from another source. Respirators that fall into this category include airline respirators, which use compressed air from a remote source; and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), which include their own air supply.
Respirators should only be used when engineering control systems are not feasible or insufficient. Engineering control systems, such as adequate ventilation or scrubbing of contaminants, are the preferred control methods for reducing worker exposures.
NIOSH approves respirators in accordance with 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 84 (42 CFR 84) and provides guidance for their use in occupational settings. Respirator standards are developed in collaboration with various government and industry partners.

Respiratory Infections in the Workplace
KEY POINTS
Respiratory infections in workers can have a major impact on business operations.
Employers can use these resources to prevent and respond to respiratory infections in the workplace.
Overview
Each workplace is unique. A worker's risk for job-related exposure to respiratory infections can vary widely depending on the nature of their job.
Types
Examples of respiratory infections that can impact the workplace include coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and seasonal influenza (flu).
Prevention
Ventilation and Engineering Controls
Improving building ventilation can reduce risk of exposure to respiratory viruses and reduce the spread of respiratory infections.
Another strategy involves using Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI). UVGI uses ultraviolet energy to kill viral, bacterial, and fungal organisms.
Clean and Disinfect
Regularly cleaning surfaces helps prevent the spread of germs that can cause respiratory infections.
Keep the Workplace Healthy From COVID-19
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration provides guidance for employers
on mitigating and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.
Keep the Workplace Healthy During Flu Season
Employers can make a plan to keep the workplace healthy and prepare for flu season:
Develop policies that encourage sick workers to stay home when sick
Follow these 10 steps to prevent the spread of flu in the workplace
Promote the flu vaccine in the workplace
What CDC is doing
NIOSH actively works to minimize work-related risks of catching respiratory infections in the workplace through research, service, and partnerships. NIOSH works closely with other parts of the CDC, other federal agencies, and non-governmental partners.
CDC has resources to help monitor respiratory infection activity and spread. Employers can use these resources to make informed decisions about workplace safety and health measures like remote work and masking.

About RSV
WHAT TO KNOW
RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms.
Infants and older adults are more likely to develop severe RSV and need hospitalization.
CDC recommends immunizations to protect infants, some young children, and older adults.
What is RSV?
Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that infects the nose, throat, and lungs. RSV symptoms make it difficult to distinguish it from the common cold or other respiratory viruses (like the flu or COVID-19). RSV spreads in the fall and winter along with other respiratory viruses. It usually peaks in December and January.

How RSV Spreads
RSV can be dangerous for infants and older adults
RSV does not usually cause severe illness in healthy adults and children. However, some people with RSV infection, especially older adults and infants younger than 6 months of age, can become very sick and may need to be hospitalized.
RSV can also cause more severe illness such as bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lungs) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs). It is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age.
In the most severe cases, a person may require:
Additional oxygen,
IV fluids if they can't drink enough to stay hydrated, or
Intubation (have a breathing tube inserted through the mouth and down to the airway) with mechanical ventilation (a machine to help a person breathe).
In most of these cases, hospitalization lasts only a few days.
Learn more about people at high risk for severe RSV infection.

MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Fast facts
CDC estimates that each year roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) gets sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases.1
Foodborne illnesses cost the U.S. about $17.6 billion per year.2
Many of these illnesses occur as part of a foodborne illness outbreak; 841 foodborne illness outbreaks were reported to CDC in 2017.3
More than half of all foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States are associated with restaurants, delis, banquet facilities, schools, and other institutions.3
What CDC is doing
Practice-based research
The Environmental Health Specialists Network (EHS-Net) connects environmental health specialists, epidemiologists, and lab professionals from CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Department of Agriculture, and 8 state and local health departments.
Since 2000, CDC has funded state and local health departments for more than 20 retail food safety studies, leading to 52 publications.
Prevention tools and guidance
CDC provides the National Environmental Assessment Reporting System (NEARS) for health departments.
Our free training helps food safety staff address environmental causes of foodborne illnesses and outbreaks.
Plain language summaries guide outbreak prevention strategies.
What you can do
Restaurant managers are in a key position to influence the policies and practices in their restaurant that affect food safety.
Explore findings on specific practices and foods linked to outbreaks.

Rhabdomyolysis and Work
KEY POINTS
Rhabdomyolysis (rhabdo) is a serious medical condition that can lead to permanent disability or death.
Workplace risk factors include heat exposure and physical exertion.
Rhabdo symptoms can look similar to heat-related illnesses and dehydration; only testing can tell the difference.
Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent death and disability.
What it is
Rhabdo is a serious medical condition. Rhabdo occurs when damaged muscle tissue releases its proteins and electrolytes into the blood. These substances can damage your organs and lead to:
Death
Dangerous heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
Seizures
Kidney damage or kidney failure
Permanent disability
Nausea and vomiting
Rhabdo can occur from any type of muscle damage. This includes heat, overuse, accidents, or other causes.
Signs and symptoms
If you develop rhabdo, you might have 1 or more of these symptoms:
Muscle cramps, aches, or pains that are more severe than expected
Dark urine (tea- or cola-colored)
Feeling weak or tired, unable to complete tasks or finish a workout you were able to do previously
You can’t tell by symptoms alone if you have rhabdo. The only way to know for sure is to see a healthcare provider. They can order blood tests for creatine kinase (CK), a marker for muscle damage. You need repeated tests to see if CK levels are rising or falling.
Seek medical care
If you have any of these symptoms at any time, do not ignore them. Seek medical treatment right away. Earlier diagnosis means an earlier start to treatment and a greater chance of recovery without permanent health effects.

Signs and Symptoms of Rhabdomyolsis (Rhabdo)
Risk factors
Farm workers perform physical labor in the heat, increasing their risk for rhabdo.
Anyone can get rhabdo, but some workers are at a higher risk than others.
Workplace risk factors include:
Heat exposure
Physical exertion
Direct trauma (e.g., crush injury from a fall)
Other risk factors
There are also non-work-related factors that can increase your risk. This includes some medical conditions, behaviors, and use of certain medications.
Keep Reading:
Risk Factors for Rhabdomyolysis (Rhabdo)
Prevention
Workers and employers can take action to lower workers' risk of rhabdo. Some important steps include:
Preventing workers from getting overheated
Encouraging workers to seek medical care when experiencing symptoms
Keep Reading:
Reducing Risk for Rhabdomyolysis (Rhabdo)
Treatment and recovery
Early treatment can prevent serious medical problems. It also increases your chances of a quick recovery and return to work without any lasting negative health effects.
Workers with symptoms of rhabdo should:
Stop activity
Drink more liquids (water preferred)
Seek immediate care at the nearest medical facility
If heat stroke is suspected, follow these first aid steps.

Treatment of Rhabdomyolysis (Rhabdo)
Myths and misconceptions
Even athletes can get rhabdo.
It’s a common misconception that only unfit or out of shape people get rhabdo. People in great shape, such as firefighters, marathon runners, and professional athletes, get rhabdo. It can happen to anyone and even after activities you have done in the past without a problem.
People also falsely believe dehydration causes rhabdo. Dehydration doesn't cause rhabdo but it can make it worse. Dehydration impairs the body's ability to get rid of the proteins and electrolytes in the blood stream released from damaged muscle. These proteins and electrolytes cause organ damage.
Related conditions
Heat-related illnesses
Other heat-related conditions, like heat exhaustion and heat cramps, can cause similar symptoms. Learn more about heat-related illnesses.
Compartment syndrome
Compartment syndrome is a painful condition also caused by muscle damage. Some muscles are grouped together inside a thin, fibrous sheath or covering. Swelling from muscle damage inside the sheath can cause pressure to build, because the sheath cannot stretch very far. This swelling and pressure can prevent blood flow to muscles, causing the muscle to die.
Compartment syndrome is not common, but it is important to get immediate medical treatment. Delayed treatment can cause permanent disability.

Rheumatoid Arthritis
KEY POINTS
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints.
There’s no cure for RA, but you can manage and treat it with medicines and lifestyle changes.
It’s best to diagnose and treat RA early to avoid joint damage and worsening symptoms and complications.
Doctors diagnose RA through a physical exam, X-rays, lab tests, and a review of a patient’s health history.
Overview
RA is an autoimmune disease
RA is a disease in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.
This causes damage to the joints in the hands, wrists, and knees.
The damage from RA can result in:
Long-lasting (chronic) pain.
Swelling.
Balance issues.
Deformed joints.
RA can also affect the lungs, heart, and eyes.
RA limits physical activities and social connections
RA can limit enjoyment of some life activities.
People with RA may experience social isolation.
RA can make it hard to do physically demanding or fast-paced work.
RA can be managed
There is no cure for RA. But it can be managed.
You can practice self-care and take medicines to reduce pain and limit complications.
Signs and symptoms
RA symptoms include:
Pain, aching, or stiffness in more than one joint.
Tenderness, redness, warmth, and swelling in joints.
Weight loss.
Fever.
Fatigue or tiredness.
Weakness.
Flares and remission
People with RA may experience:
Flares—when symptoms suddenly appear or get worse.
Remission—when symptoms get better or go away.
Things that increase risk for RA
The causes of RA are not known.
Smoking
Smoking can increase your risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis and can make arthritis worse.
Smoking can also make it harder to be physically active, which is important for managing arthritis symptoms.
If you want to quit smoking, help is available.
Visit How to Quit, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW, or text QUITNOW to 333888.A
Factors linked to RA
Factors that may be linked to RA:
Age—RA risk increases as people get older. It’s highest among adults 50 to 59.1
Sex—Women are two to three times more likely to have RA.1 Women who haven’t given birth may have a greater risk of RA.
Early life exposures—Children whose parents smoked were more likely to develop RA as adults.2 Also, adults from lower-income families may have a higher risk of RA.3
Family history—Certain genes can increase the risk of RA, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II gene.
Diagnosis
Finding out if you have RA
Doctors can diagnose RA by doing:
A physical exam.
X-rays.
Lab tests.
A review of your health history.
Expert Care
It's important to get diagnosed with RA as soon as possible so you can start treatment.
Rheumatologists—doctors who specialize in arthritis care—should diagnose and treat RA.
Early treatment helps prevent symptoms from getting worse and doing damage to your joints.
Seek diagnosis as soon as possible if you’re experiencing RA symptoms.
Treatment options
A group of drugs, called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat RA. These may help to:
Slow RA from getting worse.
Control joint swelling.
Prevent joints from becoming deformed.
If your RA does not respond to initial treatment, your doctor may give you medicines called biologics, which are a type of DMARD. These:
Block specific parts of the immune system that cause RA symptoms.
Can reduce the progression of joint damage from RA.
Self-care for RA
Besides medicines, there are things you can do on your own to manage RA.
Self-care tips
Be physically active.
Keep a heathy weight.
Avoid injuries to joints or doing activities that have repetitive motions like repeated knee bending.
Stop smoking.
Learn about other self-care strategies for arthritis, including RA, that can help you feel better.

Ricin
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Ricin is a natural poison that can harm the body.
Signs and symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was breathed in, swallowed, or injected.
If you were exposed, get medical care.
Background
Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the ricin that comes out can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans.
Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet. It can also be dissolved in water or weak acid.
It is stable under normal conditions. However, it will not work if temperatures are over 80 degrees centigrade (176 degrees Fahrenheit).
Where it is found
Castor beans are processed throughout the world to make castor oil. Ricin is part of the waste ""mash"" produced when castor oil is made.
Ricin has been used in experiments in medicine to kill cancer cells.
In the 1940s, the U.S. military experimented with using ricin as a possible warfare agent. In some reports, ricin has possibly been used as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq. It is also that ricin has been used more recently by terrorist organizations.
How it works
Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die.
Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.
Signs and symptoms
The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on how much ricin someone was exposed to and how they were exposed. Many organs may be affected in severe cases.
Death could happen within 36 to 72, depending on how much ricin someone was exposed to and how they were exposed.
Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was breathed in, swallowed, or injected.
Breathing in ricin
First symptoms of ricin poisoning by breathing in may occur as early as 4 to 8 hours. It may occur as late as 24 hours after exposure.
Within a few hours, the following may occur:
Difficulty breathing
Fever
Cough
Nausea
Tightness in the chest
Eventually symptoms may worsen into:
Heavy sweating
Fluid buildup in the lungs making it harder to breathe
Diagnosed by x-ray or stethoscope
Blue skin
Low blood pressure
Respiratory failure
All of these symptoms can lead to death.
If you know you have been exposed to ricin and have trouble breathing, seek medical care.
Swallowing ricin
If ricin is swallowed, first symptoms usually occur in less than 10 hours.
Symptoms include:
Vomiting
Diarrhea (maybe bloody)
Severe dehydration
Low blood pressure
Other signs or symptoms may include:
Seizures
Blood in the urine
Liver, spleen, and kidney failure
These symptoms can lead to death.
Skin and eye exposure
Ricin is unlikely to be absorbed (taken in) through normal skin. Touching ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain on the skin and the eyes.
Exposure
Ricin poisoning is not contagious and accidental exposure is not likely. However, castor beans and ricin can be swallowed.
You can also be exposed if you come into contact with someone who has ricin on their body or clothes.
Ricin could be made into a partially purified material or into a terrorist or warfare agent. If that happens, ricin could be used to expose people through the air, food, or water.
In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who lived in London, died from ricin poisoning. He was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella was made to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin.
What to do if you are exposed
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
Get fresh air by leaving the area where the ricin is.
If ricin was released outside, move away from the area. If ricin was released indoors, get out of the building.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. If you swallowed ricin, do not force vomiting or drink fluids. Call 911 and tell them what happened.
Take off your clothes
Take off the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any ricin from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Response by authorities
A clue of ricin poisoning is when lots of people who were close to each other have the same symptoms.
If authorities think ricin may have been spread, they will perform environmental tests. These tests will find ricin in powders or materials that are let out into the environment. People who live in these areas may also be looked at for signs of ricin poisoning.
The CDC can temporarily test samples for urinary ricinine. Urinary ricinine is an alkaloid (natural compounds with nitrogen) in the castor bean plant. Only urinary ricinine testing is available at CDC or the Laboratory Response Network (LRN).
Treatment
No cure exists for ricin. The most important thing to do is avoid ricin exposure in the first place. If you cannot avoid exposure, get the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible.
Patients showing symptoms of ricin poisoning are treated by giving patients supportive medical care to lower the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care depend on how the person was exposed (breathing in, swallowing, or skin or eye exposure).
Care could include the following:
Helping people breathe
Giving intravenous fluids (giving fluids to the vein using a needle)
Giving medications to treat issues like seizure and low blood pressure
Giving activated charcoal (if the ricin was very recently swallowed)
Washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated

About Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
KEY POINTS
The most common symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) are a fever, headache, and rash.
RMSF is spread through the bite of an infected tick.
There is no vaccine to prevent RMSF.
RMSF can be deadly if not treated early with doxycycline.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
What it is
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a bacterial disease spread through the bite of an infected tick.
Signs and symptoms
Early signs and symptoms are not specific to RMSF (including fever and headache). However, the disease can rapidly progress to a serious and life-threatening illness.
Signs and symptoms can include:
Fever
Headache
Rash
Nausea or vomiting
Stomach pain
Muscle pain
Lack of appetite
When to seek medical care
If you become ill after having been bitten by a tick, having been in the woods, or in areas with high brush where ticks commonly live, see your healthcare provider.
Rash
A rash is a common sign of RMSF. It usually develops 2 to 4 days after fever begins. The look of the rash can vary widely over the course of illness. Some rashes can look like red splotches and some look like pinpoint dots. RMSF is challenging to diagnose since the rash, a common symptom, often appears late in the illness.
Late-stage rash in a patient with Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Long-term health problems
RMSF does not result in chronic or persistent infections. Some patients who recover from severe RMSF may be left with permanent damage, such as:
Amputation of arms, legs, fingers, or toes (from blood vessel damage)
Hearing loss
Mental Disability
Any permanent damage is caused by the acute illness and does not result from a chronic infection.
How it spreads
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a serious tickborne illness which can be deadly if not treated early. It is spread by several species of ticks in the United States, including:
American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis)
Brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) - parts of southwestern United States and Mexico
Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni)
RMSF cases occur throughout the United States.
View Larger
Estimated geographic distribution of American dog ticks.
View Larger
Estimated geographic distribution of Rocky Mountain wood ticks.
Prevention
There is no vaccine to prevent RMSF. Prevent illness by preventing tick bites on yourself, on your pets, and in your yard.
Tick exposure can occur year-round, but ticks are most active during warmer months (April-September). Know which ticks are most common in your area.
Testing and diagnosis
Your healthcare provider may order certain blood tests to look for evidence of RMSF. The results of these tests can take weeks. If your healthcare provider thinks your illness might be RMSF, they should recommend antibiotic treatment before test results are available.
Treatment and recovery
RMSF can be life-threatening. Early treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline can prevent death and severe illness. It is approved for adults and children of all ages.
Doxycycline is the recommended antibiotic treatment for RMSF.

About Other Spotted Fever Rickettsioses
KEY POINTS
Spotted fever rickettsioses are a group of diseases caused by closely related bacteria. These bacteria are spread to people through the bite of infected ticks and mites.
Symptoms can include a dark scab (eschar) at the site of the tick or mite bite, fever, headache, rash, and muscle aches.
Your healthcare provider may order certain blood tests to look for evidence of spotted fever infection.
Doxycycline is the recommended treatment for people of all ages.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Spotted fever rickettsioses (spotted fevers) are a group of diseases caused by closely related bacteria, spotted fever group Rickettsia. These bacteria are spread to people through the bite of infected mites and ticks. The most serious reported spotted fever in the United States is Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF).
Other causes of spotted fevers in the United States include:
Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, caused by Rickettsia parkeri
Pacific Coast tick fever, caused by Rickettsia rickettsii subspecies californica (formerly Rickettsia species 364D)
Rickettsialpox, caused by Rickettsia akari
Spotted fevers can range from mild to life-threatening. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for all spotted fever infections.
Signs and symptoms
The first sign of many spotted fevers (including Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, or rickettsialpox) is generally a dark scab at the site of tick or mite bite, known as an eschar. Eschars usually develop a few days to a week following the bite of an infected tick or mite.
Several days after an eschar develops, patients can develop other signs and symptoms.
Signs and symptoms can include:
Fever
Headache
Rash
Muscle aches
R. parkeri rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, and rickettsialpox are less severe than RMSF; however, it can be difficult to distinguish between RMSF and other spotted fevers, especially during early stages of these diseases. Ticks are typically found in grassy or wooded environments. See your healthcare provider if you become ill after having been bitten by a tick, or having spent time in areas where ticks may live. Rickettsialpox is spread by mites carried by the common house mouse. Be sure to mention any time spent in areas where mice may be found.
Causes
Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, caused by infection with R. parkeri, is spread by the Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum, which is distributed primarily in the southeastern United States, with focal populations in the northeastern, midwestern, and southwestern United States.
Pacific Coast tick fever is caused by the bacteria R. rickettsii subsp. californica (previously referred to as Rickettsia sp. 364D). Pacific Coast tick fever is spread by the bite of infected Pacific Coast ticks, Dermacentor occidentalis, which can be found along the western coastline in California, Oregon, and Washington.
Rickettsialpox is caused by R. akari. Unlike the other spotted fevers described here, R. akari is spread through the bite of infected mouse mites (Liponyssoides sanguineus). Cases occur occasionally throughout the United States, but are most often reported out of the northeastern United States, particularly New York City.
Prevention
Prevent spotted fever illness by preventing tick bites, preventing ticks on your pets, and preventing ticks in your yard. Prevent rickettsialpox by controlling rodent infestations.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Tick Bites
Testing and diagnosis
The signs and symptoms of spotted fevers are similar to those of many other diseases. See your healthcare provider if you develop the signs and symptoms of spotted fevers.
Be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you become ill and have recently been bitten by a tick, exposed to mice, or have spent time in areas where ticks or mice may be found.
Your healthcare provider may order certain blood tests to look for evidence of spotted fever infection.
The results of these tests can take weeks. If your healthcare provider thinks your illness might be a spotted fever, they should recommend antibiotic treatment before results are available.
Treatment
Some spotted fevers are not life-threatening and can resolve over time, even without treatment. For others, especially RMSF, early treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline can be lifesaving.
Doxycycline is the recommended antibiotic treatment for all spotted fevers, including RMSF in adults and children of all ages.

About Rift Valley Fever (RVF)
KEY POINTS
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes that can spread to livestock or people.
People get RVF through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals.
People also get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes.
Most people with RVF get better without treatment.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is caused by Rift Valley fever virus, which is found in most of sub-Saharan Africa, especially eastern and southern Africa. Rift Valley fever virus is carried by mosquitoes and can spread to people and animals, including cows, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels.
RVF most often affects domestic animals including livestock and causes severe illness, pregnancy loss and death in the animals. RVF creates a major economic burden in affected areas as raising animals for milk and meat is an important source of income for many people.
People usually get RVF through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals in areas where the virus is found. This can happen when people perform the following activities without taking steps to prevent infection:
Slaughtering or butchering
Caring for sick animals
Providing veterinary procedures like helping an animal give birth
Eating or drinking raw or undercooked animal products
People can get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes and, rarely, other biting insects. Laboratory workers have also gotten accidentally infected during testing for Rift Valley fever virus.
There has never been a case reported of RVF virus spreading from person to person.
RVF outbreaks typically occur during years of unusually heavy rainfall and flooding.
Excessive rainfall allows more mosquito eggs to hatch.
The virus spreads from the female mosquitoes to the eggs.
As more mosquitoes hatch, the potential for the virus to spread directly to animals and people increases.
In addition, RVF outbreaks in animals leads to people handling infected animals more often, increasing their risk of getting sick.

Healthcare providers:
Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like Rift Valley fever, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms begin about two to six days after exposure to the RVF virus. People with RVF often have either no symptoms or a mild illness that includes fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness. Typically, patients recover without treatment within two to seven days after symptoms start.
Eight to 10 percent of people with RVF develop severe symptoms, including:
Eye disease with blurred and decreased vision, or sores on the eyes. These sores disappear after 10-12 weeks for most patients. Around half of all patients with sores on the center of the retina will have permanent vision loss.
Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) in less than 1 percent of RVF patients, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizure. Encephalitis can cause severe and long-lasting health problems.
Bleeding occurs in less than 1 percent of all RVF patients. Symptoms of bleeding may begin with yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), vomiting blood, bloody stool, or bleeding from gums, skin, nose, and injection sites. Fifty percent of patients with bleeding die.
Overall, about 1 percent of people infected with RVF die of the disease.
Exposure risks
People at risk for becoming infected with RVF virus include:
Spending time in rural areas and sleeping outdoors at night in areas where outbreaks regularly occur. This can increase opportunities for being bitten by infected mosquitoes.
Working with potentially infected animals in areas where the virus regularly occurs. This includes animal herdsmen, slaughterhouse workers, and animal caretakers like veterinarians.
Traveling to areas where RVF regularly occurs or during an outbreak.

Map of countries where Rift Valley fever has been reported
Prevention
People living in or visiting areas with RVF can prevent infection with these steps:
Avoid contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of potentially infected animals. People working with animals in areas where RVF virus is found regularly should wear gloves, boots, long sleeves, and a face shield to protect themselves.
Handle, eat, and drink animal products safely. All animal products, including meat, milk, and blood, should be thoroughly cooked before eating or drinking them.
Protect yourself against mosquitoes and other bloodsucking insects. Use insect repellents and bed nets, and wear long sleeved shirts and long pants to cover exposed skin.
Protect Yourself from Mosquitoes
Learn more about what you can do to keep mosquitoes from biting you.
Preventing Mosquito Bites
No RVF vaccines are currently available for people. There are a few types of vaccines available for use in animals.
Testing and diagnosis
Diagnosing RVF, especially early in the illness, can be difficult because symptoms can be mild and similar to many other illnesses. RVF virus can be confirmed with laboratory testing.
For healthcare providers
Clinicians in the United States who may be concerned a patient could have RVF should contact their local or state, tribal, local, or territorial health department immediately.
Treatment and recovery
Most RVF cases are mild, and people tend to get better without treatment within two to seven days. Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with symptoms of mild illness like fever and body aches. People who are very sick may need to go to the hospital, where they'll receive supportive care like fluids and pain medication.

FUNGAL DISEASES
APRIL 24, 2024
Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections Basics
KEY POINTS
Ringworm (dermatophytosis) is a common fungal infection of hair, skin, or nails.
Athlete's foot, jock itch, and most fungal nail infections are forms of ringworm.
On the skin, it usually causes an itchy, red, ring-shaped rash.
Nail infections (onychomycosis) may cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily.
What it is
Ringworm (tinea) is a common fungal infection of the hair (tinea capitis), skin, or nails (onychomycosis). It gets its name from the ring-shaped, itchy, red rash it causes on skin.
Ringworm is more common on certain parts of the body. Ringworm on the feet (tinea pedis) is often referred to as athlete's foot. Ringworm on the groin (tinea cruris) is often called jock itch.
Ringworm is a common type of fungal nail infection (onychomycosis). It can cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily. Although infections are much more common in toenails, fingernails can get infected. Fungal nail infections can lead to infections on the skin of the foot.

Clinical Overview of Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections
Health Care Providers:
Emerging Severe and Antimicrobial-Resistant Ringworm
Causes
Ringworm is caused by fungi (not a worm). The scientific names for the most common fungi that cause ringworm are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton.
Ringworm is very common and can be spread by:
Skin-to-skin contact with people or animals with the infection
Shared objects (e.g., towels, bed sheets)
Shared surfaces (e.g., locker room floors)
Risk factors include:
Use of public showers or locker rooms without protective footwear
Participating in contact sports like wrestling
Wearing tight shoes and socks
Excessive sweating
Close contact with animals
Protect Yourself from Ringworm
Help protect yourself and others from ringworm.
MAY 9, 2024
Anyone can get ringworm, but people who have weakened immune systems may be especially at risk for infection. They may also have problems fighting off a ringworm infection.
Keep Reading:
What Causes Ringworm
Testing
If you have a rash, nail infection, or symptoms of ringworm, go to a healthcare provider for testing. You may go to your primary care provider, dermatologist, or podiatrist. Symptoms of ringworm are similar to symptoms for other skin or nail conditions. Testing can help make sure you get the right treatment.
Ask your healthcare provider to test for ringworm infections.
Healthcare providers may take a small skin scraping or nail sample for testing.
Treatment
The treatment for ringworm depends on its location on the body and how serious the infection is. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription (over-the-counter) antifungal medications. However, other forms of ringworm need treatment with prescription antifungal medication.
Keep Reading:
Treatment of Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections
Do not use steroid creams for rashes that could be ringworm.
Steroids (or corticosteroids) are in many over-the-counter creams for rashes. Steroid creams can make ringworm infections worse. If you have a ringworm or a rash that could be ringworm, do not use creams containing steroids.

Riot Control Agents
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that cause irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Several different compounds are riot control agents:
Chloroacetophenone (CN)
Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS)
Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant
Bromobenzylcyanide (CA)
Dibenzoxazepine (CR)
Combinations of various agents.
Where it is found
Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray).
CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks.
How it works
Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure.
The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off.
Signs and symptoms
The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors).
People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure:
Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness
Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling
Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling
Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath
Skin: burns, rash
Other: nausea and vomiting
Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as:
Blindness
Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess
Immediate death due to severe chemical burns to the throat and lungs
Respiratory failure possibly resulting in death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to riot control agents.
Exposure
Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles.
If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in.
What to do if you are exposed
Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents.
If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground.
If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe.
Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes.
Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages.
No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents.
Long-term health effects
Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following:
Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness)
Eye scarring
Cataracts
Breathing problems, such as asthma
These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors.
If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

PARASITES 
MAY 13, 2024
About Filarial Worms
KEY POINTS
Filarial worms are a type of microscopic parasitic worm.
They mainly spread through insect bites.
Symptoms from filarial worm infections can be minor (e.g., itching or swelling) but may be severe (e.g., blindness).
There are antiparasitic drugs that can treat filarial worm infections.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Filarial worms are a family of parasites that are found in tropical regions. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Once they infect a person, they can cause diseases that attack different parts of the body.
Symptoms
Symptoms of filarial worm infections range from itching and swelling to disfigurement and blindness. However, many people infected with filarial worms will have no symptoms.
Diseases and common symptoms caused by filarial worms include
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, can cause itchy skin and skin changes and damage the eyes and may lead to blindness.
Lymphatic filariasis, sometimes called elephantiasis, can cause severe swelling of body parts, particularly legs, arms, genital area, and other parts of the body.
Loiasis, also known as Loa loa or African eye worm, can cause itchy, non-painful swellings on limbs or worms that move across the eye.
Mansonellosis, which can cause fever, fatigue, and joint and abdominal (belly) pain.
Causes and spread
Filarial worm diseases affect millions of people a year in Africa, South America, the Pacific islands, and Asia. They spread mostly through the bites of insects like blackflies, mosquitoes, or midges.
Tiny immature worms, known as larvae, will enter a human body when the insect bites into the skin. Once inside a person, they spread throughout the body, grow, and reproduce. When an insect bites an infected person, the insect can ingest the new larvae and eventually infect another person.
Prevention
In most cases, the best way to prevent most filarial worm infections is to avoid insect bites. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using insect repellent on exposed skin, and sleeping under mosquito nets will help prevent insects from biting you.
Treatment
Medications known as antiparasitic drugs can treat new filarial worm infections. In people with advanced disease-causing chronic swelling, surgery or lymphedema care may be needed.
Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are currently the target of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. These campaigns deliver safe and inexpensive drugs aimed at reducing or eliminating transmission of these infections. For some, filaria MDA will reduce symptoms as well. For others, other treatments are needed for symptoms.

Robotics in the Workplace: An Overview
KEY POINTS
U.S. companies are using robots more often to perform dangerous or repetitive tasks.
The increasing number and types of robots in the workplace has created a knowledge gap related to human-robot interaction.
NIOSH is providing scientific leadership to address the safety and health of workers who use, wear, or work near robots.
Why it's important
Robots have existed in the workplace for many years, but their numbers and capabilities are quickly growing. Robots can enhance worker safety, health, and well-being. However, there are also safety concerns.
Facts
A NIOSH analysis identified 41 robot-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1992-2017.1
The number of industrial robots in U.S. factories grew by 10% in 2022.2
The number of service robots sold for professional use in the U.S. rose to 158,000 units in 2022—a 48% increase.2
Types of robots
Robots are machines or automated technologies that can perform a series of actions. They can do everything from drive cars to perform surgery. You can find various types of robots in today's workplaces:
Traditional industrial robots work in robotic cells and cages away from human workers.
Professional service robots assist workers in completing tasks. These include:
Remotely controlled or autonomous vehicles
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones
Collaborative robots directly interact with people. These include:
Wearable robotics or powered exoskeletons
Co-existing or mobile robots that can navigate through the workplace
Impacts
Robots can improve worker safety, health, and well-being by doing work in high-risk environments. For example:
Robots could inspect offshore oil rigs while people remain safely on shore.
Drones might allow farmers to apply pesticide without exposure to chemicals.
Service robots may help healthcare workers safely lift patients without the risk of musculoskeletal injuries.
A fleet of self-driving vehicles could reduce motor vehicle crashes among delivery workers.
Risks
Robots can improve safety and productivity in the workplace. However, there are also potential hazards associated with using robot systems. Hazards to workers might include:
Struck-by or caught-between hazards
Crushing and trapping
Slipping, tripping, and falling hazards
Electrical hazards3
Emerging risks
The increasing use of robots that work in close proximity to people brings new risks to the workplace. These emerging risks may not yet be fully understood. Robots working near people could:
Injure workers through unexpected contact
Distract workers from hazards
Cause workers mental stress
Distrust of the robot's capabilities
Concern about job loss
Safety and health professionals must continually ensure that the use of robots does not create additional hazards or risks to workers. This is important as technology advances and workplace applications change.
What's being done
NIOSH's Center for Occupational Robotics Research addresses the safety, health, and well-being of workers who use, wear, or work near robots.

About Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
KEY POINTS
The most common symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) are a fever, headache, and rash.
RMSF is spread through the bite of an infected tick.
There is no vaccine to prevent RMSF.
RMSF can be deadly if not treated early with doxycycline.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
What it is
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a bacterial disease spread through the bite of an infected tick.
Signs and symptoms
Early signs and symptoms are not specific to RMSF (including fever and headache). However, the disease can rapidly progress to a serious and life-threatening illness.
Signs and symptoms can include:
Fever
Headache
Rash
Nausea or vomiting
Stomach pain
Muscle pain
Lack of appetite
When to seek medical care
If you become ill after having been bitten by a tick, having been in the woods, or in areas with high brush where ticks commonly live, see your healthcare provider.
Rash
A rash is a common sign of RMSF. It usually develops 2 to 4 days after fever begins. The look of the rash can vary widely over the course of illness. Some rashes can look like red splotches and some look like pinpoint dots. RMSF is challenging to diagnose since the rash, a common symptom, often appears late in the illness.
Late-stage rash in a patient with Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Long-term health problems
RMSF does not result in chronic or persistent infections. Some patients who recover from severe RMSF may be left with permanent damage, such as:
Amputation of arms, legs, fingers, or toes (from blood vessel damage)
Hearing loss
Mental Disability
Any permanent damage is caused by the acute illness and does not result from a chronic infection.
How it spreads
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a serious tickborne illness which can be deadly if not treated early. It is spread by several species of ticks in the United States, including:
American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis)
Brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) - parts of southwestern United States and Mexico
Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni)
RMSF cases occur throughout the United States.
View Larger
Estimated geographic distribution of American dog ticks.
View Larger
Estimated geographic distribution of Rocky Mountain wood ticks.
Prevention
There is no vaccine to prevent RMSF. Prevent illness by preventing tick bites on yourself, on your pets, and in your yard.
Tick exposure can occur year-round, but ticks are most active during warmer months (April-September). Know which ticks are most common in your area.
Testing and diagnosis
Your healthcare provider may order certain blood tests to look for evidence of RMSF. The results of these tests can take weeks. If your healthcare provider thinks your illness might be RMSF, they should recommend antibiotic treatment before test results are available.
Treatment and recovery
RMSF can be life-threatening. Early treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline can prevent death and severe illness. It is approved for adults and children of all ages.
Doxycycline is the recommended antibiotic treatment for RMSF.

Rat-bite Fever (RBF)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
JULY 9, 2024
About Rat Bite Fever (RBF)
KEY POINTS
Rat-bite fever (RBF) is an infectious disease people can get from contact with rodents.
Anyone can get RBF, but having pet rodents or working with rodents may increase your risk.
If you have RBF symptoms and had recent contact with rodents, see a healthcare provider immediately.
RBF must be treated quickly, or it can cause severe illness and possibly death.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Anyone can get RBF if they have contact with rodents infected with the bacteria that cause RBF. Certain groups of people are more at risk for this serious and sometimes deadly disease.
The rodents that carry RBF include rats, mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, and squirrels. The bacteria that cause RBF is part of the natural germs in these rodents' bodies. Rodents that are carrying the bacteria that cause RBF do not show signs of illness, so it's not possible to tell if a rodent carries the bacteria just by looking at it.
If you know you were bitten or scratched by a rodent, and you develop symptoms consistent with RBF, you should seek medical care immediately. The infection is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. Getting treatment with the right antibiotics is important to keep the disease from progressing.
Thankfully, RBF is rare in the United States. But you should know many of these rodents that can carry it are popular pets, which can put people at risk. People who work in pet stores or labs with rodents also could be at higher risk.
Symptoms
The early symptoms of RBF can be like the flu. If you were infected by contact with rodents in North America, symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, and muscle pain. About half of people will also have joint pain or swelling, and 3 in 4 will develop a rash.
Symptoms usually begin 3 to 10 days after your contact with rodents. They can appear up to 21 days after the contact. By that time, the bite or scratch should be healed. This might make it hard to remember you were bitten.
Within 2 to 4 days after the fever begins, a rash may appear on the hands and feet. This rash looks like flat, reddened areas with small bumps. One or more joints may then become swollen, red, or painful.
The bacteria that cause RBF in Asia can be different than the bacteria that causes RBF in North America. If you were infected by contact with rodents in Asia, your symptoms might be different. They can include fever, swelling around the bite if you have one, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. As with the type of RBF found in North America, getting early treatment is important to protecting your health.
Complications
Complications of RBF can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system.
Early treatment with antibiotics is important to try to prevent complications of RBF. These complications can include pockets of infected fluid in the body, like in your belly. The disease can also cause infections of many major organs, including the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, and nervous system. These complications are rare but can be very serious and even deadly.
How it spreads
RBF can spread to people through scratches, bites, or contact with a rodent's saliva or pee. It can also spread by having contact with contaminated materials (rat bedding, cages, etc.), kissing pet rats, or eating or drinking contaminated food or drinks. RBF transmission does not necessarily require contact with rodents.
If you have pet rodents or handle rodents as feed for snakes/reptiles, you can be at increased risk for RBF. Other at risk include people who work at pet stores or laboratories where they may have contact with rodents.
Although rare, some animals like dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits can be infected by contact with infected rodents and then pass the infection on to people. People usually start to show signs they are sick 3-10 days after exposure. RBF cannot spread between people.
Prevention
You can lower your risk for RBF by avoiding contact with rodents, places with rodent infestations, or other areas where rodents may be present.
Although RBF is rare, it is important to take precautions and practice good hygiene when handling or coming into contact with rodents or potentially contaminated materials.
If you have pet rodents, handle rodents as feed for reptiles, or work with rodents in a pet store or laboratory, protect yourself from RBF by following CDC's small mammal guidance.
Quick facts
Quick facts
If you think you might have RBF, you should see your doctor immediately
Treatment and recovery
If you develop signs or symptoms of RBF, immediately contact a healthcare provider. Make sure to tell your provider about your contact with rodents.
Antibiotics can cure the disease if treatment is started soon after you become sick. It is important that you follow your healthcare provider's instructions. Take all of the medicine prescribed to you, even if you start to feel better.
These courses of treatment are very effective but if for some reason your symptoms worsen, see your health care provider immediately.

About Ross River
KEY POINTS
Ross River virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito.
Symptoms can include swollen or painful joints, fever, rash, and fatigue.
There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat Ross River virus disease (Ross River).
You can reduce your risk by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites.
Overview
Ross River virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Rarely, Ross River virus has spread through blood transfusion or from mother to baby during pregnancy.
Most cases of Ross River occur in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Cases have also been identified previously in many south Pacific islands including Fiji, American Samoa, New Caledonia, and the Cook Islands.
Ross River virus belongs to a group of viruses called alphaviruses. Symptoms can include swollen or painful joints, fever, rash, and fatigue. Death from Ross River has never been reported.
There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat Ross River. Reduce your risk of infection from Ross River virus by preventing mosquito bites.

About Rotavirus
KEY POINTS
Rotavirus commonly causes severe watery diarrhea and vomiting in infants and young children.
Children may become dehydrated and need to be hospitalized and can even die.
Protect your child with rotavirus vaccine.
What it is
Rotavirus causes common symptoms like watery diarrhea and vomiting, especially in children. There is no specific medicine to treat rotavirus infection, but your doctor may recommend medicine to treat the symptoms.
Rotavirus vaccine is the best way to protect your child against rotavirus disease.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of rotavirus usually start about 2 days after a person is exposed to the virus. Vomiting and watery diarrhea can last 3 to 8 days.
Most common symptoms
Severe watery diarrhea
Vomiting
Fever
Stomach pain
Dehydration
Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite and dehydration (loss of body fluids). This can be especially dangerous for infants and young children. Symptoms of dehydration include:
Decreased urination
Dry mouth and throat
Feeling dizzy when standing up
Crying with few or no tears
Unusual sleepiness or fussiness
Who is at risk
Rotavirus disease is most common in infants and young children. However, older children and adults, including people with weakened immune systems, can also get sick from rotavirus. Adults who get rotavirus disease tend to have milder symptoms.
How it spreads
Rotavirus spreads easily among young children
Rotavirus commonly spreads in families, hospitals, and childcare centers. Infants and young children can spread rotavirus to family members and other people with whom they have close contact. Children are most likely to get rotavirus in the winter and spring (January through June).
People who are infected with rotavirus shed (pass) the virus in their stool (poop). This is how the virus gets into the environment and can infect other people.
You can get rotavirus if you get virus particles in your mouth by:
Putting your unwashed hands that are contaminated with poop into your mouth.
Touching contaminated objects or surfaces and then putting your fingers in your mouth.
Eating contaminated food.
When people are contagious
People shed (pass) rotavirus the most and are more likely to infect others when:
They have symptoms.
During the first 3 days after they recover.
People with rotavirus can also infect others before they have symptoms.
Prevention
Rotavirus vaccination is the best way to protect your child from rotavirus disease. Good hygiene like handwashing and cleanliness are important but not enough to control the spread of the disease.
Children, even those who are vaccinated, may get infected and sick from rotavirus more than once. That is because neither natural infection with rotavirus nor vaccination provides full protection from future infections. However, vaccinated children are less likely to get sick from rotavirus.

Rotavirus Vaccination
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific medicine to treat rotavirus infection, but your healthcare provider may recommend medicine to treat the symptoms. Antibiotics will not help because they fight bacteria, not viruses.
Keep Reading:
Facts About Antibiotic Use
Watch for dehydration
Since rotavirus disease can cause severe vomiting and diarrhea, it can lead to dehydration (loss of body fluids).
Drink plenty of liquids
The best way to protect against dehydration is to drink plenty of liquids. You can get oral rehydration solutions over the counter in U.S. food and drug stores. These are most helpful for mild dehydration.
Seek medical care for severe dehydration
Severe dehydration may require hospitalization for treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids that patients receive directly through their veins.
If you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, contact your doctor. Infants and young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses are most at risk of dehydration.

Rotavirus Vaccination
KEY POINTS
Two or more doses of rotavirus vaccine are recommended for children by doctors as the best way to protect against rotavirus.
Two types of rotavirus vaccines are available for infants in the United States; both are safe and effective.
Both brands of the rotavirus vaccine are given by mouth (drops).
Introduction
The best way to protect against rotavirus disease is to get the rotavirus vaccine. Children who are not vaccinated usually have more severe symptoms the first time they get rotavirus disease. Vaccinated children are less likely to get sick from rotavirus.
Available vaccines
There are two rotavirus vaccines licensed for use in infants in the United States. Both available rotavirus vaccines are given by putting drops in the infant's mouth. Your child's doctor can help you choose which rotavirus vaccine to use.
RotaTeq® (RV5)
Rotarix® (RV1)
Rotavirus vaccine can be safely given during the same doctor’s visit with DTaP vaccine; Hib vaccine; polio vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
Recommendations
Your baby should get either of the two available rotavirus vaccines.
RotaTeq® (RV5) is given as 3 doses.
2 months old: 1st dose
4 months old: 2nd dose
6 months old: 3rd dose
Rotarix® (RV1) given as 2 doses.
2 months old: 1st dose
4 months old: 2nd dose
When to vaccinate your child
Before your child turns 15 weeks old, they should get the first dose of either rotavirus vaccine. Before your child turns 8 months old, they should receive all doses of rotavirus vaccine.
Why getting vaccinated is important
Rotavirus spreads easily among infants and young children. Getting vaccinated with the rotavirus helps:
Protect your baby from rotavirus, a potentially serious disease.
Protect your baby from developing diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain caused by rotavirus.
Keep your child from missing school or childcare and you from missing work.
Who should get vaccinated
Most infants should get rotavirus vaccine to protect against rotavirus disease.
Who shouldn't get the vaccine
Some infants should not get rotavirus vaccine, or they should wait. Check with your healthcare provider if your child has:
A severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to an earlier dose of rotavirus vaccine.
A severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of rotavirus vaccine. Tell your doctor if your baby has any severe allergies that you know of, including a severe allergy to latex.
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a condition in which a child's immune system cannot fight infections.
A previous episode of a type of bowel blockage called intussusception.
A weakened immune system because of:
HIV/AIDS, or any other disease that affects the immune system
Treatment with drugs such as steroids
Cancer, or cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs
Infants who are moderately or severely ill should wait to get the vaccine until they recover. These include infants with moderate or severe diarrhea or vomiting. Babies who are mildly ill can get the vaccine.
The vaccine is safe and effective
Rotavirus vaccine is very safe and is effective at preventing rotavirus. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own.
Both rotavirus vaccines were tested in large clinical trials that involved thousands of infants.
About 9 out of 10 who get the vaccine will be protected from severe rotavirus disease.
About 7 out of 10 children will be protected from rotavirus disease of any severity.
Before a vaccine was available, many children who became ill with rotavirus were hospitalized. Now, 94% to 96% vaccinated children are protected from hospitalization.
Possible side effects
Most babies who get rotavirus vaccine have no problems. However, some babies can have side effects that are usually mild and go away on their own. These may include irritability and mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting after a dose of rotavirus vaccine.
Intussusception
Serious side effects are possible but very rare. There is a small risk in cases of intussusception within a week after the first or second dose of rotavirus vaccine. Intussusception is a rare type of bowel blockage when the bowel folds into itself like a telescope.
Before rotavirus vaccine was used in the United States, each year about 1,900 infants developed intussusception before 1 year of age. With prompt treatment at the hospital, almost all infants who develop intussusception fully recover. Some babies might need surgery. The risk of intussusception from rotavirus vaccine is about:
1 case in every 20,000 U.S. infants to
1 case in every 100,000 U.S. infants
When to call the doctor
Look for signs of stomach pain along with severe crying. Babies might pull their legs up to their chest, vomit several times, or have blood in the stool. If you think it's intussusception, call a doctor right away. If you can't reach your doctor, take your baby to a hospital. Tell them when your baby got the rotavirus vaccine.
Finding and paying for the vaccine
Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers.
Keep Reading:
Where to Find Vaccines
Vaccine costs
There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines:
Health insurance
Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children Program
Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines.

About Common Cold
KEY POINTS
Different respiratory viruses can cause a cold.
You can get a cold any time of year.
Colds usually last less than a week.
Overview
A cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (also called an upper respiratory infection or URI). Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.
Signs and symptoms
The signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:
Runny nose or nasal congestion
Cough
Sneezing
Sore throat
Headache
Mild body aches
Fever (usually low grade in older children and adults)
Complications
Complications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:
Mild to moderate:
Middle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)
Sinus infections
Potentially severe:
Asthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)
Bronchitis (infection of the large airways)
Pneumonia (infection of the lungs)
Worsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)
Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness. This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.
Causes and spread
Causes
More than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses (including EV-D68), and human metapneumovirus.
SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested, especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.
Spread
Different respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
You can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.
Tip
You can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others. Read CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance.

JULY 1, 2024
Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009
PURPOSE
Part G of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 outlines requirements for the notification of emergency response employees when exposed to a disease on the List of Potentially Life-Threatening Infectious Diseases.
NIOSH developed a list of potentially life-threatening infectious diseases and related guidelines.
Overview
Emergency response employeesA (EREs) are at risk of exposure to potentially life-threatening infectious diseasesB through contact with victims during emergencies. Part G of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 requires that medical facilities provide EREs with notification of when they may have been exposedC to potentially life-threatening infectious diseases while transporting or serving victims of an emergency. Knowing this information allows EREs the opportunity to seek timely medical care and to make informed decisions about addressing potential health issues arising from their exposures.
How the program works
NIOSH has developed a list of potentially life-threatening diseases, including emerging infectious diseases, to which EREs may be exposed while transporting or serving emergency victims taken to a medical facility. Along with the list, NIOSH has also developed guidelines describing circumstances in which EREs may be exposed to a listed disease and the manner in which a determination of an exposure shall be made by a medical facility.
Medical facilities that receive and treat the victims of an emergency or ascertain the cause of death are responsible for routinely notifying and responding to requests pertaining to any determinations that a victim of an emergency has a listed potentially life-threatening infectious disease, as described in the NIOSH guidelines.
When a medical facility determines that a victim of an emergency has a potentially life-threatening airborne or aerosolized infectious disease, the medical facility is responsible for initiating notification to the ERE who transported the victim.
If an ERE believes they have been exposed to any potentially life-threatening disease on the NIOSH list, and has transported, attended, treated, or assisted the victim pursuant to the emergency, the ERE may initiate a request for notification from the medical facility to which the victim of the emergency was transported.
Guidelines
NIOSH has established guidelines describing ways employees may be exposed to these diseases and the guidelines describing the manner in which medical facilities should make determinations about exposures.
Keep Reading:
Guidelines for Ryan White Act Part G
Notification Process
There are two pathways for notification. Medical facilities should initiate notification if an ERE may have been exposed to an airborne or aerosolized infectious disease on the list. EREs who believe they have been exposed to a disease on the list can request notification.
Keep Reading:
Notification Process
List of potentially life-threatening infectious diseases
Diseases often have multiple transmission pathways. However, for purposes of this classification, diseases routinely transmitted via the aerosol airborneD and aerosol dropletE routes are so classified, even if other routes, such as contact transmission, also occur. CDC will continue to monitor the scientific literature on these and other infectious diseases. If CDC determines that a newly emerged infectious disease fits criteria for inclusion in the List of Potentially Life-Threatening Infectious Diseases to Which Emergency Response Employees May Be Exposed required by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009, CDC will amend the list and add the disease.
List of Potentially Life-Threatening Infectious Diseases to Which Emergency Response Employees May Be Exposed
Routinely transmitted by contact or by body fluid exposures
Anthrax, cutaneous (Bacillus anthracis)
Hepatitis B (HBV)
Hepatitis C (HCV)
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
