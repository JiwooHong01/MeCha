About Cryptococcosis
KEY POINTS
Cryptococcosis is a serious fungal infection caused by breathing in fungal spores in the environment.
Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii cause most infections.
Most infections occur in people with weakened immune systems, particularly people with HIV/AIDS.
Cryptococcus usually infects the lung or brain (cryptococcal meningitis).
Treatment requires antifungal medications.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by breathing in spores from Cryptococcus, a fungus found in the environment. The infection can affect the different parts of the body but usually causes lung or brain infections (cryptococcal meningitis).
Different species are found in different parts of the world. Most people who are exposed to Cryptococcus do not get sick. Infections are most common among people with weakened immune systems, particularly among people who have HIV/AIDS.
Cryptococcosis can be deadly and requires treatment with antifungal medication. Screening can help detect and treat infection before symptoms start or become severe.
Signs and symptoms
Cryptococcosis symptoms depend on which part of the body is affected. Symptoms of lung infections can include cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever.
Symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis can include headache, neck pain, sensitivity to light and confusion, or altered behavior.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Cryptococcosis
Causes
Two species (types) of Cryptococcus cause most infections, Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) and Cryptococcus gattii (C. gatti). Causes and risk factors for cryptococcosis may depend on the species. (C. neoformans or C. gattii).
C. neoformans lives in the environment throughout the world. C. gattii lives in tropical and sub-tropical areas; but it has been found in cooler regions like British Columbia and parts of the U.S.
Most infections occur among people with weakened immune systems. especially among people with advanced HIV/AIDS. People who are healthy can get cryptococcosis but it is not common.
Testing and treatment
Healthcare providers review medical history, symptoms, physical examinations, and laboratory tests to diagnose a cryptococcal infection. Healthcare providers can take a sample of tissue or body fluid, like blood or sputum, to send for laboratory testing.
Healthcare providers perform physical examinations and laboratory tests to diagnose cryptococcosis.
People who have cryptococcal infection need to take prescription antifungal medication for at least 6 months, often longer.
What CDC is doing
CDC provides technical assistance for targeted screening programs. In targeted screening programs people living with HIV are tested for cryptococcosis before starting antiretroviral therapy (ART).
CDC supports programs in regions with a high prevalence of cryptococcosis, including Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and sub-Saharan Africa. CDC is also supporting many countries to improve laboratory capacity to identify Cryptococcus.

About Campylobacter infection
KEY POINTS
Campylobacter bacteria are a common cause of diarrheal illness. The illness is called campylobacteriosis.
People most commonly get Campylobacter infection by eating raw or undercooked poultry.
Eating other contaminated foods, drinking untreated water, and touching animals that carry Campylobacter can also cause infection.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Campylobacter are bacteria that can make people ill with diarrhea. The illness is called campylobacteriosis.
Campylobacter cause the most bacterial diarrheal illnesses in the United States. CDC estimates that 1.5 million people in the United States get ill from Campylobacter every year.
Fast facts
Many Campylobacter infections are not diagnosed or reported.
Most infections are not part of recognized outbreaks.
Infections are more common in summer than in winter.
People at risk
Anyone can get Campylobacter infection. But some groups of people are at increased risk for infection or serious illness. These groups include
Children younger than 5
Adults 65 and older
People with a weakened immune system
People who work with animals
International travelers
How it spreads
Campylobacter can spread from animals to people.
Campylobacter can live in the intestines, liver, and other organs of animals. Many chickens, cows, and other animals carry Campylobacter without becoming sick.
Campylobacter can spread from these animals to people.
People can get infected in many ways.
It takes very few Campylobacter to make someone sick. For example, a single drop of juice from raw chicken can contain enough Campylobacter to cause an infection.
Common ways people get infected include:
Eating raw or undercooked poultry or other foods, including seafood, meat, and produce
Preparing raw or lightly cooked foods, including salad and fruits, with knives or on cutting boards that were used with raw poultry, seafood, or meat
Touching animals or their food, water, poop, belongings (such as toys and bowls), or habitats (such as beds, cages, tanks, coops, stalls, and barns)
Drinking untreated water

Unusual Patterns of Cancer, the Environment, and Community Concerns
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
APRIL 12, 2024
About Unusual Patterns of Cancer
KEY POINTS
Given the frequency with which cancers are diagnosed, sometimes situations arise where an unusual number of cancers are diagnosed among people in a particular location.
Not all unusual patterns of cancer are cancer clusters.
Contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry if you think your community is experiencing more cancer than usual.
Overview
Cancer is a group of diseases in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. As a group, cancers are very common.
Given the frequency with which cancers are diagnosed, sometimes situations arise where an unusual number of cancers are diagnosed among people in a particular location. These unusual numbers may be from chance, or they may result from the following:
Different cancer screening practices
Different access to health care, which may reflect other social and economic factors
Genetic susceptibility to a particular cancer
Behavioral risks and social determinants of health
Occupational exposures
Environmental exposures
Many causes of cancer are unknown. However, some environmental exposures have been shown to be related to the development of cancer in specific organs. For example, if you are exposed to asbestos, you could develop mesothelioma.
Definitions
Some unusual patterns of cancer are considered a cancer cluster.
A cancer cluster is defined as a greater than expected number of the same or etiologically related cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a defined period of time. Etiology refers to causes and risk factors associated with the development of disease. For example, exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer.
The definition of a cancer cluster can be further explained as follows:
A greater than expected number
When the number of observed cases is greater than typically observed in a similar setting.
Of the same or etiologically related cancer cases
Cases are of the same type, are within a family of tumors (for example Ewing's family of tumors
) or have a known or suggested link to the same specific environmental or chemical exposures. It is possible to consider multiple cancer types when such a known exposure (for example, radiation or a specific chemical) is linked to more than one cancer type or when more than one contaminant or exposure type has been identified.
Within a group of people
The population in which the cancer cases are occurring is defined by its demographic factors (for example, race/ethnicity, age, and sex).
In a geographic area
The geographic area may be based upon pre-existing geopolitical boundaries (for example, census tract, county, or ZIP code/ZIP code tabulation area). It may be defined according to the nature and extent of potential exposures that may cross multiple or partial boundaries. For example, air pollution from a hazardous waste incinerator which may cross multiple counties or census tracts. These geographic boundaries are used to determine the number of cancer cases as they relate to the total population in this predefined area. It is possible to create or obscure a cluster inadvertently by modifying the area of interest.
Over a defined period of time
The time frame used to establish the beginning and end dates for analysis. The time period chosen for analysis will affect both the total cases observed and the calculation of the expected incidence of cancer in the population.
Keep in mind
Not every unusual pattern of cancer will meet the above definition of a cancer cluster. Unusual patterns of cancer that meet some of the criteria described above and also have plausible environmental concerns still warrant further evaluation or assessment by local or state health departments.
Reporting cancer concerns
If you suspect your community or workplace may be experiencing more cases of cancer than expected, or if you'd like information such as cancer statistics or trends in your area, contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or state/territory cancer registry. A state, tribal, local, or territorial health department provides the first response to reports of unusual patterns of cancer.
For information about cancer in the workplace, please see the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health website.
Examining unusual patterns of cancer
State, tribal, local, and territorial health departments, along with cancer registries, respond to questions about unusual patterns of cancer.
Usually, health departments start by gathering information about the unusual pattern of cancer, including the expected cancer rate, types of cancer, number of cases, and the age, sex, race, address, occupation, and age at diagnosis of the people with cancer.
CDC/ATSDR has created a decision-making tool that can be used by health departments for determining the need to further assess an unusual pattern of cancer. The tool contains a set of criteria that can be used to assess the cancer(s) of concern and/or related environmental risk factors. These criteria promote further assessment of unusual patterns of cancer.
Reducing your risk of developing cancer
In general, cancers have a variety of risk factors related to behavioral, lifestyle, occupational, and environmental risks.
For many cancers, you can reduce your risk of developing cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and sun exposure; increasing physical activity; maintaining a recommended body weight; and eating a healthy and nutritious diet. Taking advantage of cancer screening also will reduce your risk.
For more information about preventing cancer, visit the following websites
CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control
The National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute
American Cancer Society
What CDC is doing
The federal role in responding to unusual patterns of cancer is limited. As needed, state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments may request technical assistance in response to unusual patterns of cancer from CDC/ATSDR. CDC/ATSDR may provide technical recommendations and make referrals to the appropriate state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry.
ATSDR is directed by congressional mandate to perform specific functions concerning the effect on public health of hazardous substances in the environment.
These functions include the following:
Public health assessments of waste sites
Health consultations concerning specific hazardous substances
Health surveillance and registries
Response to emergency releases of hazardous substances
Applied research in support of public health assessments
Information development and dissemination
Education and training concerning hazardous substances
Contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or state/territory cancer registry for inquiries regarding unusual patterns of cancer being investigated in your community.
More information
For more information about cancer in the workplace, visit the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health website.
The Guidelines for Examining Unusual Patterns of Cancer and Environmental Concerns provide more information on how unusual patterns of cancer are investigated.

Canine influenza, also known as dog flu, is currently caused by an influenza A(H3N2) virus that spreads in dogs. Dog flu likely poses a low threat to people. Canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses are different from seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses that commonly spread among people.
To date, there is no evidence of spread of canine influenza viruses from dogs to people. There has not been a single reported case of human infection with a canine influenza virus anywhere in the world.
In 2016, CDC used the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool to evaluate the potential risk of canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses causing a pandemic and found it to be low.
Evolving viruses
Influenza viruses are constantly changing. It is possible that a canine influenza A virus could change to gain the ability to infect and spread easily between people. Humans have little immunity against new, non-human (novel) influenza A viruses. Infections in people with novel influenza A viruses are concerning when they occur. If these viruses acquire the ability to spread easily among people, it could result in a pandemic.
For this reason, the World Health Organization conducts global flu surveillance, which has led to detection of novel influenza A virus infections in humans. Surveillance focuses on novel influenza A viruses of animal origin (such as avian or swine influenza A viruses).
Signs of Illness in Dogs
The signs of this illness in dogs include:
cough,
runny nose,
fever,
lethary,
eye discharge, and
reduced appetite.
However, not all dogs will show signs of illness. The severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and sometimes death.
Most dogs recover from dog flu within 2 to 3 weeks. However, some dogs may develop secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to more severe illness and pneumonia. Anyone who has concerns about their pet's health, or whose pet is showing signs of dog flu, should contact their veterinarian.
Testing is available to confirm canine influenza A(H3N2) virus infection in dogs. Your veterinarian can tell you if testing is appropriate.
Understanding risk
H3N2 canine influenza viruses are not endemic in dogs in the United States but multiple, localized outbreaks with regional die-outs continue to occur, seeded by repeated re-introductions from Asia. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016
and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore.
If evidence emerges that canine influenza viruses can infect people with the potential for sustained human-to-human spread, CDC has a plan in place. CDC will execute its existing authorities to limit the introduction and/or spread of that pandemic virus into or within the United States.
CDC regulations require that dogs be healthy to enter the United States. Dogs may be denied entry or further evaluated if they look like they could be sick with a communicable disease.
For dogs that appear sick or are dead upon arrival in the United States, CDC can require a veterinary examination or a necropsy (animal autopsy) at the owner's expense.
Multiple agencies may have regulatory authority over pets such as dogs and cats when entering the United States.
The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services has animal health requirements
related to bringing a pet dog to the United States from a foreign country.
How it spreads
Almost all dogs are susceptible to dog flu infection. Dog flu tends to spread among dogs housed in kennels and shelters.
Dog flu is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when infected dogs cough or sneeze. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces.
What CDC is doing about dog flu
Current CDC influenza virus regulations apply only to viruses with pandemic potential in people. However, CDC is doing a number of things to be prepared in the unlikely event that dog flu becomes a threat to humans or to animals other than dogs.
CDC continues to conduct year-round surveillance for seasonal and novel influenza A viruses. All human infections with novel influenza A viruses are fully investigated. Human infections with a novel influenza A virus of animal origin are reportable to CDC.
CDC has existing collaborative protocols with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services to work together in the event of outbreaks of novel influenza A viruses. These same protocols would be followed in the event of an outbreak of dog flu among people.
Third, CDC conducted a risk assessment on the pandemic potential of H3N2 canine influenza viruses using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool. The assessment found the pandemic risk posed by canine influenza viruses to be low.
Prevention
Vaccines to protect dogs against H3N2 dog flu are available in the United States. Your veterinarian can provide additional information about these vaccines and whether you should consider vaccinating your dog.
Dog owners whose dogs are coughing or showing other signs of respiratory disease should not expose their dog to other dogs or to cats. After exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease, people should clean and disinfect clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands.
Biology
Origins of H3N8 Canine Influenza
Canine influenza H3N8 viruses originated in horses and spread to dogs. H3N8 equine (horse) influenza (flu) viruses have been known to exist in horses for more than 40 years.
In 2004, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs were reported in the United States. An investigation showed that this respiratory illness was caused by equine influenza viruses.
Scientists believe that after jumping from horses to dogs, the virus adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among them. It spreads especially quickly among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. This is now considered a dog-specific (canine) H3N8 virus.
In September 2005, this virus was identified by experts as a ""newly emerging pathogen in the dog population"" in the United States. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016
and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore.
Origins of H3N2 Canine Influenza
Canine influenza H3N2 viruses originated in birds and spread to dogs
. The first H3N2 canine influenza viruses were reported in 2004. There has also been reported spread of H3N2 canine influenza viruses from dogs to cats.
H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in dogs in South Korea in 2007. These viruses have also been reported in dogs in China, Thailand, and Canada.
H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in the United States in April 2015. They have now been found in multiple U.S. states and regions. To date, the H3N2 canine viruses reported in the United States have been almost identical genetically to those previously reported in Asia.
Treatment
Treatment for dog flu largely consists of supportive care. In milder cases, supportive care may include medication to make your dog more comfortable and fluids to ensure that your dog remains well hydrated. This helps to keep the dog comfortable and hydrated while its body mounts an immune response.
Broad spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed by your veterinarian if they suspect a secondary bacterial infection.
Dog flu risk
A small percentage of dogs die from dog flu. Some dogs have asymptomatic infections (no signs of illness), while some have severe illness. Severe illness is characterized by the onset of pneumonia.

About Cannabis
KEY POINTS
Cannabis refers to the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant.
Cannabis can be used in a number of ways.
How cannabis affects a person depends on several factors.
What we know about cannabis
Cannabis, which can also be called marijuana, weed, pot, or bud, refers to the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant. The cannabis plant contains more than 100 compounds (or cannabinoids). These compounds include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is impairing or mind-altering, as well as other active compounds, such as cannabidiol (CBD). CBD – by itself - is not impairing, meaning it does not cause a ""high"".1
Types
Cannabis can be used in a number of ways.
The most common ways include:23
Smoked in joints (like a cigarette), in blunts (cigars or cigar wrappers that have been partly or completely refilled with cannabis) or in bongs (pipes or water pipes)
Vaped using electronic vaporizing devices (like vape pens) or other vaporizers
Mixed or infused into foods or drinks (called edibles) like cookies, cakes, or brownies, or tea, cola, or alcohol
Additionally, some people inhale the oil concentrates and other extracts from the cannabis plant—this is known as dabbing. THC oils and concentrates used in vaping and dabbing often involve using highly concentrated forms of THC and may contain additives or be contaminated with other substances that may be harmful.4
How cannabis affects a person depends on several factors, including:56
Concentration of THC used
Frequency of cannabis use
Use of cannabis with other substances (e.g., alcohol or other drugs), which could increase risk of harm
Mode of cannabis use (e.g., consuming edibles or products with high THC concentration can have delayed or unpredictable effects and increases the risk of overdose or poisoning)
Previous experience with cannabis or other drugs
Biology (e.g., genes, DNA)
Sex (e.g., women may experience more dizziness after using cannabis compared to men)
Cannabis as medicine
The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has approved one plant-based cannabis drug called Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of CBD. The prescription medication is approved for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome) as well as seizures associated with a rare genetic disorder called tuberous sclerosis complex.
The FDA has also approved two medicines (dronabinol [brand names: Marinol and Syndros] and nabilone [brand name: Cesamet]) that are made from a synthetic or lab-made chemical that mimics THC. These medicines are used to treat nausea in patients with cancer who are having chemotherapy treatment, and to increase appetite in individuals with AIDS who do not feel like eating (wasting syndrome).
These approved products are only available with a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. There are currently no other FDA-approved uses for cannabis or its derivatives.

About Capillariasis
KEY POINTS
Capillariasis is an infection caused by a parasite.
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
Medication is available to treat capillariasis. Without treatment, the infection can be deadly.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Capillariasis is a parasitic infection in humans caused by two species of nematodes (roundworms):
Capillaria hepatica (C. hepatica)
This infection can lead to hepatitis (liver disease).
C. hepatica is rare disease in humans (usually affects rodents and other wild animals). Despite this, there have been human cases reported on all continents except Australia.
Capillaria philippinesis (C. philippinesis)
This infection can lead to diarrhea and emaciation.
C. philippinesis is frequently found in the Philippines (especially the Luzon region) and Thailand. There are occasionally cases reported from other East and Southeast Asian countries. Rarely cases have been reported in Egypt, the Middle East, and Colombia.
Signs and symptoms
C. hepatica
People infected with a single C. hepatica worm or a few worms often have no signs or symptoms. Female worms lay eggs continuously and when infections with multiple worms occur, symptoms can be severe, and may include
Hepatitis
Anemia
Fever
Hypereosinophilia
Death
C. philippinensis
When people are first infected with C. philippinensis, they can have the following signs and symptoms:
General abdominal pain
Diarrhea
If the diseases are not treated, later on, people can develop severe disease and experience the following signs and symptoms:
Nausea
Vomiting
Weight loss
Death
How it spreads
C. hepatica
C. hepatica can be found in the livers of small rodents, monkeys, and prairie dogs, where it can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). When large carnivores eat these animals, they consume the capillarid eggs, which then pass through their stool (poop). When the carnivore poops in soil, the eggs become infective in about 30 days, which can then infect other animals and humans. Alternatively, when the infected rodents, monkeys, or prairie dogs die naturally and decompose, eggs from their livers are released into the soil.
If humans consume the eggs from the environment, either directly by eating soil (pica) or indirectly through contaminated food or water, the eggs move to the liver and mature to adult worms. C. hepatica can be transmitted human-to-human when eggs are deposited through human feces (poop) into the soil.
C. philippinensis
C. philippinensis is often found in small, freshwater fish. When humans consume raw or undercooked infected fish, larvae move to the intestine and mature to adult worms. Female worms deposit eggs in the intestine, which are then released through feces. When infected human feces reach freshwater, fish can get infected and the cycle continues. In some cases eggs may hatch within the human intestine, causing hyperinfection (a massive number of adult worms).
C. philippinensis is not transmitted from infected humans to other humans; transmission requires the intermediate freshwater fish host. However, adult C. philippinensis worms that grow within the intestine of infected humans can release eggs that hatch into larvae; this could cause hyperinfection in that human host. Left untreated, this can lead to severe disease.
Prevention
You can take steps to prevent both types of capillariasis:
Sanitation and hygiene precautions
Use sanitation facilities (toilets and latrines) that are out of reach from animals and will not let feces seep into the water or around food supplies.
Wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching or working with soil and before handling food.
Teach children the importance of handwashing.
Food precautions
Wash fruits and vegetables before eating them.
Do not eat raw or undercooked fish.
The FDA recommends the following for fish preparation or storage to kill parasites:
Cooking
Cook fish adequately (to an internal temperature of at least 145° F [~63° C]).
Freezing
At -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid, and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours.

Diagnosis
C. hepatica
Your healthcare provider can diagnose C. hepatica by performing a liver biopsy, needle biopsy, or after death at autopsy. Healthcare providers do not diagnose by analyzing stool samples.
C. philippinensis
Your healthcare provider can diagnose C. philippinensis by taking a biopsy of the small intestine tissue or analyzing stool samples.
Treatment and recovery
C. hepatica
Healthcare providers treat C. hepatica with thiabendazole and albendazole. However, C. hepatica is a rare infection and there is limited clinical experience. Healthcare providers have used steroids to help control liver inflammation.
C. philippinensis
Healthcare providers treat C. philippinensis with mebendazole (200mg twice a day for 20 days) or albendazole (400 mg a day for 10 days).

About Capnocytophaga
KEY POINTS
Capnocytophaga bacteria can cause a rare but potentially serious infection.
People usually get infected if they're bitten by a dog or cat.
People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk for infection and serious illness.
People bitten by a dog or cat should call a healthcare provider immediately.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Many kinds of bacteria (germs) are found in the mouths of dogs and cats. One common group of bacteria are called Capnocytophaga. These germs sometimes cause opportunistic infections, which means under the right conditions they can cause an infection, such as in a person with a weakened immune system.
Capnocytophaga bacteria are commonly found in the mouths of dogs and cats.
Capnocytophaga germs can make people sick if they're bitten or the dog or cat's saliva (spit) gets into an open wound or sore.
Most people who have contact with a dog or cat do not become sick. People with weakened immune systems who have difficulty fighting off infections are at greater risk of becoming sick if they're bitten.
Don't Get Bitten
Read more about how to prevent animal bites and what to do if you are bitten, regardless of your health status.
Dogs
Capnocytophaga infection can cause serious complications, including sepsis, heart attack, kidney failure, and gangrene. Some people may need to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated.
If you have been bitten by a dog or cat, wash the bite area right away with soap and water. Call your doctor or go to an urgent care clinic. Even if you don't feel sick, dog and cat bites can cause a Capnocytophaga infection and other diseases like Pasteurella, Bartonella (cat-scratch disease), or rabies.
Other types of Capnocytophaga infection
Other Capnocytophaga germs can also be found in human mouths and cause the people who have them to get sick. People who have weakened immune systems get this type of infection more often than healthy people.
People who get sick from the kinds of Capnocytophaga found in people’s mouths can get infections in their eyes, gums and mouth tissues, and respiratory tracts (nose, throat, lungs).
Capnocytophaga infection from dog or cat bites are much more common than illness from human mouths.
Signs and symptoms
If you have the following symptoms within 14 days of being bitten by a dog or cat, contact a healthcare provider immediately and tell them that you were recently bitten by an animal.
People who are infected with Capnocytophaga can have a range of signs and symptoms:
Blisters around the bite area
Redness, swelling, draining pus, or pain at the bite area
Fever
Diarrhea and/or stomach pain
Vomiting
Headache and/or confusion
Muscle or joint pain
In all Capnocytophaga infections the bacteria can enter the blood stream, which can lead to infection in various parts of the body (sepsis). Infection can also cause the following:
Inflammation of the lining of the heart (endocarditis)
Collections of pus, redness, and swelling in various body tissues (abscesses)
Inflammation of the eyes, face, lymph nodes, or brain membranes (meningitis)
Who's at risk
Most dog or cat bites do not lead to a Capnocytophaga infection or any illness. But you should take precautions if you have contact with animals, especially if you have a condition that puts you at higher risk of infection. These conditions include:
People with alcohol disorders
Not having a spleen (asplenic)
Having a weakened immune system (immunocompromise) from conditions like cancer, diabetes, or HIV, among others
Taking certain medicines that weaken your immune system, such as chemotherapy
If any of these conditions apply to you, speak with your healthcare providers about how to be safe around dogs and cats.
Prevention
Preventing Capnocytophaga infection starts with preventing bites and scratches from dogs and cats, especially if you have a condition that puts you at higher risk of getting sick.
Resource
There are many benefits to having pets like dogs and cats. CDC's Healthy Pets, Healthy People has tips for safer contact with pets.
Treatment
Call your healthcare provider immediately after being bitten by a dog or cat. They may want to start you on antibiotics if you have an increased risk of infection.
If you test positive for Capnocytophaga germs, you will need to start treatment as soon as possible to help prevent serious complications.
A Capnocytophaga infection can be treated with different kinds of antibiotics prescribed by a health care provider. You may need to take more than one antibiotic to help you get better.

Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Basics
AT A GLANCE
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death if inhaled.
Find quick facts about CO poisoning and what can be done to prevent it.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill.
Many household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and charcoal grills produce this poison gas.
Symptoms
The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as “flu-like.”
If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping or drunk can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms.
Risk factors
Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning. Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO.
Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 100,000 visit the emergency room, and more than 14,000 are hospitalized.
Reducing risk
CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps.
CO detectors
Replace your CO detector following manufacturer instructions
Install battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors near every sleeping area in your home.
Check CO detector batteries when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly.
Consider buying a detector with a digital readout. This type of detector can tell you the highest level of CO concentration in your home, in addition to sounding an alarm.
Replace your CO detector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years. Set a reminder on your smartphone or other device calendar when you purchase and install the detector.
Oil and gas furnaces and other household appliances
Have your heating system serviced annually
Have your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year.
Make sure your gas appliances are vented properly. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors, as shown below. This prevents CO from leaking if the joints or pipes aren't fitted tightly.
When you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a national testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories.
If you smell an odor from your gas refrigerator, have an expert service it. An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it could be leaking CO.
Never heat your house with a gas oven. Don't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented.
Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors
Chimneys, charcoal, and portable appliances
Have your chimney checked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris, which can cause CO to build up inside your home or cabin.
Never burn charcoal indoors. Burning charcoal - red, gray, black, or white - gives off CO.
Never use a portable gas camp stove indoors. Do not use portable flameless chemical heaters indoors.
Portable generators
Download
Operate your generator outdoors more than 20 feet from windows, doors, and vents to avoid CO poisoning
Never use a generator inside your home or garage, even if doors and windows are open.
Only use generators outside, more than 20 feet away from any windows, doors, and vents.
When using a generator, use a battery-powered or battery backup CO detector in your home.
If you have a had a poisoning incident related to any generator...
Let the Consumer Product Safety Commission know!
Report it now
Automobile
Have a mechanic check the exhaust system of your car or truck every year. A small leak in the exhaust system can lead to a buildup of CO inside the car.
Never run your car or truck inside a garage that is attached to a house, even with the garage door open. Always open the door to a detached garage to let in fresh air when you run a car or truck inside.
If you drive a car or SUV with a tailgate, when you open the tailgate open the vents or windows to make sure air is moving through. If only the tailgate is open, CO from the exhaust will be pulled into the car or SUV.

About Cardiomyopathy
KEY POINTS
Cardiomyopathy represents a collection of diverse conditions of the heart muscle.
Cardiomyopathy can be acquired—developed because of another disease, condition, or factor—or inherited.
What it is
Cardiomyopathy represents a collection of diverse conditions of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, symptoms, and treatments and can affect people of all ages and races.
When cardiomyopathy occurs, the normal muscle in the heart can thicken, stiffen, thin out, or fill with substances the body produces that do not belong in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump blood is reduced. This, in turn, can lead to irregular heartbeats, the backup of blood into the lungs or rest of the body, and heart failure.
Cardiomyopathy can be acquired—developed because of another disease, condition, or factor—or inherited. The cause isn't always known.
The main types of cardiomyopathy include the following:1234
Dilated: meaning that one of the pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart is enlarged. This is more common in males and is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in children. It can occur at any age and may or may not be inherited.
Hypertrophic: where the heart muscle is thickened. This often presents in childhood or early adulthood and can cause sudden death in adolescents and young adult athletes.1 It is often an inherited condition, and a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family members can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death.
Arrhythmogenic: where the disease causes irregular heartbeats or rhythms. This is often inherited and more common in males.
Restrictive: where heart muscle is stiff or scarred, or both. It can occur with amyloidosis (a rare disease that occurs when a protein called amyloid builds up in organs), or hemochromatosis (a disorder in which extra iron builds up in the body to harmful levels), and other conditions. This is the least common type.
Some people who have cardiomyopathy never have symptoms, while others may show signs as the disease progresses.
How common is cardiomyopathy?
Cardiomyopathy often goes undiagnosed,5 so the numbers can vary. As many as 1 of 500 adults may have this condition.67 Males and females of all ages and races can have cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is more common in Black people than in White people, and in males than in females.5
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to be the most common inherited or genetic heart disease. While this type of cardiomyopathy occurs at many ages, in children and young adults with this condition there may be no symptoms. Yet they are at high risk of sudden cardiac death.
Types
Pediatric cardiomyopathy
Cardiomyopathy can occur in children regardless of age, race, and sex. Pediatric cardiomyopathy can be inherited or acquired through a viral infection, and sometimes the cause is unknown. It is a frequent cause of sudden cardiac arrest in the young, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Treatment may include medications, changes to physical activity, or surgery.
In many cases, early detection and intervention can help to improve outcomes for children.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy
Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare form of heart failure that can occur near the end of pregnancy or up to a year after giving birth. The heart muscle becomes weak, causing a buildup of fluid in the lungs.
Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swollen ankles or legs. Because these symptoms can also occur in a normal pregnancy, recognition and treatment for this condition can be delayed.
Women who are pregnant or who have recently delivered a baby should seek medical care immediately if they are experiencing any urgent maternal warning signs. These symptoms could indicate a life-threatening situation.
Treatment may include close monitoring by the woman's health care team and prescription medication.
Many medicines may be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, including diuretics, beta-blockers, or blood thinners.8
The risk of PPCM is higher for Black women and for women who are older than 30, who are pregnant with more than one fetus, or who have a history of preeclampsia or chronic high blood pressure.9
Symptoms
Some people who have cardiomyopathy never have symptoms, while others may show signs as the disease progresses. These might include the following:
Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.
Fatigue.
Swelling in the ankles and legs.
Irregular heart beat or palpitations.
Syncope, the medical term for fainting or briefly passing out.
Causes
Although the cause of cardiomyopathy is sometimes unknown, certain diseases or conditions can lead to cardiomyopathy. These include the following:1234
A family history of cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest.
Connective tissue disease and other types of autoimmune disease.
Coronary heart disease or a heart attack.
Diseases that can damage the heart, such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis or amyloidosis.
Endocrine diseases, including thyroid conditions and diabetes.
Infections in the heart muscle.
Long-term alcoholism or cocaine abuse.
Muscle conditions such as muscular dystrophy.
Pregnancy.
Treatment and recovery
The goal of treatment is to slow down the disease, control symptoms, and prevent sudden death. If you are diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, your doctor may tell you to change your diet and physical activity, reduce stress, avoid alcohol and other drugs, and take medicines. Your doctor may also treat you for the conditions that led to cardiomyopathy, if they exist, or recommend surgery. Treatment also depends on which type of cardiomyopathy you have.
Genetic or inherited types of cardiomyopathy cannot be prevented. Adopting or following a healthier lifestyle can help control symptoms and complications. If you have an underlying disease or condition that can cause cardiomyopathy, early treatment of that condition can help prevent the disease from developing.

Caregivers of a Person with Alzheimer's Disease or a Related Dementia
WHAT TO KNOW
Family members or friends often become caregivers for adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
While caregiving can be rewarding, it can also be hard on the caregiver's health.
Over half of family caregivers provide care for four years or more.
There are ways to care for yourself while caring for others.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
People with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are usually cared for by family members or friends. If you become a caregiver, it's important to take care of your own health too.
Facts
Caregiving for someone with Alzheimer's disease
People with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are usually cared for by family members or friends.
About 80% of adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias receive care in their homes.
Over 11 million U.S. adults provide unpaid care for someone with a form of dementia.
In 2023, caregivers provided about 18.4 billion hours of care to someone with dementia.
These caregivers often provide care longer than those caring for people with other conditions.
Nearly 1 in 3 of family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and related dementias provides care for four years or more.
Who are caregivers?
Approximately two-thirds of dementia caregivers are women.
About 1 in 3 caregivers (30%) is 65 or older.
About one-quarter are ""sandwich generation"" caregivers. This means that they care for both an aging parent and at least one child under 18.
Spotlight
Caring for Yourself When Caring for Another
Caregiving can be rewarding. It can also be demanding and may make it hard for caregivers to take care of themselves.
Caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and related dementias are at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and a poorer quality of life than other caregivers.
Self-care isn't selfish. It's crucial to look after your own health.

About Cascade Testing
KEY POINTS
Cascade testing is the process of informing family members of a genetic condition discovered within the family, followed by family members getting tested for the condition.
A genetic counselor or healthcare provider can help determine which family members should be tested first.
Overview
Many people do not know they have a genetic condition until symptoms of that condition begin to affect their lives. By then, treatments might be less likely to work. Cascade testing offers one way of finding people with genetic conditions before they show symptoms, allowing them to take steps to prevent disease or treat it early.
How it works
If you have been diagnosed with a genetic condition, your family members are more likely to have it, too. Sharing your diagnosis with your family members allows them to learn more and be checked for the condition. Finding and treating a genetic condition early can lead to better health.
Family members who are most likely to have the same genetic change, or mutation, are tested first. From there, genetic testing ""cascades"" through the family depending on who has the genetic change and who does not. For example, if genetic testing shows that your mother has the same genetic change that you have, family members on your mother's side would be tested. Your father's side would not need to be tested.
How to share your diagnosis with your family members
The first step in cascade testing is to let your family members know about your diagnosis and genetic test results. Here are some tips to get started:
Gather information to share with your family members. This may include the following:
Your diagnosis
Your genetic test report(s): Providing a copy of your genetic test report for your family members to take to a genetic counselor may help your family members receive testing quicker.
Your lab results related to the condition (such as blood work): Some genetic conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, can be diagnosed without genetic testing.
Determine which family members should be tested first. A genetic counselor or medical provider can help you with this.
Your children, sisters, brothers, and parents are most likely to have the same genetic condition. Testing should start with them, with the limitation that genetic testing for adult-onset conditions is not generally done in children.
If a family member is not available for testing (for example, the family member does not want to be tested or has died), then moving to more distant family members is appropriate.
Decide how you would like to share the information with your family members. Below are some options:
Talk to your family members directly. Your genetic counselor can help you plan how to tell your family members, including what information is most important.
Write a letter explaining your diagnosis, including any related genetic testing and lab results. Sample letters are available for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, and familial hypercholesterolemia.
Ask a family member to help you tell other members in your family. If you are unsure of how to contact certain family members, having another family member contact them may help you get the information out to more family members.
Ask family members to attend a genetic counseling or doctor's appointment with you. If you are unsure or concerned about how to describe the condition to your family, a genetic counselor or doctor can assist. In addition, your doctor or genetic counselor might be able to provide a family letter explaining your diagnosis. Sample letters are available for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome.
Common questions
What if my family members do not want to talk about hereditary conditions and cascade testing?
Talking about having an increased risk of developing cancer, heart disease, or other hereditary conditions may be difficult for some family members. Before talking to family members about their risk of having the same genetic change, it could be helpful to anticipate possible reactions. For example, if you think that a family member might get emotional from learning this information, it might be best to tell them about this in a comfortable, private area.
If a family member refuses to talk about this information, it is important to respect their decision. Some people do not want to know about their risks for developing certain diseases because it will cause them too much anxiety. However, you can offer them other options, so they can get the information on their own terms. For example, you can provide them information on how to talk to a genetic counselor or give them a letter that they can open whenever they are ready. Sample letters are available for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, and familial hypercholesterolemia.
How do I talk to my children?
The process of talking to children about hereditary conditions may differ from talking to adult family members. Your children’s immediate concern might be how the condition will affect your health and the impact that will have on them. Your child’s age may affect how you talk to them about your condition and their chances of having it. For younger children, it may be helpful to tell them smaller pieces of information over time to allow them time to process the information you share. Older children may want to learn all the information in one conversation, and then want to talk to a medical provider about their own health risks. A genetic counselor can help you plan how to tell your children about your condition and their risks, and provide information on when your children should get genetic testing.
Next steps
After sharing this information with your family members, they may ask you what they should do. Below are some tips to help your family members get checked for the genetic condition:
Your family members can get genetic counseling. A genetic counselor can help your family members order genetic tests. You can contact your genetic counselor for help, or you can find other genetic counselors using the National Society of Genetic Counselors directory
. Genetic counselors are available through in-person and telehealth appointments.
Encourage your family members to tell their healthcare providers about your diagnosis. Their healthcare providers can help them determine the best management plan.
Important topics to discuss
Family members may have some concerns after you share this information with them. You and your family members might want to talk to a medical provider or genetic counselor about the following:
Genetic testing may be free: Some genetic testing companies offer free cascade testing for family members. Contact your genetic counselor or doctor who ordered your testing to see if your family members qualify. In some cases, free testing is only available for a certain amount of time after a family member's genetic test.
Insurance protections: Genetic test results are protected under the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA)
. This legislation prohibits health insurance companies and employers from discriminating against an individual based on their genetic information. However, GINA does not protect individuals from discrimination by life, disability, or long-term care insurance companies.
Community support: You and your family members might find it helpful to connect with others with the same genetic condition. One way to do this is through online support groups such as Kintalk
, FORCE (Cancer)
, the Family Heart Foundation (familial hypercholesterolemia)
, and Genetic Alliance (rare genetic disorders)
. Your genetic counselor may have additional resources to help you and your family connect to other families. The Disease Info Search database
includes information on support groups for several different genetic conditions.

NOVEMBER 6, 2024
Overview of CASPER
AT A GLANCE
The Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) can provide information about a community so public health leaders and emergency managers can make informed decisions. CASPER is quick, relatively inexpensive, flexible, and uses a simple reporting format. It uses a valid sampling methodology to collect information at the household level.
About
CASPER is a type of rapid needs assessment (RNA) that provides household-level information to public health leaders and emergency managers. CASPER can provide accurate and timely data for decision makers through precise analysis and interpretation. CASPER is a cross-sectional epidemiologic design; it is not surveillance.
Information from CASPERs can help public health and emergency managers:
Initiate public health action
Identify information gaps
Facilitate disaster planning, response, and recovery activities
Allocate resources
Collect and assess new or changing needs in the community
Interactive Map of CASPERs
See the interactive map for examples of how CASPER has been used throughout the United States since 2001.
The CASPER methodology is an adaptation of epidemiologic techniques used by scientists in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) who estimate vaccine coverage in Africa.
CASPER's cluster sampling design involves two stages. The first stage includes 30 clusters selected probability proportional to size. The second stage includes seven households interviewed within each cluster. This design provides estimates for the population.
There may be situations in which this design is not feasible or ideal. Modifications are acceptable. For additional information, read the CASPER Overview fact sheet.
There are many opportunities for CASPERs to influence public health. A CASPER can be used in both a disaster and non-disaster setting.
For example, CASPER methodology has been used to do the following:
Analyze public health perceptions
Estimate needs of a community
Assist in planning for emergency response
Benefits of CASPER
Information is key for decision-making. Information sent to the right people, at the right place, at the right time, is optimal for any successful response. CASPER addresses this by providing valid information rapidly about the general and health needs of a community to decision-makers. CASPER is generalizable (providing population estimates), timely, relatively low cost, reported in a simple format, and flexible.
CASPER was originally designed to provide information during a disaster response. It can also be used when population-representative data are needed during other disaster phases (preparedness, recovery, mitigation). Additionally, it can be used in situations unrelated to a disaster. For example, public health departments have used CASPER to:
Identify household-level information about community health status
Learn more about emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika virus and H1N1
Assess community awareness/opinions/concerns on subjects such as the following:
Climate change
Opioid use
Healthy homes
Radiation emergency preparedness
Goals
The primary goals of the CASPER are to rapidly obtain information about the needs of an affected community and to assess changes in needs during the response or recovery period. CASPER also produces household-based population estimates of needs for decision makers.
Examples of CASPER objectives include the following:
Determine the critical health needs
Assess the impact of a disaster on the community
Characterize the population residing in the area including any ongoing health effects
Evaluate the effectiveness of recovery efforts using a follow-up CASPER
CASPER is not intended to deliver food, medicine, medical services or other resources to the affected area or to provide direct services to residents such as cleanup or home repair.
CASPER toolkit
In the early 2000s, the two-stage cluster method became an increasingly widespread method for disaster response. CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health developed the CASPER Toolkit to outline and standardize the assessment methodology. CDC coined the term CASPER to distinguish it from other rapid needs assessments.
The CASPER toolkit provides guidelines to assist personnel from any federal, state, tribal, local, or territorial (STLT) public health department or other emergency response agencies in conducting CASPER. The toolkit is focused on United States disaster response. However, it may also be adapted for use in a non-disaster or international setting.
The toolkit provides a standardized, step-by-step guide for conducting a CASPER, including:
Preparing a checklist
Questionnaire development
Sample selection
Training
Data collection
Analysis
Report writing
Templates and examples
Public health personnel, emergency management officials, academics, or others who wish to assess household-level public health needs will find the toolkit useful for rapid data collection for actionable decision-making during disaster or non-emergency situations.

CASPER Field Materials
Using CASPER data
Data from CASPERs are used for the following:
Provide situational awareness
Confirm (or contradict) rumors or anecdotal reports
Identify and provide estimates of needs in the community, such as food, water, medication
Establish priorities
Tailor interventions and communication messaging
Other potential benefits of CASPER data include the following:
Monitor changes in community needs
Raise visibility of emergency management and public health in the community
Justify requests for outside assistance or funding
Evaluate the effectiveness of response activities
Serve as field exercise to build capacity and prepare the workforce for emergency situations
CASPER data have been useful to support resource allocation, fund projects or services, tailor messages, and inform future planning.

Interactive Map
Getting started
During a disaster, the local, state, or regional emergency managers or health department officers may decide to initiate a CASPER when at least one of the following conditions occurs:
The effect of the disaster on the population is unknown
The health status and basic needs of those affected are unknown
Response and recovery efforts need to be evaluated
CASPER methodology can be used in both a disaster and non-disaster setting. CASPERs have been conducted to assess public health perceptions and to estimate needs of a community during a non-disaster setting. Regardless of the setting and objectives, once the decision to conduct the CASPER has been made, it should be initiated as soon as possible. CDC is available for technical assistance for any CASPER, regardless of type (preparedness, response, recovery, non-disaster, etc.).
Considerations
Prior to conducting a CASPER, consider whether CASPER provides an appropriate sampling methodology based on your:
Objectives
Timeframe
Available resources
A clear understanding of how CASPER information will be used, who the relevant partners are, and needed and available resources is important prior to moving forward with your CASPER.
Remember, a CASPER will be descriptive of the entire sampling frame (geographic area from which your sample is drawn). It will not provide detailed information on subpopulations or specific groups. For example, if you want to determine the needs or status of pregnant women or persons experiencing homelessness, you should not conduct a CASPER.
CASPER phases
There are four phases in a CASPER: prepare for the CASPER; conduct the CASPER in the field; analyze the data; and write the report.
Phase 1: Prepare for CASPER
Checklist to prepare for CASPER.
As you prepare to conduct a CASPER, there are many planning questions that should be addressed.
Work with leadership, key partners, and CASPER subject matter experts (SMEs) within your state or CDC to help plan and prepare. Keep in mind that preparing for a CASPER can take several hours (e.g., during a response) or, if time allows, several months (e.g., in a non-disaster setting).
Keep Reading:
Prepare for CASPER
Phase 2: Conduct the CASPER in the field
Group of volunteers
CASPER is conducted through face-to-face interviews in the field. There are several advantages to conducting face-to-face interviews. These include a high response rate and the ability to distribute health information or other materials to the community.
Face-to-face interviews have the additional benefit of directly connecting the community to local staff, increasing the visibility of and trust in the health department. Interview teams can also provide anecdotal information (e.g., direct visual inspection of a disaster-affected area, common concerns overheard in the community not captured in the questionnaire) that can help guide response and recovery efforts, implementation of any recommendations, and future plans.
Keep Reading:
Conduct the CASPER in the field
Phases 3 and 4: Analyze and report CASPER data
Analyzing CASPER data
Data from the questionnaire can be entered into any statistical software package that allows for multistage sample design weighting. CDC recommends using Epi Info™, which is user-friendly, does not require computer permissions for download, and is available free of charge. Access tutorials and guidance on Epi Info™. Data from the tracking form can be entered into any spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel.
Disseminating findings is a vital component of a CASPER. The information from the CASPER will help partners better understand the needs and health status of the community.

About Bartonella
KEY POINTS
Bartonella bacteria are spread to humans by fleas, body lice, sand flies, or contact with flea-infested animals.
There is no evidence that ticks spread Bartonella infection to people.
Cat scratch disease is the most common form of bartonellosis in the United States.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Several species of Bartonella bacteria cause disease in people. Infection with any one of these bacteria is referred to broadly as bartonellosis, although some forms of infection also have common names (for example, cat scratch disease).
For more information:
Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease)
Bartonella quintana infection
Bartonella bacilliformis infection
B. henselae is transmitted by the scratch of domestic or feral cats. Cats can have fleas that carry the bacteria.
B. quintana is transmitted by the human body louse.
B. bacilliformis is transmitted by bites from infected sand flies.
There is no evidence that Bartonella species can be transmitted to people by ticks. Transmission studies with ticks have only used mice and artificial feeding systems which do not demonstrate that a tick can spread bacteria to people or that the bacteria can survive in a tick for any length of time.

Clinical Safety: Preventing Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTIs)
KEY POINTS
Infection prevention and safe catheter insertion, maintenance, and removal reduce the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
Why it matters
CAUTIs are one of the most common HAIs.
About 75% of UTIs developed in hospitals are associated with a urinary catheter.
15-25% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay.
CAUTIs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs and length of stay.
They are preventable.
Background
A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that involves any of the organs or structures of the urinary tract, (e.g., kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra).
A CAUTI occurs when germs (usually bacteria) enter the urinary tract through the urinary catheter and cause infection.
Recommendations
Only use urinary catheters when needed.
Place catheters using proper germ-free techniques with sterile equipment.
Maintain the catheter's closed sterile drainage system.
Remove catheters as soon as patients no longer need them. Prolonged use is the most important risk factor for CAUTIs.
Healthcare facilities should follow the 2009 CDC Guideline for Prevention of Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections. The guideline emphasizes the proper use, insertion, and maintenance of urinary catheters in different healthcare settings. It also presents effective quality improvement programs that healthcare facilities can use to prevent CAUTIs.
Acute care hospitals should follow Strategies to Prevent Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2022 Update
.
Assessment tools
Facilities can monitor CAUTI rates and assess the effectiveness of prevention efforts through CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
Facilities can also identify infection prevention gaps and launch tailored interventions to reduce CAUTI risk with the Targeted Assessment for Prevention (TAP) Strategy.

Cats
WHAT TO KNOW
Cats can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make people sick.
Wash your hands after handling, cleaning up after, or feeding cats.
Provide your cat with routine veterinary care to keep it healthy and prevent the spread of diseases.
Overview
Nearly 40 million households in the United States have pet cats. Research has shown that cats can provide emotional support, improve moods, and contribute to the overall morale of their owners. Cats are also credited with promoting socialization among older people and physically or mentally disabled people.
Although cats are great companions, cat owners should be aware that sometimes cats can carry harmful germs that can make people sick. This can happen even when they appear healthy and clean.
Diseases
Below is a list of diseases that can be spread by cats.
Campylobacter infection
Cat scratch disease
Cat tapeworm
Cryptosporidiosis
Giardia infection
Hookworm
MRSA
Plague
Rabies
Ringworm
Roundworms
Salmonella infection
Sporotrichosis
Tickborne diseases
Toxoplasmosis
Tularemia
How to stay healthy around cats
Make sure a cat is the right type of pet for your family before buying or adopting a pet.
Wash your hands
Wash your hands with soap and running water:
After handling cats, their food and water dishes, or their supplies
After contact with cat saliva or poop
After cleaning a litter box
After gardening, especially if outdoor cats live in the area
Before you eat or drink
Adults should supervise hand washing for children under 5 years old. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Wear gloves while gardening, particularly if you know that outdoor cats live in the area.
Safely clean up after your cat
Cats can carry many germs in their poop. To stay healthy, take precautions when cleaning a cat's litter box. Change litter boxes daily. Always wash your hands after cleaning the litter box, even if you use a scoop to remove the poop.
People at high risk for complications
People with weakened immune systems and pregnant women should not clean litter boxes, if possible. They are more at risk for complications from germs spread by cats. If no one else can perform the task, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands afterwards.
Keep your cat's litter box away from other animals, children, and food preparation areas.
Prevent cat scratches and bites
Always supervise children around cats to prevent bites and scratches.
Cat bites and scratches can spread germs, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious. For example, cat scratch disease can happen if a scratch only breaks the surface of the skin.
We don’t know exactly how many people are bitten or scratched by cats each year because incidents often aren’t reported. However, we do know that about 20-80% of reported cat bites and scratches become infected.
Use caution around unfamiliar cats
Be cautious with unfamiliar animals.
Avoid rough play
Avoid rough play with cats and kittens. Rough play causes cats to be defensive toward people. Avoid rough play when animals are young. This will lead to fewer scratches and bites as animals become older.
Regularly trim your cat's nails
Studies have shown cats generally bite when provoked. Trim your cat's nails regularly. If you need help, ask your veterinarian.
Educate children
Teach children to inform their parents or an adult if they are ever bitten or scratched by any animal, including cats.
What to do if you are bitten or scratched by a cat
If you are bitten or scratched by a cat, you should:
Wash wounds with warm soapy water immediately. Seek medical attention if:
You don't know if the cat has been vaccinated against rabies.
The cat appears sick.
The wound is serious.
The wound becomes red, painful, warm or swollen.
It has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot.
Report the bite to animal control or your local health department if the bite is unprovoked and
The cat is a stray, or
You are unsure if the cat has been vaccinated against rabies.
Cat bites carry the risk of spreading rabies to humans. Ensure the cat is seen by a veterinarian if it becomes sick or dies shortly after the bite. Report the bite by contacting your local health department.
How to keep pet cats healthy
Keeping your pet cat healthy helps keep your family healthy too.
Before choosing a cat
Certain types of cat or kitten adoptions may not be suitable for your family because of the risk for disease. This includes international pet adoptions. Use caution if young children, pregnant women, or people with weakened immune systems live in the household.
Research and learn how to properly care for your cat or kitten before you purchase or adopt. Ask your veterinarian or pet store staff how to properly care for the cat or kitten you are selecting. This includes asking about the best food and enclosure or environment for your potential pet.
Be aware that cats may shed Toxoplasma, Giardia, hookworms, roundworms and other germs in their poop. Plan to change the litterbox daily and always wash your hands after.
How to choose a cat
Match a cat's personality and activity levels with:
Your family,
The animals you already have in your household, and
The amount of time you have to spend with your pet.
Pick a cat that is bright, alert, and playful. Cats and kittens should have shiny, soft fur that is free of poop and debris.
Take your new cat or kitten to the veterinarian within a few days to a week after adoption.
If you adopt a sick cat
Signs of sickness in a cat include:
Appearing sluggish or depressed
Having diarrhea
Abnormal breathing
Fluid running from its eyes or nose
If your cat becomes sick or dies soon after purchase or adoption, take it to the veterinarian promptly. Inform the pet store, breeder, or rescue organization about the pet's illness or death. Make sure to tell your veterinarian if the pet was adopted from a shelter or from international pet adoption.
How to house your cat
Provide a safe, warm, and comfortable environment for your cat to live in. Talk to your veterinarian about creating a safe environment for your cat.
If you allow your cat outside, provide shelter when it is cold or rainy and shade when it is hot. Your cat should have access to the indoors at night to stay safe from predators.
Make sure your cat has access to food and fresh water every day. Be aware that leaving food outdoors for your cat may attract unwanted wildlife. This wildlife can spread diseases to your cat.
Each cat in a household should have its own litterbox plus one additional box.
Monitor your cat’s health
Make sure your cat gets regular veterinary care.
Take your cat to the veterinarian regularly to keep it healthy and prevent infectious diseases. Talk to your veterinarian about preventive treatments for fleas, heartworms, ticks, and other parasites.
Contact your veterinarian if you notice any signs of illness in your pet. Keep in mind that even cats that look healthy can spread germs to people and other animals.
Make sure to clean up any urine, poop, or vomit in the house immediately, and disinfect the area after cleaning. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.
Get your cat vaccinated
Vaccinations can help protect your cat from dangerous diseases and help them live a longer, healthier life. Keep your cat up-to-date on routine vaccinations like rabies and feline distemper vaccine.
Ask your veterinarian about other vaccines you may need or want for your cat, like feline leukemia.
Keep your veterinarian informed
Tell your veterinarian about your cat's lifestyle. This includes whether your cat is indoor, outdoor, or both. Tell your veterinarian if there are other animals at home or that the cat may come into contact with.
Protect your cat from ticks
Talk to your veterinarian about the best tick prevention products for your cat and tickborne diseases in your area.
Cats are extremely sensitive to a variety of chemicals. Do not apply any tick prevention products to your cat without first asking your veterinarian.

About CDC
AT A GLANCE
CDC is the nation's leading science-based, data-driven, service organization that protects the public's health.
CDC puts science into action to help children stay healthy so they can grow and learn; to help families, businesses, and communities fight disease and stay strong; and to protect the public's health.
Learn more about CDC's mission, priorities, role, and core values.
Our mission
CDC works 24/7 to protect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same.
CDC increases the health security of our nation. As the nation's health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats. To accomplish our mission, CDC conducts critical science and provides health information that protects our nation against expensive and dangerous health threats and responds when these arise.
Priorities
The 2022-2027 CDC Strategic Plan advances science and health equity and affirms the agency's commitment to one unified vision— equitably protecting health, safety, and security. The plan continues to leverage 5 core capabilities of the agency, reflecting our commitment to equity and diversity and lifting up where we have invested through the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work is underscored by the agency's Pledge to the American People and dedication to use timely data and science to drive and communicate customer-centered, high-impact public health action.
CDC Moving Forward
In April 2022, CDC launched an effort to refine and modernize its structures, systems, and processes around developing and deploying our science and programs. The goal was to learn how to pivot our long-standing practices and adapt to pandemics and other public health emergencies, then to apply those lessons across the organization. The effort included a review of key workflows, with a particular focus on ensuring CDC's science reaches the public in an understandable, accessible, and implementable manner as quickly as possible.
CDC Moving Forward

About The Epidemiology Elective Program
AT A GLANCE
The Epidemiology Elective Program (EEP) is an elective rotation for medical and veterinary students. Most students earn academic course credit.
EEP offers 6- and 8-week rotations. Students learn applied epidemiology through training, project assignments, and mentorship from public health experts.
Project assignments are with CDC, other federal agencies, and state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments.
Background
The Epidemiology Elective Program (EEP) is a short-term, service-learning rotation in applied epidemiology. Medical and veterinary students learn through training, project assignments, and mentorship from public health experts.
Students can participate in a 6- or 8-week rotation. Projects assignments are with CDC, other federal agencies, and state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments. Every effort is made to place students with a host site that provides experience in leadership and project in a topic area of the student's interest.
Project assignments involve helping public health experts investigate public health problems such as infectious disease outbreaks, natural disasters, chronic diseases, and poor access to healthcare.
Most schools award academic course credit for participation in EEP.
View Larger
Check out and share the EEP flyer.
Impact
More than 2,100 medical and veterinary students have completed EEP since its inception in 1975. Many students go on to participate in CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program and become public health leaders.
Meet Amy Xie, MD, a 2020 EEP student who joined EIS in 2023
Dr. Xie had this to say about her EEP rotation: ""Working alongside a CDC medical officer and EIS officer during a coronavirus field investigation enabled me to learn about public health response through first-hand experience. I got to see how decisions are made and how an incident command team is structured. I had the chance to contribute to field investigation information that was published in two Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports. I see great value in being a physician with epidemiology training!""

Central Line-associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
FEBRUARY 21, 2024
Central Line-associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) Basics
KEY POINTS
Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) occur when germs enter the bloodstream through a central line.
CLABSIs are preventable.
Overview
Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in thousands of deaths each year and billions of dollars in added costs to the U.S. healthcare system – but they are preventable.
A central line (also known as a central venous catheter) is a catheter (tube) that healthcare providers often place in a large vein in the neck, chest or groin to give medication or fluids or to collect blood for medical tests. Central lines are different from peripheral IVs (shorter IVs placed in the hand, arm or foot for vein access); central lines access a major vein close to the heart, can remain in place for weeks or months, and are much more likely to be a source of serious infection. Central lines are commonly used in intensive care units.
Healthcare providers may insert central lines to:
Give medicines for treatment of pain, infection or other medical issues (e.g., cancer or heart problems).
Provide fluids or nutrition.
Help conduct certain medical tests.
Types
Types of central lines
Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Placed into a vein in the arm.
Tunneled catheter. Passed under the skin and placed into a vein in the chest or neck. Providers can insert medicine right into the catheter.
Implanted port. Surgically placed under the skin. Providers insert medicines using a needle placed through the skin into the catheter. An implanted port is not as visible as a tunneled catheter, does not require as much daily care, and does not get in the way of a patient's regular activities as much as a PICC line or a tunneled catheter might.
Healthcare providers use the type that is best for each patient's care.
Signs and symptoms
People with CLABSIs may experience:
Fever
Red skin and soreness around the central line
Causes
CLABSIs occur when germs (usually bacteria or fungi) enter the bloodstream through the central line.
Prevention
Healthcare providers should follow recommended infection control guidelines to reduce the risk of CLABSIs.
Patients should:
Speak up
. Talk to your healthcare providers about any questions or worries. Ask what they're doing to protect you.
Ask a healthcare provider about your options and the pros and cons of a central line, if one is needed. If so, ask them to help you understand the need for it and how long it will be in place.
Avoid touching the tubing and where it exits the skin as much as possible.

Crisis & Emergency Risk Communication (CERC)
WHAT TO KNOW
CERC helps communicators and emergency responders better reach people with lifesaving information about disasters and other public health emergencies.CDC’s CERC program offers in-person and virtual CERC trainings for individuals and organizations.
About CERC
CDC’s Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) program provides trainings, tools, and resources to help health communicators, emergency responders, and leaders of organizations communicate effectively about risks during emergencies. CERC draws from lessons learned during past public health emergencies and research in the fields of public health, psychology, and emergency risk communication.
CERC training
Introduction to CERC
Introduction to CERC is a full-day (8-hour) CERC training that helps participants understand CERC principles and recommended practices and how applying them can help reduce harm during an emergency response. Training includes in-depth practice on a variety of skills and techniques relevant to crisis and emergency risk communication. When conducted virtually, this course usually takes place over the course of two consecutive days in four-hour sessions.
CERC for Leaders
CERC for Leaders is a half-day (4-hour) training designed to help emergency response leaders who are not communication experts understand the role of CERC in reducing harm during emergencies.
CERC Workshop
A CERC workshop lasts 2–3 hours and provides an overview of the core CERC and plain language principles. Workshops include limited practice on applying the concepts presented.
CERC Presentation
A CDC CERC trainer can talk with your organization for 60 minutes about how CERC can enhance emergency response efforts, protect health, and improve lives.
Who this training is for
For Organizations
Contact the CERC program at cercrequest@cdc.gov to learn if CERC training is right for your organization. If the CERC program can meet your needs, we can discuss whether in-person training or virtual training via Zoom is the better option. There is no charge for the training itself. However, for in-person training, the host is responsible for the instructors’ travel costs including airfare, lodging, meals, and ground transportation. In general, Department of Health and Human Services grant funds cannot be used to pay for these expenses.
For Individuals
The CERC program offers virtual Introduction to CERC trainings via Zoom that are open to public health professionals and emergency responders.
Add yourself to the waitlist
If you would like to be added to the waitlist to be notified of upcoming CERC training opportunities, please reach out to the CERC program by emailing cercrequest@cdc.gov.

Swimmer's Itch (Cercarial Dermatitis)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
PARASITES 
SEPTEMBER 10, 2024
About Swimmer's Itch
KEY POINTS
Swimmer's itch is an infection caused by a parasite.
It can cause an allergic reaction and rash on your skin.
Swimmer's itch is not contagious and does not spread from person to person.
Overview
Swimmer’s itch, also called cercarial dermatitis, appears as a skin rash caused by an allergic reaction to certain microscopic parasites that infect some birds and mammals. These parasites are released from infected snails into fresh and salt water (such as lakes, ponds, and oceans). While the parasite’s preferred host is the specific bird or mammal, if the parasite comes into contact with a swimmer, it burrows into the skin causing an allergic reaction and rash. Swimmer’s itch is found throughout the world and is more frequent during summer months.
Symptoms
Symptoms can include
tingling, burning, or itching of the skin
small reddish pimples
small blisters
Within minutes to days after swimming in contaminated water, you may experience tingling, burning, or itching of the skin. Small reddish pimples appear within twelve hours. Pimples may develop into small blisters. Scratching the areas may result in secondary bacterial infections. Itching may last up to a week or more but will gradually go away.
Because swimmer’s itch is caused by an allergic reaction to infection, the more often you swim or wade in contaminated water, the more likely you are to develop more serious symptoms. The greater the number of exposures to contaminated water, the more intense and immediate symptoms of swimmer’s itch will be.
Be aware that swimmer's itch is not the only rash that may occur after swimming in fresh or salt water.
Exposure risks
Anyone who swims or wades in infested water may be at risk. Larvae are more likely to be present in shallow water by the shoreline. Children are most often affected because they tend to swim, wade, and play in the shallow water more than adults. Also, they are less likely to towel dry themselves when leaving the water.
Water safety after outbreaks
Many factors must be present for swimmer’s itch to become a problem in water. Since these factors change (sometimes within a swim season), swimmer’s itch will not always be a problem. However, there is no way to know how long water may be unsafe. Larvae generally survive for 24 hours once they are released from the snail. However, an infected snail will continue to produce cercariae throughout the remainder of its life. For future snails to become infected, migratory birds or mammals in the area must also be infected so the lifecycle can continue.
Swimming pools
As long as your swimming pool is well maintained and chlorinated, there is no risk of swimmer’s itch. The appropriate snails must be present in order for swimmer’s itch to occur.
Resource
Prevent Swimming-related Illnesses
How it spreads
The adult parasite lives in the blood of infected animals such as ducks, geese, gulls, swans, and certain mammals such as muskrats and raccoons. The parasites produce eggs that are passed in the feces of infected birds or mammals.
If the eggs land in or are washed into the water, the eggs hatch, releasing small, free-swimming microscopic larvae. These larvae swim in the water in search of a certain species of aquatic snail.
If the larvae find one of these snails, they infect the snail, multiply and undergo further development. Infected snails release a different type of microscopic larvae (or cercariae, hence the name cercarial dermatitis) into the water. This larval form then swims about searching for a suitable host (bird, muskrat) to continue the lifecycle. Although humans are not suitable hosts, the microscopic larvae burrow into the swimmer’s skin, and may cause an allergic reaction and rash. Because these larvae cannot develop inside a human, they soon die.
Reducing risk
To reduce the likelihood of developing swimmer’s itch
Do not swim in areas where swimmer's itch is a known problem or where signs have been posted warning of unsafe water.
Do not swim near or wade in marshy areas where snails are commonly found.
Towel dry or shower immediately after leaving the water.
Do not attract birds (e.g., by feeding them) to areas where people are swimming.
Encourage health officials to post signs on shorelines where swimmer's itch is a current problem.
Resource
How to Safely visit Oceans, Lakes, and Rivers
Treatment
Most cases of swimmer’s itch do not require medical attention. If you have a rash, you may try the following for relief:
Use corticosteroid cream
Apply cool compresses to the affected areas
Bathe in Epsom salts or baking soda
Soak in colloidal oatmeal baths
Apply baking soda paste to the rash (made by stirring water into baking soda until it reaches a paste-like consistency)
Use an anti-itch lotion
Though difficult, try not to scratch. Scratching may cause the rash to become infected. If itching is severe, your health care provider may suggest prescription-strength lotions or creams to lessen your symptoms.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protects privacy and confidentiality in accordance with federal laws.
CDC uses Certificates of Confidentiality and other resources to protect identifiable and potentially identifiable information.
Overview
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commits to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information we have, in accordance with federal laws. The Privacy and Confidentiality Unit (PCU) provides guidance on privacy and confidentiality for all federally funded and supported activities through consultation and issuance of Assurances of Confidentiality to CDC programs.
Privacy
CDC provides technical support and education to CDC employees; grantees; partners; and state, Tribal, and local health departments on:
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
Other federal privacy laws.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
The HIPAA Privacy Rule
(45 CFR Parts 160
and 164
) regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, called protected health information (PHI), by covered entities. The Privacy Rule protects all PHI transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g. electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity or its business associates. It excludes certain educational and employment records.
The Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights in respect to their health information including, but not limited to, the right to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of their privacy rights and how their PHI will be used and disclosed.
The Privacy Rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without the written authorization from the individual; however, there are several exceptions to this requirement including disclosures
for public health activities.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g
; 34 CFR Part 99
) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Health care information is generally part of the education record. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
FERPA gives parents certain rights regarding their child's education record. These rights include the right to inspect and request corrections to the record. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.
FERPA generally prohibits the disclosure of any personally identifiable information contained in an education record without the appropriate written consent. FERPA offers limited exceptions to this requirement.
Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality (CoCs) protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable and potentially identifiable research information, with limited exceptions.
Any investigator or institution issued a CoC shall not:
Disclose or provide covered information, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding.
Disclose or provide covered information to any other person not connected with the research.
CDC investigators with a CoC may ONLY disclose identifiable and potentially identifiable information in the following circumstances:
If required by other federal, state, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases.
If the subject consents.
For the purposes of scientific research that is compliant with human subjects' regulations.
CoCs cover any CDC-funded research project collecting or using identifiable and potentially identifiable information, in compliance with Section 301(d)
of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). All CDC-funded research activities are automatically issued a CoC through their award. No physical certificate will be issued. The CoC will apply as a term and condition of award. This applies to:
Grants.
Cooperative Agreements.
Contracts.
CDC-sponsored intramural research.
For research activities enrolling human participants, CDC requires investigators to inform participants of the CoC protections and the limits to those protections.
Assurance of Confidentiality
An Assurance of Confidentiality (AoC) is a formal confidentiality protection authorized under Section 308(d)
of the PHSA. CDC investigators use it to collect or maintain sensitive identifiable information from individuals and institutions. The law states that no identifiable information may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied. The exception is if such institution or individual consented to that disclosure. Protected information includes identifiable information on institutions or individuals who are the subjects of non-research, public health activities with an approved AoC.
CDC implements agency AoC protection for public health activities conducted by CDC investigators that involve the collection or maintenance of identifiable information. This protection allows CDC programs to assure individuals and institutions involved in non-research activities (e.g., surveillance) that those conducting the activity will protect the confidentiality of the identifiable data collected.
Disclosures can be made without individual authorization only for purposes stated at the time of data collection or specifically consented to thereafter by each of the parties provided the promise of confidentiality.

Chapare Hemorrhagic Fever (CHHF)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
JANUARY 30, 2025
About Chapare Hemorrhagic Fever
KEY POINTS
Chapare hemorrhagic fever (CHHF) is a rare viral disease that is likely spread by rodents.
CHHF is deadly and about 60% of people with the disease die.
There is no treatment for CHHF.
Only two small CCHF outbreaks have been documented. Both occurred in Bolivia.
What it is
Chapare hemorrhagic fever (CHHF) is a type of illness caused by infection with Chapare virus. Arenaviruses usually spread to people through contact with saliva, urine, and droppings of infected rodents.
There have been two documented outbreaks of CHHF. The first occurred in 2003 in Chapare Province, Bolivia. It resulted in one death. The second outbreak occurred in 2019 in Caranavi Province, Bolivia. It sickened five people and three of them died.
Healthcare providers:
Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like CHHF, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of CHHF resemble those of other South American hemorrhagic fevers, such as Argentine hemorrhagic fever or Bolivian hemorrhagic fever.
Due to the low number of known illnesses from the Chapare virus, there is limited information about the disease.
Documented signs and symptoms of CHHF include:
Fever
Headache
Joint and muscle pain
Pain behind the eyes
Stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea
Bleeding gums
Rash
Irritability
Evidence suggests that pregnant women who are infected with Chapare virus may have complications, including miscarriage or death of the mother or newborn.
How it spreads
People can become infected with the Chapare virus by:
Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent
Eating foods contaminated with the saliva, urine, or droppings from infected rodents
Close contact with body fluids of an infected person infected
Breathing in the virus when it is stirred up into the air
It is unknown if Chapare virus can be spread from mother to child during birth. However, other viruses in the Arenavirus family, the virus family in which Chapare virus belongs, are known to infect the fetus when it is in the uterus.
Prevention
If you are in a place where CHHF occurs, avoid areas that are infested with rodents and other small mammals, or where you see signs of rodent infestation, such as droppings.
Avoid contact with the body fluids of people who are sick with CHHF until they have tested negative.
Healthcare providers should use standard, contact and droplet precautions, with eye protection while managing suspected or confirmed CHHF cases. They should use airborne precautions when performing procedures that could cause the virus to spray into the air.
Keep Reading:
Prevent rodent infestations
Testing and Diagnosis
Healthcare providers can diagnose CHHF with blood tests that detect the virus, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There are currently no antibody tests that can tell if someone had the virus in the past.
Clinicians should notify their state or local health department if a patient has recently been in an area with Chapare virus and has compatible symptoms.
Treatment and recovery
There is currently no treatment for CHHF. Supportive therapy can help people recover from and survive Chapare. This includes:
Providing fluids and electrolytes (body salts)
Using medication to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and manage fever and pain
Treating other infection, if they occur
Even months after symptoms stop, people who recover from CHHF may continue to shed virus in their blood, saliva, urine, or semen. Healthcare providers should monitor these fluids for Chapare virus. Recovering patients could possibly infect others, particularly sexual partners or other household members.

APRIL 2, 2024
National Chemical and Radiological Surveillance Program
AT A GLANCE
CDC works with poison centers from across the country to protect the nation from public health threats by monitoring calls to the National Poison Data System.
Overview
Roughly every 8 minutes, call data from poison centers across the country are uploaded to a national reporting database and electronic surveillance system called the National Poison Data System
(NPDS). CDC and America's Poison Centers
use the database to improve surveillance of chemical exposures and public health hazards.
How it works
Scientists from CDC and America's Poison Centers monitor NPDS every day. They watch for any data anomalies that may represent incidents of public health significance such as outbreaks of illness. Anomalies can include an increase in the number of calls or an increase in reports of specific signs and symptoms.
When anomalies are identified, CDC and America's Poison Centers assist with further activities. This can include performing enhanced surveillance or notifying the state health department and assisting with a public health investigation.
Learn how public health surveillance identifies and responds to incidents of public health significance from poison center data with this flowchart.
Contacting your poison center
You can contact your local poison center by calling 1-800-222-1222. You will automatically be connected to the poison center covering your area.
For an online option, the PoisonHelp.org
interactive tool
prompts users to answer a few simple questions about their exposure to one of the approximately 325,000 unique products and substances in the system.
Did you know?
The nation's 55 poison centers help with poisoning emergencies and provide information to help prevent poisonings.
Program highlights
Carbon monoxide exposure surveillance during disaster response and recovery efforts (ongoing)
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that can lead to sudden illness or death if inhaled at high concentrations. After a disaster, there may be power outages. This can result in people using alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating, cooling, or cooking. These sources can lead to elevated CO levels in enclosed spaces, poisoning people and animals inside.
CDC uses NPDS
for surveillance during disaster response and recovery efforts to track reported exposures to CO. Using these data can help inform public health messaging to prevent further injury and death.
Identifying an increase in exposures to cleaners and disinfectants (2020)
In April 2020, CDC published a report that described an increase in calls to poison centers about exposures to cleaners and disinfectants. Using data from NPDS, CDC and America's Poison Centers found that poison centers nationwide received 45,550 calls regarding exposures to cleaners and disinfectants during the first three months of 2020-an increase of about 20% from the same timeframe in 2019. The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and disinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders.
The results of this study highlighted the importance of safe and appropriate use of cleaners and disinfectants to prevent potential poisonings and injuries.
Identifying sources of harmful algal and cyanobacterial bloom exposures (2019)
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria that can cause harm to people, animals, and the environment. In 2019, CDC and America’s Poison Centers worked with five poison centers to conduct follow-up surveys with people who had called regarding a HAB exposure. Fifty-five people were interviewed. Most callers (65%) stated they were exposed through multiple routes with the most common being skin contact (84%) and ingestion (60%). The most frequently reported source of exposure was bathing or swimming in contaminated water. Few callers had heard or read warnings about the dangers of HABs before or during their exposure.
This study highlights the importance of characterizing exposures to HABs to tailor public health messaging.
Increasing awareness of synthetic cannabinoids (2015)
CDC launched an investigation in April 2015 after being alerted to an increase in poison center calls related to synthetic cannabinoids, also known as synthetic marijuana. The results, published in MMWR, led to a surge in media coverage on this issue that created a broader awareness of issues and dangers of using synthetic cannabinoids.
Reporting poisoning from electronic cigarettes (2014)
Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are devices that heat a liquid mixture to allow users to inhale an aerosol that typically contains nicotine, flavorings, and other additives. While long-term impacts of these products on public health are unknown, one area of concern is the potential for poisonings. A CDC study found that 2,405 e-cigarette exposures were reported to poison centers from September 2010 to February 2014.
This work informed public health actions including the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, enacted in January 2016. This law requires any container of liquid nicotine that is sold, manufactured, distributed, or imported into the United States use packaging that is difficult for children under 5 years of age to open.
Improving consumer safety for laundry pods (2012)
From May 17–June 17, 2012, poison centers across the country reported 485 cases of children being exposed to detergent-filled laundry pods. CDC partnered with America's Poison Centers and poison centers in Charlotte and Philadelphia to investigate this public health threat. Their work helped contribute to the decision by the largest manufacturer of laundry detergent pods in the United States to add a double latch lid safety feature to their containers. Manufacturers have also worked with poison centers to study risk factors and health outcomes linked to laundry detergent pod exposures.
Tracking concerns during Japan radiological event (2011)
CDC tracked all calls to poison centers related to the 2011 Japan nuclear event. Between March 11 and April 18, NPDS tracked 340 information requests and 64 calls regarding potential radiation, potassium iodide and iodide product exposures. Call details were analyzed daily for situational awareness and to inform public health response efforts. Staff from CDC and America’s Poison Centers performed detailed follow up and data review to confirm exposure status. Surveillance for calls related to potassium iodide (a medication used to prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid) exposures documented adverse outcomes in persons taking this product in response to a perceived risk from this event.
Oil exposures from Deepwater Horizon incident (2010)
During 2010, 1838 calls were received by 57 poison centers related to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill. Of these, 1,160 were self-reported exposures and symptoms, including cough, nausea, headache, eye irritation, throat irritation, chest pain, dizziness, difficulty breathing, and rash. The data were used to identify trends and monitor severity of health effects. This information helped public health officials determine the impact of the oil spill on health. Information was also shared with states to aid in their public health response.

Protective Clothing and Ensembles
Print
NIOSH’s Protective Clothing and Ensembles Program is aimed at protecting the skin from various health hazards that may be encountered in the workplace or during a terrorist attack. The program has evolved over the years to incorporate a broad range of studies of how chemicals and other liquids seep through barrier materials, leak through small holes or interfaces, or change the barrier material to reduce its protection.
In addition to field surveys of chemical protective clothing (CPC) performance, studies continue to examine ways to detect when chemicals have gotten inside CPC, and how to effectively remove chemicals from protective clothing after it has been contaminated. Future efforts will incorporate advanced protective clothing technologies into fully integrated, intelligent ensembles for fire fighters and emergency first responders.

Chemical Safety in the Workplace
AT A GLANCE
NIOSH conducts research and makes recommendations to support the safe use of chemicals in the workplace.
The NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemicals Hazards includes information and recommendations for approximately 700 chemicals.
NIOSH and partners have developed other resources for chemical safety in the workplace.
Overview
Chemicals are an important part of nearly every workplace, from specialized industrial chemicals to everyday cleaning products.
Ensuring the safe use of workplace chemicals has been a focus of NIOSH research since its founding in 1970. NIOSH research related to chemicals includes:
Toxicity studies
Occupational epidemiology
Studies of how to measure chemicals in the work environment
Studies of engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE)
Risk assessment
Health Hazard Evaluations (HHEs)
Communication tools for understanding and managing chemicals safely at work
Spotlight
NIOSH-researcher led blog posts on managing chemical hazards.
Best practices
NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards has industrial hygiene information, including NIOSH recommendations, on approximately 700 chemicals and classes of chemicals found in the workplace.
NIOSH Skin Notation Profiles provide information supplemental to the skin notation published in the NIOSH Pocket Guide. These documents provide a summary of all relevant data used to aid in determining the hazards associated with skin exposures.
Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Values (IDLH) are developed by NIOSH (1) to ensure that workers can escape if their respiratory protection equipment fails, and (2) to indicate a maximum level above which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus, providing maximum worker protection is permitted. Acute or short-term exposures to high concentrations of some airborne chemicals have the ability to quickly overwhelm workers. This can lead to a wide spectrum of undesirable health outcomes.
More on chemical hazards
Browse the NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic Index for more information about chemical hazards. NIOSH has pages on health issues, such as flavorings-related lung disease. NIOSH also has pages on chemical hazards in specific industries, such as healthcare.
International Chemical Safety Cards
The International Chemical Safety Cards (ICSCs)
provide essential safety and health information in a clear and concise way. Workers and occupational safety and health professionals can use ICSCs to understand and prevent harmful exposures. The ICSC project is a joint effort of the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization, with the cooperation of the European Commission.
More than 1,700 ICSCs are available in English, Spanish and 13 additional languages. All cards are available on the multilingual search interface
.
An international group of scientists from institutions concerned with occupational safety and health draft and review ICSCs. The international peer review process ensures the authoritative nature of the Cards. NIOSH helped initiate the ICSC effort and continues to support ICSC development by participating actively in all scientific peer review meetings.
Disclaimer
The International Labour Organization, the World Health Organization, and the European Commission shall not be responsible for the interpretation and use of the information contained in the ICSCs.

Acute Bronchitis
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
APRIL 17, 2024
ESPAÑOL
Chest Cold (Acute Bronchitis) Basics
KEY POINTS
Cough keeping you up at night? Soreness in your chest and feeling tired? You could have a chest cold, often called acute bronchitis.
A virus usually causes chest colds.
Antibiotics will not help you get better if you have a chest cold.
If you're healthy without heart or lung problems or a weakened immune system, this information is for you.
Overview
A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's what makes you cough.
Swelling of airways in the lungs produce mucus in the lungs and makes you cough.
Signs and symptoms
The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is coughing with or without mucus. Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include:
Soreness in the chest
Feeling tired (fatigue)
Mild headache
Mild body aches
Sore throat
Causes
A virus usually causes acute bronchitis. Bacteria can sometimes cause acute bronchitis.
Prevention
You can help prevent acute bronchitis by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including:
Clean your hands.
Get recommended vaccines, such as the flu vaccine.
Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
When to seek medical care
Temperature of 100.4 °F or higher.
Cough with bloody mucus.
Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.
Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks.
Repeated episodes of bronchitis.
This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning.
Talk to a healthcare provider right away
If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.
Treatment
Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own—without antibiotics. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.
How to feel better
Get plenty of rest.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.
Use saline nasal spray or drops to relieve a stuffy nose.
For young children, use a rubber suction bulb to clear mucus.
Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower.
Use throat lozenges or cough drops. Do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years of age.
Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older.
Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicines may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they will not cure your illness.
Over-the-counter medicine and children
Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Some over-the-counter medicines are not recommended for children of certain ages.
Pain relievers:
Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen.
Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain.
Cough and cold medicines:
Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children.
Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child's healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child.
Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking.
Similar diseases
Other illnesses like whooping cough (pertussis) or pneumonia can have similar symptoms to acute bronchitis. If you have whooping cough or pneumonia, your healthcare provider will most likely prescribe antibiotics.

Radiographic Screening and B Readers
KEY POINTS
Chest radiographs, also known as chest x-rays, are radiographic images taken of the chest.
Digital chest radiographs help diagnose conditions affecting the lungs and are used for medical screening and surveillance.
A B Reader is a physician trained and certified to classify chest x-ray findings of pneumoconiosis.
Overview
Chest radiography helps Identify workers with dust-induced lung diseases called pneumoconioses. Timely interventions to reduce or eliminate further dust exposure can lower disease progression.
A B Reader examining check x-rays.
B Readers classify radiographic images of workers exposed to mineral dust according to the International Labour Office (ILO) International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses

Chickenpox Vaccination
KEY POINTS
Two doses of the chickenpox vaccine are recommended for children by doctors as the best way to protect against chickenpox (varicella).
People who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get 2 doses.
Most people who get the vaccine will be protected for life and not get chickenpox.
Introduction
The best way to protect against chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe illness. Instead of MMRV, some children might receive separate vaccines for MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and varicella (chickenpox).
If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, called breakthrough chickenpox, the symptoms are usually mild. Vaccinated people often experience fewer to no blisters and low or no fever, but red spots may occur.

Impact of U.S. Chickenpox Vaccination Program
Available vaccines
There are two chickenpox vaccines licensed in the United States. The chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Your healthcare provider can give you more information.
Varivax®
Contains only chickenpox vaccine.
Is licensed for use in people 12 months or older.
Can be given to children for their routine 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at 12–15 months old and age 4–6 years old.
ProQuad®
Contains a combination of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines, which is also called MMRV.
Is only licensed for use in children 12 months–12 years old.
Recommendations
Children under 13 years old should get 2 doses.
12–15 months old
1st dose
4–6 years old
2nd dose
People 13 years and older who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get 2 doses. The doses should be at least 28 days apart. People should also get a second dose if they have had only one chickenpox dose. Instead of MMRV, some children might receive separate vaccines for MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and varicella.
After exposure to someone with chickenpox
Getting vaccinated after you are exposed to someone with chickenpox can:
Prevent the disease or make it less serious.
Protect you from chickenpox if you are exposed again in the future.
A healthcare provider can prescribe a medicine to make chickenpox less severe if you:
Are exposed to chickenpox.
Do not have immunity against the disease.
Are not eligible for vaccination.
Why getting vaccinated is important
Chickenpox is usually mild. However, it can be serious during pregnancy, in infants under 12 months old, adolescents, adults, and people with weakened immune systems.
Some people get so sick that they need to be hospitalized. It doesn’t happen often, but people can die from chickenpox. Most people who are vaccinated with 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine will be protected for life.
Chickenpox is a mild disease for many children, but not for all. There's no way to know who will have a serious case. With vaccination, your children get immunity from chickenpox without the risk of serious complications caused by the disease itself.
Who should get vaccinated
Everyone should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine if they have never had chickenpox or were never vaccinated.
Chickenpox vaccination is especially important for:
Healthcare professionals
Anyone who cares for or are near people with weakened immune systems
Residents and staff in nursing homes and other residential settings
Teachers, childcare workers, & anyone living with children
College students
Inmates and staff of correctional institutions
International travelers
Military personnel
Non-pregnant women of childbearing age
Who shouldn't get vaccinated
Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine, or they should wait. Check with your healthcare provider if you:
Have HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system.
Are being treated with drugs that affect the immune system for 2 weeks or more.
Have any kind of cancer.
Are getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs.
Recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products.
Are pregnant or may be pregnant.
The vaccine is safe and effective
The chickenpox vaccine is safe, and it is effective at protecting against chickenpox. Vaccines, like a medicine, can have side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own.
Two doses of the vaccine are about 90% effective at preventing chickenpox. When you get vaccinated, you protect yourself and others in your community, especially people who cannot get vaccinated. Since the chickenpox vaccination program began in the United States, there has been over 97% decrease in chickenpox cases. Hospitalizations and deaths have become rare.

Possible side effects
Most people don't have any side effects from the vaccine. The side effects that do occur are usually mild, and may include:
Soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given
Fever
Mild rash
Finding and paying for the vaccine
Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers.

Where to Find Vaccines
Vaccine costs
There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines:
Health insurance
Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children Program
Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines.

About Child Abuse and Neglect
KEY POINTS
Child abuse and neglect are serious public health problems.
Child abuse and neglect can have long-term impacts on health, opportunity, and well-being.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
What are child abuse and neglect?
Child abuse and neglect includes all types of abuse and neglect of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (e.g., a religious leader, a coach, or a teacher) that results in harm, the potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.
There are four common types of abuse and neglect:
Physical abuse is the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical injury. Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, or other shows of force against a child.
Sexual abuse refers to any completed or attempted sexual acts or sexual contact with a child by a caregiver. Examples include fondling, penetration, and exposing a child to other sexual activities. Read more information about child sexual abuse.
Emotional abuse refers to behaviors that harm a child's self-worth or emotional well-being. Examples include name-calling, shaming, rejecting, and withholding love.
Neglect is the failure to meet a child's basic physical and emotional needs. These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, access to medical care, and having feelings validated and appropriately responded to.1
For more information about child abuse and neglect definitions please see Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements [4.12 MB, 148 Pages, 508].
Quick facts and stats
Child abuse and neglect are common. At least one in seven children experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States.2 This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported. In 2021, 1,820 children died of abuse and neglect in the United States.3
Children living in poverty experience more abuse and neglect. Experiencing poverty can place a lot of stress on families, which may increase the risk for child abuse and neglect. Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for children in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher socioeconomic status.
Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime economic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in 2018.4 This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.5
Outcomes
Children who are abused or neglected may suffer immediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones. They may also have emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety or posttraumatic stress.
Over the long term, children who are abused or neglected are also at increased risk for experiencing future violence victimization and perpetration, substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, delayed brain development, lower educational attainment, and limited employment opportunities.
Abuse and neglect may result in toxic stress, which can change brain development and increase the risk for problems like posttraumatic stress disorder and learning, attention, and memory difficulties.6
Prevention
Child abuse and neglect can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing child abuse and neglect.
Preventing child abuse and neglect requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence.7
Everyone benefits when children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments. We all have role to play.

About Child Sexual Abuse
KEY POINTS
Child sexual abuse is a serious public health problem and an adverse childhood experience (ACE).
Child sexual abuse can have a long-term impact on health, opportunity, and well-being.
What is child sexual abuse?
Child sexual abuse refers to the involvement of a child (person less than 18 years old) in sexual activity that violates the laws or social taboos of society and that the child1:
Does not fully comprehend.
Does not consent to or is unable to give informed consent to.
Is not developmentally prepared for and cannot give consent to.
Quick facts and stats
Many children wait to report or never report child sexual abuse. Therefore, the numbers below likely underestimate the true impact of the problem. Although estimates vary across studies, the research shows:
At least one in four girls and one in 20 boys in the United States experience child sexual abuse.234
About 90% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone known and trusted by the child or child's family members. 5
The total lifetime economic burden of child sexual abuse in the United States in 2015 was estimated to be at least $9.3 billion.6
Outcomes
Experiencing child sexual abuse can affect how a person thinks, acts, and feels over a lifetime. This can result in short- and long-term physical, mental, and behavioral health consequences,7 such as...
Physical health consequences:
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs).8
Physical injuries.9
Chronic conditions later in life, such as heart disease, obesity, and cancer.10
Mental health consequences:
Depression.11
Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.11
Behavioral consequences:
Substance use/misuse, including opioid misuse.12
Risky sexual behaviors, meaning sex with multiple partners or behaviors that could result in pregnancy or STIs.1013
Increased risk for perpetration of sexual violence.1415
Increased risk for suicide or suicide attempts.16
Experiencing child sexual abuse can also increase a person’s risk for future victimization. For example, women who experienced child sexual abuse are at two to 13 times increased risk for experiencing sexual violence in adulthood.171819 Additionally, people who experienced child sexual abuse are at twice the risk for experiencing non-sexual intimate partner violence.20
Prevention
Child sexual abuse is preventable. Adults are responsible for ensuring that children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments. Resources for child sexual abuse have mostly focused on treatment for victims and criminal justice-oriented approaches for people who commit child sexual abuse. These efforts are important after child sexual abuse has occurred. However, little investment has been made in preventing child sexual abuse.
Until recently, there have been few effective evidence-based strategies available to proactively protect children from child sexual abuse. More resources are needed to develop, evaluate, disseminate, and implement evidence-based child sexual abuse primary prevention strategies. These strategies can help ensure that all children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments.
What CDC is doing
CDC surveillance systems, violence prevention initiatives, and efforts to support partners in the field have increased our understanding of child sexual abuse. However, there are still critical gaps.
Additional efforts in child sexual abuse prevention are needed to:
Improve surveillance systems and data collection for monitoring child sexual abuse.
Increase our understanding of risk and protective factors for child sexual abuse perpetration and victimization.
Strengthen existing and develop new evidence-based policies, programs, and practices for the primary prevention of child sexual abuse through rigorous evaluation research.
Increase dissemination and implementation of evidence-based strategies for child sexual abuse prevention.
CDC has developed Prevention Resources for Action, formerly known as ""technical packages,"" to help states and communities use the best available evidence to prevent various types of violence.
Since 2020, CDC has funded nine research cooperative agreements focused on the primary prevention of child sexual abuse. These research studies include both policy and program evaluations at the community, state, and national levels. These studies support the vision of a violence-free society in which all people and communities are safe, healthy, and thriving.

Childhood Arthritis
KEY POINTS
Childhood arthritis can cause pain, stiffness, joint or body swelling, and life-long damage to joints.
Symptoms may go away or continue into adulthood.
While there is no cure for childhood arthritis, there are ways to manage and treat it.
Overview
Arthritis that develops in children is called childhood arthritis (or juvenile arthritis).A1
Childhood arthritis begins when the immune system becomes overactive, leading to joint and body swelling.
Childhood arthritis can cause pain, loss of motion, and permanent damage in the joints.
This can make it hard for a child to walk, play, or dress themselves.
It can also result in disability.
Living with childhood arthritis
About 220,000 U.S. children under 18 have arthritis.1 Childhood arthritis is more common among certain groups in the United States, including children who are Black or African American and whose parents have lower levels of education.
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of childhood arthritis may be different for every child. They can include:
Joint pain.
Swelling.
Fever.
Stiffness.
Rash.
Feeling tired.
Loss of appetite.
There may be times when symptoms get worse, known as ""flares."" There may also be times when symptoms get better, known as ""remission.""
Causes
The causes of childhood arthritis are not known.
Who gets childhood arthritis
Any child can develop arthritis. But arthritis is more common in children who:1
Have anxiety or depression.
Have a heart condition.
Have overweight.
Are not physically active.
Live with people who smoke.
Diagnosis
Symptoms of childhood arthritis might seem like other illnesses and injuries.
A pediatric rheumatologist, who specializes in childhood arthritis, can help figure out the right diagnosis.
These doctors can diagnose childhood arthritis by doing:
A physical exam.
X-rays.
Lab tests.
A review of health history.
Find a childhood arthritis specialist near you
Visit the Arthritis Foundation for tips on finding a rheumatologist that best meets the needs of your child.
Management
To help manage arthritis, doctors may prescribe medicine and advise children to be physically active.
This may include exercises like those recommended by the Arthritis Foundation:
Water exercises (like shoulder shrugs and ankle circles).
Swimming.
Bicycling.
Tai chi.
Yoga.
Visit the Arthritis Foundation's Juvenile Arthritis web page for more information.
Physical activity benefits the health and well-being of children.
Treatment
There's no cure for childhood arthritis. But there are ways to treat it. Doctors can work with children and their parents or caregivers to develop a treatment plan.
Transitioning patients to adult care
Some children's arthritis improves as they age. Others may continue to have symptoms into adulthood.
Moving from child to adult care can be hard for those with arthritis. It can also be hard for their parents, caregivers, and health care providers.
The Arthritis Foundation has transition resources on how to:
Make appointments.
Understand health insurance.
Adjust to working or education beyond high school.

About Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention
KEY POINTS
There are no safe levels of lead in the blood.
Many children ingest lead dust by putting objects such as toys and dirt in their mouths.
The goal of CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) is to prevent childhood lead exposure before any harm occurs.
Overview
Lead is a naturally occurring metal that can cause negative health effects. People are exposed to lead by eating lead paint chips, ingesting contaminated food or water, and/or by breathing in lead dust.
Children younger than 6 years are more likely to be exposed due to their hand-to-mouth behavior. Many children ingest lead dust by putting objects such as toys and dirt in their mouths.
Lead in blood
No safe blood lead level (BLL) in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood are associated with developmental delays, difficulty learning, and behavioral issues. The effects of lead poisoning can be permanent and disabling.
There are steps that parents and healthcare providers can take to protect children from lead exposure. Healthcare providers can perform a blood lead test if a child was or may have been exposed to lead.
CDC uses a blood lead reference value (BLRV) of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL). This reference level helps identify children with BLLs higher than most children's levels. CDC estimates that approximately 500,000 children in the United States have BLLs at or above the BLRV. Healthcare providers can use CDC's Recommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Level to develop a plan of action for their patient. More information about sources of exposure, risk factors, testing and prevention is provided below.
Risk factors
Some children are at a greater risk for lead exposure from paint, water, soil, some imported items and industrial sources. They may also be exposed through their parents and caregivers from certain jobs and hobbies.
Keep Reading:
People at Increased Risk for Childhood Lead Poisoning
Causes
Children can be exposed to lead where they live, learn, and play. Sources of lead exposure can include the following:
Chipping or peeling paint in homes or buildings built before 1978
Water from lead pipes
Soil near airports, highways, or factories
Some imported candies and traditional medicines
Some imported toys and jewelry
Certain jobs and hobbies
Older homes and buildings may be painted with lead-based paint.
Prevention
The goal of CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) is to prevent childhood lead exposure before any harm occurs. Through CLPPP, CDC supports state and local public health departments with funds for surveillance and prevention of lead exposure.
Testing
A blood lead test is the best way to determine if a child has been exposed to lead. Parents can talk to their healthcare provider to find out if a blood lead test is needed. Healthcare providers can recommend follow-up actions and care based on the child's BLL.
To find out if a home has lead, hire a certified lead inspector to test for lead. Visit the Environmental Protection Agency's Lead Abatement, Inspection and Risk Assessment
web page to locate one. Renters can ask their landlord to have the home inspected or to share results of recently conducted lead inspections.

Preventing Childhood Obesity: 6 Things Families Can Do
KEY POINTS
Childhood obesity is a complex disease with many contributing factors, including genetics, eating patterns, physical activity levels, and sleep routines. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and other health issues. Although there is no one solution, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits.
Why it matters
About 1 in 5 American children have obesity. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure.
Obesity also has an impact on medical costs. Compared to children with healthy weight, total medical expenditures for children with severe obesity are $909 higher each year.
Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for stroke, many types of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death, and mental illness, such as clinical depression and anxiety.
Factors that influence obesity include genetics, eating patterns, physical activity levels, access to health care, and sleep routines. Also, conditions where we live, learn, work, and play can make healthy eating and getting enough physical activity difficult.
Though there is no one solution to addressing obesity, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits at home.
Here are ways families can help prevent obesity.
1. Model a healthy eating pattern
Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are often less expensive than fresh and are still good for you. Look for low sodium or no salt added vegetables and fruits packed in 100% fruit juice.
Adopting healthy eating patterns as a family helps children reach and maintain a healthy weight as they age. Eating a variety of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, lean protein foods, and low-fat and fat-free dairy products follows nutrition guidelines
and sets children and adults up for optimal health.
Help kids rethink their drink by replacing sugary drinks, such as soda, fruit drinks, and flavored milk, with water, 100% juice, or plain low-fat milk.
Hunger Hotline
For information about meal sites, food banks, and other services near you, call 1-866-3-HUNGRY (or 1-877-8-HAMBRE for Spanish).
Hours: 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET, Monday – Friday.
2. Move more as a family
Physically active youth have stronger muscles and bones, better cardiovascular fitness, and lower body fat than those who are inactive. Children aged 3–5 years should be physically active throughout the day. Children aged 6–17 years need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.
Help your children move more
and meet the physical activity recommendations by making it a family affair. Walking the family pet before and after school, riding bikes, and having races in the yard all count toward physical activity. Active chores, such as washing the car, vacuuming a room, or raking leaves, also count.
3. Set consistent sleep routines
Good sleep helps prevent type 2 diabetes, obesity, injuries, and problems with attention and behavior. Children who don't get enough sleep are at risk for unhealthy weight gain. Researchers are still trying to learn how sleep is linked to weight gain. Some reasons might include that lack of sleep can cause a child to eat more or to be less physically active because of to lack of energy.
Preschoolers need 10–13 hours of sleep per day, including naps. Children 6–12 years old need 9–12 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night, and youth 13–17 need 8–10 hours. Staying with a consistent sleep schedule, including on weekends, can help children sleep better.

4. Replace screen time with family time
During childhood, too much screen time can lead to poor sleep, weight gain, lower grades in school, and poor mental health. Reducing screen time can free up time for family activities and can remove cues to eat unhealthy food.
Turning off screens an hour before bed and removing screens from children's bedrooms can help reduce screen time and improve sleep. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends creating a family media plan
with examples of ways to reduce screen time.
5. Support obesity prevention in Early Care and Education
About 3 in 5 children birth through age 5 who are not yet in kindergarten are in a nonparental care arrangement at least once a week. The number of children in Early care and education (ECE) settings makes them among the best places outside the home to help young children build a foundation for healthy living. High-quality ECE programming can have a positive impact on a child's social-emotional wellbeing, educational achievement, health, and socioeconomic outcomes later in life.
Look for ECE settings supporting healthy infant feeding, healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time limits. When looking for ECE programs for your child, ask about policies and practices related to breastfeeding and feeding breast milk to infants, nutrition standards for the food served, access to outdoor physical activity during the day, and how much time the child will spend daily in front of a screen.
6. Find a Family Healthy Weight Program
If you are concerned about your child's weight, talk with their health care provider. They can assess the health risks related to excess weight. If your child has overweight or obesity, your health care provider may refer you to a family healthy weight program (FHWP). FHWPs are comprehensive, family-based lifestyle change programs to help children who are overweight or who have obesity make progress toward a healthier weight through positive behavior changes.

About Chlamydia
KEY POINTS
Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can be treated.
People who are sexually active can get chlamydia.
This fact sheet answers basic questions about chlamydia.
Overview
What is chlamydia?
Chlamydia is a common STI that can cause infection among men and women. It can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system. This can make it difficult or impossible to get pregnant later. Chlamydia can also cause a potentially fatal ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy that occurs outside the womb).
Signs and symptoms
How do I know if I have chlamydia?
Chlamydia often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms.
Chlamydia often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may not appear until several weeks after having sex with a partner who has chlamydia.
Symptoms in women
Even when chlamydia has no symptoms, it can damage a woman's reproductive system. Women with symptoms may notice:
An abnormal vaginal discharge
A burning sensation when peeing
Symptoms in men
Men with symptoms may notice:
Penis discharge
A burning sensation when peeing
Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common)
Symptoms from rectal infections
Men and women can also get chlamydia in their rectum. This happens either by having receptive anal sex, or by spread from another infected site (such as the vagina). While these infections often cause no symptoms, they can cause:
Rectal pain
Discharge
Bleeding
See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly discharge, burning when peeing, and bleeding between periods.
Risk factors
Am I at risk for chlamydia?
Sexually active people can get chlamydia through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with a partner who has chlamydia.
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for chlamydia or other STIs.
How it spreads
How is chlamydia spread?
You can get chlamydia by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with someone who has the infection. A pregnant woman with chlamydia can give the infection to her baby during childbirth.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of getting chlamydia?
The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, the following things can lower your chances of getting chlamydia:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have chlamydia
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex
I'm pregnant. If I have chlamydia, how can I protect my baby from getting it?
If you are pregnant and have chlamydia, you can give the infection to your baby during delivery. This can cause serious health problems for your baby. If you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about getting the correct examination, testing, and treatment. Treating chlamydia as soon as possible will make health problems for your baby less likely.
Testing and diagnosis
Should I be tested for chlamydia?
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for chlamydia or other STIs.
If you are a sexually active gay or bisexual man, you should get tested for chlamydia every year. If you are a sexually active woman, you should get tested for chlamydia every year if you are:
Younger than 25 years
25 years and older with risk factors, such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection
Testing is also recommended during pregnancy in some cases.
How will my healthcare provider know if I have chlamydia?
Laboratory tests can diagnose chlamydia. Your healthcare provider may ask you to provide a urine sample for testing, or they might use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a vaginal sample.
Treatment and recovery
Is there a cure for chlamydia?
Yes, the right treatment can cure chlamydia. It is important that you take all of the medicine your healthcare provider gives you to cure your infection. Do not share medicine for chlamydia with anyone. When taken properly it will stop the infection and could decrease your chances of having problems later. Although medicine will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease.
Repeat infection with chlamydia is common. You should receive testing again about three months after your treatment, even if your sex partner(s) receives treatment.
When can I have sex again after my chlamydia treatment?
You should not have sex again until you and your sex partner(s) complete treatment. If given a single dose of medicine, you should wait seven days after taking the medicine before having sex. If given medicine to take for seven days, wait until you finish all the doses before having sex.
If you've had chlamydia and took medicine in the past, you can still get it again. This can happen if you have sex without a condom with a person who has chlamydia.
What happens if I don't get treated?
The initial damage that chlamydia causes often goes unnoticed. However, chlamydia can lead to serious health problems.
In women, untreated chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are:
Formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes
Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the womb
)
Infertility (not being able to get pregnant)
Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain
Men rarely have health problems from chlamydia. The infection can cause a fever and pain in the tubes attached to the testicles. This can, in rare cases, lead to infertility.
Untreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV.

Chlorine
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Chlorine is a liquid or gas with a strong, irritating smell.
Signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure depend on how you were exposed.
Get away from the area, get clean, and get help if exposed.
Chlorine can explode with many common substances.
Overview
Chlorine is a chemical element commonly used in some jobs and is found in some household products, like bleach.
Chlorine has the following traits:
Yellow-green gas under normal conditions
Smells like bleach
Dissolvable in water
Liquid when pressurized and kept cool
Chlorine is turned into a liquid for storage and transport. When liquid chlorine is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground and spreads quickly.
Warning!
Chlorine can explode or create explosive products with many common substances. They include: acetylene, ether, turpentine, ammonia, fuel gas, hydrogen, and finely divided metals.
Signs and symptoms
Most people will smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to chlorine. Exposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical. Some people with asthma or other lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing chlorine than others.
Effects depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were exposed for.
When chlorine gas touches moist tissues (like the eyes, throat, and lungs) it creates an acid that can hurt these tissues.
If high amounts are breathed in, breathing problems may show up right away. Symptoms of exposure to higher levels of chlorine include the following:
Blurred vision or eye tearing
Burning feeling in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes
Coughing and/or coughing up white to pink-colored fluid
Chest tightness
Breathing problems, shortness of breath, or rapid and shallow breathing
Respiratory failure (too much carbon dioxide in your body)
Frostbite if exposed to liquid chlorine
Nausea and/or vomiting
Skin pain, redness, and/or blisters
If low amounts are breathed in, symptoms may show up later.
Exposure
Warning!
Household chlorine bleach can release chlorine gas if it is mixed with certain other cleaning products. Do not mix household cleaners!
If chlorine is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the chlorine gas. If chlorine is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains chlorine.
Because chlorine gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there.
Chlorine in food
Chlorine is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and taste. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched liquid chlorine if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by chlorine. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the chlorine was released and breathe fresh air.
Outdoors
If the chlorine release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the chlorine does not come inside.
If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the chlorine was released.
Indoors
If the chlorine release was indoors, get out of the building. If the chlorine release was from household cleaners or chemicals, open windows and doors to let in fresh air. Leave the area until the gas has gone away.
If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible because chlorine is heavier than air and will sink.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering as soon as you can. Showering is the best method for removing chlorine from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take your clothes off
If clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes.
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the chlorine from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. Drop clothes to the floor.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
Wash your body
Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet, including armpits and groin, with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap for several minutes. Finish with a plain water rinse. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid through. Gather all used things from the floor and put them in a plastic bag, close it up, and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch chlorine. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.
Get help
Get help right away by calling 911, going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave your home, or calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.
Treatment
If someone has swallowed chlorine, do not force vomiting.
No known cure exists for chlorine exposure.
Treatment involves removing chlorine from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel.
Long-term health effects
Short exposure
Lung health usually returns to normal within 7 to 14 days. Although most people recover completely, symptoms and lung issues may continue for those more seriously exposed. Exposure to chlorine can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), asthma caused by chemicals.
Long term exposure
This often occurs in the workplace. Teeth may be weakened. Multiple exposures to chlorine may also produce flu-like symptoms and high risk of RADS.

Riot Control Agents
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that cause irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Several different compounds are riot control agents:
Chloroacetophenone (CN)
Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS)
Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant
Bromobenzylcyanide (CA)
Dibenzoxazepine (CR)
Combinations of various agents.
Where it is found
Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray).
CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks.
How it works
Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure.
The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off.
Signs and symptoms
The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors).
People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure:
Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness
Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling
Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling
Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath
Skin: burns, rash
Other: nausea and vomiting
Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as:
Blindness
Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess
Immediate death due to severe chemical burns to the throat and lungs
Respiratory failure possibly resulting in death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to riot control agents.
Exposure
Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles.
If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in.
What to do if you are exposed
Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents.
If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground.
If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe.
Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes.
Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages.
No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents.
Long-term health effects
Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following:
Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness)
Eye scarring
Cataracts
Breathing problems, such as asthma
These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors.
If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

Riot Control Agents
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that cause irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Several different compounds are riot control agents:
Chloroacetophenone (CN)
Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS)
Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant
Bromobenzylcyanide (CA)
Dibenzoxazepine (CR)
Combinations of various agents.
Where it is found
Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray).
CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks.
How it works
Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure.
The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off.
Signs and symptoms
The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors).
People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure:
Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness
Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling
Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling
Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath
Skin: burns, rash
Other: nausea and vomiting
Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as:
Blindness
Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess
Immediate death due to severe chemical burns to the throat and lungs
Respiratory failure possibly resulting in death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to riot control agents.
Exposure
Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles.
If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in.
What to do if you are exposed
Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents.
If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground.
If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe.
Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes.
Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages.
No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents.
Long-term health effects
Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following:
Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness)
Eye scarring
Cataracts
Breathing problems, such as asthma
These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors.
If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

MAY 12, 2024
About Cholera
KEY POINTS
Cholera is a bacterial disease spread through contaminated water and food.
Cholera can cause severe diarrhea, dehydration, and even death if the disease goes untreated.
People living in places with unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene are at highest risk of cholera.
What it is
Cholera is an infection of the intestines caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. You can get cholera from drinking water or eating food containing cholera bacteria.
Most people who get cholera don't get sick. However, cholera can cause life-threatening watery diarrhea and vomiting. Every year, an estimated 1.3 to 4 million people around the world get cholera, and between 21,000 to 143,000 people die.
With early and proper treatment, even severely ill patients can survive cholera.
Signs and symptoms
Most people who get cholera have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. About 1 in 10 people develop severe symptoms such as watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Losing body fluids quickly can lead to dehydration and shock.

Signs and Symptoms of Cholera
Who is at risk
People living in areas with unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene are at highest risk of getting cholera.
U.S. residents can get cholera while traveling abroad and sometimes become ill after returning home. Some travelers have gotten sick after bringing contaminated seafood home with them from abroad.

About Cholera in the United States
How it spreads
People usually get cholera from drinking water or eating food that contains traces of poop from someone with cholera. The disease can spread quickly in areas where sewage and drinking water aren't adequately treated.
Cholera bacteria also can live in brackish (slightly salty) and coastal waters. Eating raw shellfish can cause cholera.
Cholera is not likely to spread from person to person or from casual contact with someone with cholera.

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
MAY 10, 2024
ME/CFS Basics
KEY POINTS
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious and often long-lasting illness that keeps people from doing their usual activities.
It makes physical and mental exertion difficult.
Symptoms include trouble thinking, severe tiredness and other symptoms.
There is no known cause or cure. Care usually means treating the symptoms that most affect a person's life.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
ME/CFS is a biological illness that affects many body parts. It causes severe fatigue not improved by rest, problems thinking and sleeping, dizziness, pain, and many other symptoms.
People with ME/CFS may not look sick but can't do their normal activities. ME/CFS may get worse after they do any activity -- physical or mental. This symptom is called post-exertional malaise (PEM). After they exert themselves, they may need to stay in bed for an extended time. About 1 in 4 people with ME/CFS are confined to bed at some point in their illness.
Did you know?
It's estimated that up to 3.3 million people in the United States suffer from ME/CFS. More than 9 in 10 people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed by a doctor. ME/CFS costs the U.S. economy about $18 to $51 billion annually in medical costs and lost income.
It is difficult to diagnose because there is no specific test for ME/CFS. One reason that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed may be limited access to healthcare. Another reason may be a lack of healthcare providers who know about ME/CFS and how to recognize it.
Anyone can get ME/CFS. It doesn't matter what age, gender or ethnicity they are. However, some groups are more affected than others.
Signs and symptoms
People with ME/CFS are not able to function the same way they did before they became ill. They may not always be able to do daily tasks like showering or cooking a meal.
ME/CFS often makes it hard to keep a job, go to school, and take part in family and social life. ME/CFS can last for years and sometimes leads to serious disability.
ME/CFS is most common in people in middle age but also affects kids, teens and elderly people. Among adults, women are affected more often than men. Among children, teens are more affected than younger kids.
People who are white are diagnosed more often than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, especially among people from racial and ethnic minority groups.
Diagnosis
Symptoms of ME/CFS may appear similar to many other illnesses. There is no test to confirm ME/CFS. This makes it difficult to diagnose. The illness can also be unpredictable. Symptoms may come and go, or there may be changes in how severe symptoms are over time.
A doctor should be able to distinguish ME/CFS from other illnesses by doing a thorough medical exam. This includes asking many questions about the patient's health history and current illness. They should also ask about how often symptoms occur, how bad they are, and how long they have lasted. It is also important for doctors to talk with patients about how the symptoms affect their lives.
Treatment and recovery
There is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS. But some symptoms can be treated or managed. Treating these symptoms might provide relief for some people with ME/CFS but not others. Other strategies, like learning new ways to manage activity, can also help.
People with ME/CFS, their families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom causes the most problems. This should be treated first after discussing possible benefits and harms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies.
Healthcare providers need to support their patients' families as they come to understand how to live with this illness. Providers and families should remember that this process is likely to be hard on people with ME/CFS.

MAY 15, 2024
  About COPD
KEY POINTS
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prevents airflow to the lungs, causing breathing problems.
It is a leading cause of death in the United States.
Smoking is the main cause of COPD, but nonsmokers can get it.
Talk with your doctor if you have COPD symptoms or previously smoked.
What it is
COPD is a group of lung diseases that get worse over time.
The most common COPD types are emphysema
and chronic bronchitis
.
There is no cure for COPD, but it can be treated.
Nearly 16 million U.S. adults have COPD,1and many more do not know they have it.2
Symptoms
Common signs and symptoms include:
Frequent coughing or wheezing.
Shortness of breath doing everyday activities.
Trouble taking deep breaths.
Excess phlegm or mucus.
Complications
COPD is 1 of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.34
People with COPD are more likely to have difficulty:1
Working or doing usual activities.
Walking or climbing stairs.
Concentrating, remembering, or making decisions.
They are also more likely to have:
Other chronic diseases like asthma, heart disease, and diabetes.
Depression or mental health condition.
Reported poor health.
Causes and risk factors
Tobacco smoke is the main cause of COPD in the United States.5
Risk factors
Anyone who smokes or used to smoke cigarettes has a higher risk of developing COPD.
Other risk factors include:
Secondhand smoke.
Exposure to environmental or workplace breathing hazards.
Family history of COPD.
Asthma.
Reducing risk
To lower your risk of COPD:
Stop smoking.
Avoid inhaling cigarette smoke.

Some of these symptoms are well-recognized and specific to the type of infection, for example, loss of smell and COVID-19. Other symptoms are unexplained and general (e.g., fatigue or difficulty thinking). Similar symptoms can follow many different types of infections.
Some disease agents that have been linked to chronic symptoms
(In alphabetical order)
Borrelia burgdorferi (bacteria causing Lyme disease)
Campylobacter
Chikungunya virus
Coxiella burnetii (bacteria causing Q fever)
Dengue virus
Ebola virus
Epstein Barr virus
Enterovirus
Poliovirus
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
West Nile virus
Some people with chronic symptoms following infections may not know which infection triggered the symptoms, or even recognize that they had an infection before their chronic symptoms began. People with chronic symptoms and unknown preceding infection may be diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.
How it affects your body
General symptoms can include:
Tiredness or fatigue that interferes with daily life
""Flu-like"" symptoms including, muscle pain, headache, sweating, irritability, and general feelings of sickness
Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental effort (also known as ""post-exertional malaise"")
Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as ""brain fog""), trouble finding words
Chronic or recurrent joint pain
Sleep problems
Causes
It is not fully known why some people experience chronic general symptoms.

What Causes Chronic Symptoms Following Infections
Living with chronic symptoms
The type, duration, and intensity of chronic symptoms following an infection can be different from person to person. Symptoms may come and go or vary in severity (how bad the person feels over time). Some patients’ symptoms slowly improve with time. However, it can take weeks and sometimes years to feel well. The longer fatigue or other symptoms last, the more likely they are to lead to other problems, such as physical weakness or difficulty with performing daily activities. Long-term illnesses can also impact relationships and a person’s mental health.
It is important to talk to a healthcare provider if you are concerned about any symptoms that last a long time.
Keep Reading:
Talking with a Healthcare Provider about Chronic Symptoms
Treatment and recovery
In many cases, there are no specific treatments or cures for chronic symptoms following an infection. There are, however, steps you can take to reduce the impact these symptoms have on your life. Given the overlap in symptoms, management and treatment approaches for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) can be helpful for people experiencing chronic symptoms.
More information on how to treat chronic symptoms following a specific infection may be available at the above disease agent links.
What CDC is doing
Many infections can result in chronic general symptoms that look similar to ME/CFS. CDC believes that by looking across the infections known to cause chronic symptoms, we can learn more about how often and why they occur, as well as how to diagnose and treat them. This year, CDC is:
Funding studies to learn more about how to recognize and treat patients who experience chronic symptoms after an infection
Meeting with experts to prioritize research activities
and improve guidance for clinicians
Increasing awareness
among healthcare providers and the public
Monitoring the occurrence of chronic symptoms following certain infections
Working with patient partner organizations to understand the needs and priorities of people with chronic symptoms following infection

Facts About TBI
KEY POINTS
A TBI affects how the brain works.
TBI is a major cause of death and disability.
TBIs may be missed in older adults.
A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems.
A TBI during childhood may affect brain development.
What it is
A TBI affects how the brain works
Doctor examines a brain using modern technology.
A traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is an injury that affects how the brain works. It may be caused by a:
Bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or
Penetrating injury (such as from a gunshot) to the head
There are three main types of TBI:
Mild TBI or concussion
Moderate TBI
Severe TBI
TBI is a major cause of death and disability
There were over 69,000 TBI-related deaths in the United States in 2021.1 That's about 190 TBI-related deaths every day.
TBIs affect the lives of people of all ages. Anyone can experience a TBI, but data suggest that some groups are at greater risk of dying from a TBI or experiencing long-term health problems after the injury.2 Examples of groups who are more likely to be affected by TBI, include:
Racial and ethnic minorities3
Service members and veterans4
People who experience homelessness5
People who are in correctional and detention facilities6
Survivors of intimate partner violence7
People living in rural areas8
Learn more about health disparities and TBI.
How TBIs happen
People most commonly get TBIs from a fall, firearm-related injury, motor vehicle crash, or an assault.
Research shows that:
Falls lead to nearly half of the TBI-related hospitalizations.9
Firearm-related suicide is the most common cause of TBI-related deaths in the United States.310
Motor vehicle crashes and assaults are other common ways a person may get a TBI.9
For more detailed information on the leading ways people get TBIs and the groups of people most likely to get a TBI, check out CDC's TBI data reports.
Populations
TBIs may be missed in older adults
Older adults are more likely to be hospitalized and die from a TBI compared to all other age groups.9 Still, TBIs may be missed or misdiagnosed in older adults because symptoms of TBI overlap with other medical conditions that are more common among older adults, such as dementia.
Healthcare providers should check for signs and symptoms of TBI if an older adult has:
Fallen or has a fall-related injury, such as a hip fracture.
Been in a car crash.
This is especially important among older adults who are taking blood thinners,11 such as:
Anticoagulants like warfarin (Coumadin), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis).
Antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), and acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin).
These medicines may increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following a TBI.11 Bleeding in the brain after a TBI may put a person at risk for more severe injury or death.
Potential effects of TBIs
A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems
Depending on the severity of the injury, those who get a TBI may face health problems that last a few days or the rest of their lives. For example, a person with a mild TBI or concussion may experience short-term symptoms and feel better within a couple of weeks or months. And a person with a moderate or severe TBI may have long-term or life-long effects from the injury.
A person with a possible TBI should be seen by a healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may have treatment to help speed your recovery.
Most people with a mild TBI or concussion can recover safely at home following a medical check-up.
People with a moderate or severe TBI may need ongoing care, such as rehabilitation services, to help with their recovery.
A TBI during childhood may affect brain development
TBI affects children differently than adults. An injury of any severity to the developing brain may:
Disrupt a child's development.
Limit their ability to participate in school and other activities, like sports.
As a result of a TBI, children may experience changes in their health, thinking, and behavior that affect learning, self-regulation, and social participation, all of which are important to becoming a productive adult.12
CDC's Report to Congress on the management of traumatic brain injury in children details the potential effects of a TBI on children and their families.12

About Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD)
KEY POINTS
Chronic wasting disease affects deer, elk and similar animals in the United States and a few other countries.
The disease hasn't been shown to infect people.
However, it might be a risk to people if they have contact with or eat meat from animals infected with CWD.
Overview
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, moose and similar animals. It has been reported in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, Sweden and South Korea.
No CWD infections in people have ever been reported. And it's not known if people can even get infected with CWD. However, CWD is related to another prion disease in animals that does infect people. So, it is considered a theoretical risk to people.
Some studies in monkeys suggest they can get CWD by eating meat or brain tissues of infected deer or elk. These studies raise concerns CWD may also pose a risk to people.
Exposure risks
In the United States, CWD was first identified in the 1960s in captive deer. In 1981, the first wild deer with CWD was reported. Since then, the disease has been reported in wild deer in more than half of U.S. states. It's possible that CWD is also in other states but hasn't been reported yet. Once the disease is established in an area, the CWD prions can stay in the environment (soil) for years.
If CWD could spread to people, it would most likely be by eating meat from an infected animal. A CDC survey
of U.S. residents showed nearly 1 in 5 said they had hunted deer or elk. More than 6 in 10 said they had eaten venison or elk meat. These groups would likely be most at risk if CWD spreads to people.
Causes
Chronic wasting disease is a type of prion disease. Prions are proteins that are normally found in the body. In rare cases, the proteins misfold, causing serious symptoms in the animal or person affected. Once a person or animal gets sick, the disease moves to the brain and spine and eventually leads to death.
Scientists believe CWD proteins (prions) spread between animals through body fluids like feces, saliva, blood, or urine. This can occur either through direct contact or indirectly through contamination of soil, food or water.
Reducing risk
When hunting in areas with CWD activity, follow these steps to reduce your risk of contact with the disease:
Do not shoot, handle or eat animals that look sick or act strangely.
Do not touch or eat meat from animals found dead (roadkill)
When field-dressing a deer or handling meat:
Wear latex or rubber gloves
Avoid handling its internal organs, especially the brain or spine.
Do not use knives or other tools you use in your kitchen.
Check state wildlife and health department recommendations before you hunt. See if they recommend or require testing animals for CWD is the hunting area. Recommendations vary by state.
Strongly consider having the deer or elk tested for CWD before you eat the meat. If your deer is processed commercially, consider asking to have your animal be processed individually. This ensures you are only getting meat from your animal. If your animal tests positive for CWD, do not eat meat from that animal.
What CDC is doing
CDC has been working with health officials in states where CWD has been reported for decades. We are collaborating to watch for potential CWD cases in people. By surveying hunters' health in states with long CWD histories, we hope to have early warnings if it spreads to people.

Symptoms of Illnesses Caused by Saltwater Harmful Algal Blooms
KEY POINTS
Algae that grow in salt water and produce toxins (poisons) can make people and animals sick.
You can get sick by eating seafood, going in water, or breathing in sea spray containing these toxins.
Symptoms can be mild to life-threatening, depending on the amount and type of toxin.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms caused by harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays, vary depending on the type of harmful algal bloom toxin.
Serious symptoms are most often caused by eating seafood containing harmful algal bloom toxins. Going in water with a harmful algal bloom or breathing in sea spray may cause more mild symptoms.
If you think a harmful algal bloom made you sick, contact a healthcare provider or the Poison Control hotline
at 1-800-222-1222. They can give you advice about how to feel better.
Karenia brevis red tide
Red tides in the Gulf of Mexico are one of the most widely known harmful algal blooms in the United States. These blooms are caused by the algae Karenia brevis, which makes a toxin called brevetoxin.
Breathing in sea spray or getting water on your skin during these red tides can cause symptoms including:
Coughing or sneezing

Signs and symptoms in animals
Animals can be poisoned by swimming in or swallowing water with a harmful algal bloom. They can also be poisoned by eating algae, fish, or shellfish containing toxins. Harmful algal bloom toxins can build up in fish through larger fish eating smaller fish.
Animals can get seriously sick or die within hours to days of contact with harmful algal blooms or their toxins. Harmful algal blooms can cause widespread death among animals that live in or near bodies of salt water, such as oceans.
Mammals
Dolphins and Indian manatees can be poisoned by red tides in the Gulf of Mexico. The toxin (brevetoxin) made by these red tides can damage a manatee's lungs, in some cases causing them to die. Large numbers of poisoned dolphins sometimes get stranded on beaches.
California sea lions can be poisoned by a harmful algal bloom toxin called domoic acid. This toxin can damage their nervous systems, causing them to have seizures or behave strangely.
Birds
Birds can get sick and die after eating algae, fish, or shellfish containing harmful algal bloom toxins. For example, pelicans and cormorants can be poisoned. In some cases, thousands of birds may die.

Harmful Algal Blooms and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Harmful algal blooms are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria in water that can harm people, animals, or the environment.
Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick.
Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad.
Overview
Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or ""bloom."" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick.
What they look like
Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see.
A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red.
Keep Reading:
How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom
When they're harmful
Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they:
Make toxins
Become too dense
Use up oxygen in the water
Release harmful gases
Types
Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick.
Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers.
Dinoflagellates or diatoms are the most common causes of harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays.

Types of Harmful Algal Blooms
Where they're found
Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or brackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for recreation and for drinking.
Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United States, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
What causes them
Algae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a harmful algal bloom when water is:
Warm
Slow-moving
Full of nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorous
Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or runoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans. This can happen during rainstorms, for example.
Environmental changes, such as warmer water, might be making harmful algal blooms worse.
Learn more about factors that help harmful algal blooms grow.
Health impacts
Harmful algal blooms cause a variety of mild to serious illnesses. Symptoms depend on the type of harmful algal bloom you come in contact with and how you are exposed.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
Harmful agal blooms can be deadly for animals
Contact a veterinarian immediately if your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water. Animals can get very sick or even die within hours of coming into contact with harmful algae or cyanobacteria. Learn more about protecting pets and livestock.
Risk of exposure
People and animals can get sick from having contact with water or food that contains certain types of algae, cyanobacteria, or their toxins.
You or your animals can get sick if you:
Go in or near water contaminated by a harmful algal bloom
Swallow contaminated water
Eat contaminated shellfish or fish
Use contaminated blue-green algae dietary supplements
Keep Reading:
How People and Animals Get Sick From Harmful Algal Blooms
Preventing exposure
You can take steps to avoid getting sick from harmful algal blooms. For example:
Stay out of discolored, scummy, or smelly water and keep pets away.
Check for and follow swimming, fishing, and shellfish advisories.
Follow guidance from local officials if there is a harmful algal bloom in your drinking water supply.

About Bed Bugs
WHAT TO KNOW
Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people.
Bites can cause itching, loss of sleep, and, rarely, allergic reactions.
Prevent bed bugs by regularly looking for signs of infestation.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Bed bugs (Cimex species) are small, flat insects. Bed bugs bite people and animals at night while they sleep, feeding on their blood.
Bed bugs are reddish-brown in color, are wingless, and range from 1mm to 7mm in size (roughly the size of Lincoln's head on a penny). They can live several months without a blood meal.
Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people. However, they cause irritation, itching, and loss off sleep. Removal from dwellings can be expensive and inconvenient to remove.
Where you can find bed bugs
You can find bed bugs anywhere, from North and South America, to Africa, Asia, and Europe. Bed bugs are in five-star hotels and resorts. How clean a place is does not determine whether bed bugs are present.
Signs and symptoms
Although bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people, they can cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes intense itching can lead to excessive scratching and possibly a secondary skin infection. An allergic reaction to several bites is possible. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider.
How to tell if you've been bitten
Bed bug bites affect each person differently. Signs of a bed bug bites include
No physical signs
Small bite marks
Serious allergic reactions (rare).
When bed bugs bite, they inject fluids (anesthetic and anticoagulant) that prevents a person from feeling the bite when it happens. Most people do not notice the bite marks until they appear from one to several days after the initial bite.
Bites look similar to mosquito or flea bites—a slightly swollen and red area that may itch and be irritating. The bite marks may be random or appear in a straight line.
Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems that arise from intense scratching of the bites.
Allergic reactions are possible
Allergic symptoms can include enlarged bite marks, painful swellings at the bite site, and, on rare occasions, anaphylaxis. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider.
Exposure risks
Everyone is at risk for getting bed bugs when visiting an infested area. However, you are at higher risk of getting bed bugs if you travel frequently and share living and sleeping space where other people have previously slept.
Causes and spread
Bed bugs are experts at hiding. Their slim flat bodies allow them to fit into very small spaces. They can go long periods of time without a blood meal.
Bed bugs spread by getting into the seams and folds of luggage, overnight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else they can hide. Most people do not realize they are transporting bed bugs and infecting areas as they travel.
Resource
DPDx - Bed Bug life cycle
Reducing risk
Early detection and eradication of bed bugs can make infestations easier to control. For those that travel, it may be helpful to look for signs of infestation, such as exoskeletons or bed bugs in folds of mattresses and sheets, in sleeping areas.
Where to look for bed bugs
Bed bug infestations usually happen around or near areas where people sleep. This includes apartments, shelters, houses, hotels, cruise ships, buses, trains, and dorm rooms.
The bugs hide during the day in places on or around the bed. They can hide in
The seams of mattresses
Box springs
Bed frames and headboards
Dresser tables
Inside cracks or crevices
Behind wallpaper
Bed bugs can travel over 100 feet in a night but tend to live within 8 feet of where people sleep.
Signs of an infestation
One of the easiest ways to identify a bed bug infestation is by bite marks on the face, neck, arms, hands, or any other body parts after sleeping. However, these bite marks may take as long as 14 days to develop in some people. It's important to look for other clues to determine if you have an infestation.
Look for
Exoskeletons (shed after molting),
Bed bugs in the fold of mattresses and sheets,
Rusty–colored blood spots on mattresses or nearby furniture, and
A sweet musty odor.
Treatment
Treating bites
Bed bug bites can cause inflammatory reactions in some people, but usually do not require medical treatment. The best way to treat a bite is to apply antiseptic creams or lotions to help with itching and to avoid scratching the area (to prevent secondary infections). For people with itchy inflammatory reactions, an antihistamine may help control the itching.
Treating infestations
If you think you have a bed bug infestation, contact a professional pest control company experienced with treating bed bugs. They will typically spray insecticides to treat the area.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
MAY 13, 2024
Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
WHAT TO KNOW
Classic CJD is a quick-moving, always fatal disease that occurs worldwide.
It affects the brain and causes dementia and other problems.
CJD mostly occurs in older adults.
There is no treatment or cure.
It usually leads to death within a year from when symptoms begin.
Overview
CJD is caused by a prion, a type of infectious protein. Prions trigger normal proteins in the body to misfold, leading to CJD.
CJD causes dementia and other neurologic problems. Once symptoms begin, it can lead to death in months to a year.
Classic CJD occurs worldwide in older adults, with the average age in the late 60s. Very few cases occur in people who are younger than 30 years old.
CJD occurs worldwide with an estimated rate of about one to two illness per one million population members per year. In recent years in the United States, about 500-600 cases have been reported per year.
Types
There are three main types of CJD infection:
Sporadic
The vast majority of all CJD cases reported (about 85 percent) are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the body misfold for some unknown reason. The result is disease that breaks down the brain's functions. Some cases are fatal within a few months of the first symptoms, and most are fatal within a year.
Familial
About 5-15 percent of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited a mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) who also has the disease would have familial CJD.
Iatrogenic
Iatrogenic cases are caused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or due to biological products. There have been six known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with prions is used on another patient.
People who received prion-contaminated human growth hormone prior to 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still being identified.
Finally, cases can occur in people who receive a transplant of specific materials. These include corneal (eye) grafts or dura mater (a membrane in the brain and spinal cord) grafts. If the donor had CJD that was not discovered before the donation, recipients can contract CJD.
How it affects your body
People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may include trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients usually die within one year following the onset of symptoms.
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers can diagnose an illness as a suspect case based on:
Symptoms and course of illness
Tests of a person's spinal fluid
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a brain scan
EEG, a test of electrical activity in the brain.
The only way to confirm CJD is through testing brain tissue from a biopsy or an autopsy.
Treatment and Prognosis
Classic CJD is always fatal, usually within a few months. There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the progression of disease. So, treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable.
Similar diseases
Though they have very similar names, CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are not the same disease. Both are prion diseases. However, variant CJD is tied to eating meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (sometimes called Mad Cow Disease). CJD, sometimes called ""classic CJD"" to avoid confusion, mostly occurs sporadically. Unlike variant CJD, classic CJD is not caused by any other prion disease.
In general, classic CJD affects people older than 55 while vCJD cases were younger, with an average age of 28. Classic CJD progresses much more quickly, causing death in an average of 4-5 months, while vCJD averages more than a year.

About Handwashing
KEY POINTS
Many diseases and conditions are spread by not washing hands with soap and clean, running water.
Handwashing with soap is one of the best ways to stay healthy.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands.
Why it's important
Washing hands can keep you healthy and prevent the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections. Germs can spread from person to person or from surfaces to people when you:
Touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands
Prepare or eat food and drinks with unwashed hands
Touch surfaces or objects that have germs on them
Blow your nose, cough, or sneeze into hands and then touch other people's hands or common objects
Key times to wash hands
You can help yourself and your loved ones stay healthy by washing your hands often, especially during these key times when you are likely to get and spread germs:
Before, during, and after preparing food
Before and after eating food
Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea
Before and after treating a cut or wound
After using the toilet
After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste
After handling pet food or pet treats
After touching garbage
How it works
Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Follow these five steps every time.
Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.
Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
Dry your hands using a clean towel or an air dryer.
Use hand sanitizer when you can't use soap and water
Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label.

Enough clinical background information to enable CDC CISA clinical staff to evaluate the inquiry properly. Do not include patient names or personal identifying health information in the request.
Disclaimer
Advice from CDC and CISA is meant to assist in decision-making rather than to provide direct patient management. Patient management decisions are the responsibility of the treating healthcare provider. CISA may require up to three months to collect and review all pertinent medical records, review the medical literature, review vaccine safety surveillance reports for similar reports of adverse events, and discuss the case on a clinical consultation call with CISA members and the patient's healthcare provider.
Consultation process
Provider submits their free clinical consultation request.
CDC or CISA staff will contact you if more information is required.
The CDC CISA Team reviews and sends select inquiries to the CISA project sites for in-depth evaluation.
If not sent for evaluation, the CDC CISA Team addresses the question or defers to another channel for a response.
CISA notifies provider if they will review their case (within 1–2 weeks after submission of request).
CISA meets to conduct clinical case evaluation. Often, the requesting healthcare provider attends and participates in the discussion.
During each case's evaluation, an investigator presents:
The clinical case, including the history of present illness (the adverse event following vaccination).
Detailed physical examination and diagnostic (laboratory and other) findings.
A summary of literature related to the condition and other vaccine safety data, such as from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
Experts discuss the findings and form a general assessment and plan.
CISA shares conclusions with the healthcare provider.
Usually, CISA investigators and CDC have no direct contact with the patient.
Keep in mind
If you are not a healthcare provider or health department staff member and have a vaccine safety question: Ask your healthcare provider to send an inquiry on your behalf by following the steps above, OR Call 1-800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636) or visit www.cdc.gov/cdc-info.

Laws and regulations
Law
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (42 USC 263a)
1
The CLIA statute is an amendment to the Public Health Services Act. In this Act, Congress revised the federal program for certification and oversight of clinical laboratory testing. Two subsequent amendments were made after 1988. The law continues to be cited as CLIA ’88 as named in legislation.
Regulations
Standards and Certification: Laboratory Requirements (42 CFR 493)
1
The section of the federal regulations titled ""Standards and Certification: Laboratory Requirements"" is issued by CMS. It's purpose is to enact the CLIA law passed by Congress (see below).
CLIA regulations establish quality standards for laboratory testing performed on specimens from humans, such as blood, body fluid, and tissue. This is done for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease, or assessment of health. The final CLIA regulations were published in 1992, phased in through 1994, and amended in 1993, 1995, and 2003.
Visit CLIA Documents to search and view the Federal Register Notices and former editions of the Code of Federal Regulations. It is published each October.

About Liver Flukes
KEY POINTS
Liver flukes are parasites that can infect humans and cause liver and bile duct disease.
There are two families of liver flukes that cause disease in humans: Opisthorchiidae (which includes species of Clonorchis and Opisthorchis) and Fasciolidae (which includes species of Fasciola).
These two families of liver flukes differ in their geographic distribution, life cycle, and long-term outcome after clinical infection.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Liver Flukes
Clonorchiasis (Clonorchis Infection)
Clonorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Clonorchis (also known as Chinese liver fluke disease), is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
You cannot get Clonorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Clonorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).
Fasciola (Fascioliasis Infection)
Fasciola is a liver fluke that can infect the liver and bile duct of exposed people and animals, such as sheep, cattle, goats, and other plant-eating domestic and wild animals.
Fasciola parasites can cause an infectious disease called fascioliasis. Generally, fascioliasis is more common in people who live or work around livestock (e.g., sheep, cattle, goats) in areas where animal infections are common.
Two Fasciola species can infect people:
Fasciola hepatica: the main species that infects people. Other names are ""the common liver fluke"" and ""the sheep liver fluke.""
Fasciola gigantica: a related species that primarily affects domestic and wild animals but can also infect people.
Fascioliasis occurs in all continents except Antarctica, in over 70 countries, especially where there are sheep, cattle, or goats.
In most cases, people can get Fasciola infection by eating raw watercress or other freshwater plants contaminated by larvae.
People can get infected by consuming contaminated water that they drink. People can also get infected by eating vegetables that they washed or irrigated with contaminated water.
People cannot get Fasciola from another person.
Opisthorchis (Opisthorchis Infection)
Opisthorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Opisthorchis is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
There is Opisthorchis viverrini (i.e., the Southeast Asian liver fluke) and O. felineus (i.e., the cat liver fluke).
You cannot get Opisthorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Opisthorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).

About Botulism
KEY POINTS
Botulism is a rare but serious illness.
It is caused by a toxin that attacks the body’s nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death.
The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and related bacteria.
There are five main kinds of botulism. All are medical emergencies.
Overview
Botulism (""BOT-choo-liz-um"") is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death.
The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and sometimes Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii bacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants.
The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it's rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions.
The spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they're eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known.
The conditions in which the spores can grow and make toxin are:
Low-oxygen or no oxygen (anaerobic) environment
Low acid
Low sugar
Low salt
A certain temperature range
A certain amount of water
For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly.
Most common types
There are 5 main kinds of botulism.
Foodborne botulism
Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin.
Wound botulism
Wound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a toxin. People who inject illicit drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People who have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound botulism.
Infant botulism
For reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get into their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin.
Iatrogenic botulism
Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can happen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches.
Adult intestinal toxemia
Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind of botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's intestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don't know why people get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut might be more likely to get ill.
All kinds of botulism can be fatal and are medical emergencies.
If you or your child has signs and symptoms of botulism, immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room. Do not wait.

APRIL 3, 2024
About C. perfringens food poisoning
KEY POINTS
Almost 1 million people get C. perfringens food poisoning every year in the United States.
C. perfringens food poisoning can cause diarrhea and stomach cramps.
Food not kept at safe temperatures can cause C. perfringens food poisoning.
Overview
Clostridium perfringens bacteria are a common cause of food poisoning in the United States. CDC estimates that C. perfringens causes nearly 1 million foodborne illnesses in the United States each year.
How C. perfringens makes people sick
C. perfringens makes spores, which have protective coatings. After a person eats food contaminated with the C. perfringens, the bacteria can make a toxin (poison) that causes diarrhea.
Foods linked to C. perfringens food poisoning
Most often foods cooked in large batches and held at unsafe temperatures
(between 40°F and 140°F) are involved in outbreaks of C. perfringens food poisoning.
Some foods linked commonly to C. perfringens food poisoning include
Poultry, such as turkey and chicken
Meat, such as beef and pork
Gravy
Outbreaks linked to C. perfringens food poisoning
Outbreaks of C. perfringens food poisoning tend to happen in settings where large groups of people are served and keeping food at proper temperatures may be difficult. These settings include
Hospitals
School cafeterias
Prisons
Nursing homes, and
Large events with catered food
Most outbreaks happen in November and December. Many of them have been linked to popular holiday foods, such as turkey and roast beef.

About Clostridium sordellii
KEY POINTS
Clostridium sordellii (also called C. sordellii) is a bacterium that, in rare cases, can cause serious health issues.
We do not know how C. sordellii spreads.
Women are at highest risk of infection from C. sordellii following the end of pregnancy.
Overview
Clostridium sordellii (also called C. sordellii) is a bacterium that, in rare cases, can cause pneumonia, endocarditis, arthritis, peritonitis, myonecrosis, and in some rare cases, bacteremia and sepsis. C. sordellii can be found in the environment (e.g., soil).
In some cases, people can carry the bacteria without being infected, known as colonization. The source of C. sordellii is likely the vagina, which is known to be colonized with Clostridium species in some females.
Signs and symptoms
Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Sometimes abdominal pain without fever
In a small number of cases, people infected with C. sordellii experienced severe toxic shock syndrome, though this was most often associated with gynecologic infections in women and umbilical stump infections in newborns.123
At-risk populations
Women are at highest risk of infection from C. sordellii following the end of pregnancy, including live births or spontaneous abortion (i.e., miscarriage). Though fatal infections have occurred after medical abortion, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not detected C. sordellii in either of the medications used in the procedure.4
If women experience symptoms of C. sordellii infections following the end of a pregnancy, it's important they see a healthcare provider for further tests.
What CDC is doing
CDC experts worked together with state and local health agencies and the FDA to investigate deaths associated with C. sordellii.4
CDC also works with the FDA to:
Raise awareness of research findings in medical and public health communities.
Identify cases.
Evaluate data.
Monitor and decrease risks of medical abortions.
Hemophilia
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
MAY 15, 2024
Diagnosing Hemophilia
KEY POINTS
Hemophilia is diagnosed using screening tests followed by more specific clotting factor tests.
Screening tests show if blood is clotting properly.
Clotting factor tests indicate whether a person has hemophilia, the type of hemophilia, and the severity.
Who should get tested or screened
Families with a history of hemophilia
Any family history of bleeding, such as following surgery or injury, or unexplained deaths among brothers, sisters, or male relatives such as maternal uncles, grandfathers, or cousins should be discussed with a doctor to see if hemophilia was a cause. A doctor will often get a thorough family history to find out if a bleeding disorder exists in the family.
Some babies should be tested for hemophilia soon after birth, including
Babies born to families with a history of hemophilia
Babies whose mothers are carriers of hemophilia
Babies who have bleeding symptoms at birth
Umbilical cord blood testing is better at finding low levels of factor VIII (8) (the factor that is low in hemophilia A) than it is at finding low levels of factor IX (9) (the factor that is low in hemophilia B). This is because factor IX levels take more time to develop and are not at a normal level until a baby is at least 6 months of age. Therefore, a mildly low level of factor IX at birth does not necessarily mean that the baby has hemophilia B. A repeat test when the baby is older might be needed in some cases. Learn more about the inheritance pattern for hemophilia.
Families with no previous history of hemophilia
About 1 in 3 babies who are diagnosed with hemophilia have no other family members with the disorder. A doctor might check for hemophilia in a newborn if
Bleeding after circumcision of the penis goes on for a long time
Bleeding goes on for a long time after drawing blood or doing heel sticks (pricking the infant's heel to draw blood for newborn screening tests)
Bleeding in the head (scalp or brain) after a difficult delivery or after using special devices or instruments to help deliver the baby (for example, vacuum or forceps).
Unusual, raised bruises or large numbers of bruises
If a child with hemophilia is not diagnosed during the newborn period, the family might notice unusual bruising once the child begins standing or crawling.
Those with severe hemophilia can have serious bleeding problems right away and are often diagnosed during the first year of life. People with milder forms of hemophilia might not be diagnosed until later in life.
When to get tested or screened
Many people who have or have had family members with hemophilia will ask that their baby be tested soon after birth.
Types of tests
Diagnosis includes screening tests and clotting factor tests. Screening tests are blood tests that show if the blood is clotting properly. Clotting factor tests, also called factor assays, determine the clotting activity of factors VIII and IX in the blood. Factors VIII and IX are proteins in the blood that help form clots and stop bleeding.
Screening tests
Screening tests are blood tests that show if the blood is clotting properly. Types of screening tests include the following:
Complete blood count (CBC)
This test measures the amount of hemoglobin (the red pigment inside red blood cells that carries oxygen), the size and number of red blood cells, and numbers of different types of white blood cells and platelets found in blood. The CBC might be normal in people with hemophilia. However, if a person with hemophilia has unusually heavy bleeding or bleeds for a long time, the hemoglobin and the red blood cell count can be low.
Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test
This test measures how long it takes for blood to clot. It measures the clotting ability of factors VIII (8), IX (9), XI (11), and XII (12). If any of these clotting factors is too low, it takes longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will show a longer clotting time among people with hemophilia A or B.
Prothrombin time (PT) test
This test also measures the time it takes for blood to clot. It measures primarily the clotting ability of factors I (1), II (2), V (5), VII (7), and X (10). If any of these factors are too low, it takes longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will be normal among most people with hemophilia A and B.
Fibrinogen test
This test also helps doctors assess a patient's ability to form a blood clot. This test is ordered either along with other blood clotting tests or when a patient has an abnormal PT or APTT test result, or both. Fibrinogen is another name for clotting factor I.
Screening tests and clotting factor tests are used for diagnosis.
Clotting factor tests
Clotting factor tests, also called factor assays, determine the clotting activity of factors VIII and IX in the blood. Factors VIII and IX are proteins in the blood that help form clots and stop bleeding. Clotting factor tests are required to diagnose a bleeding disorder and will show the type of hemophilia and the severity. It is important to know the type and severity in order to create the best treatment plan.
Hemophilia severity classification
Baseline clotting factor activity is used to determine hemophilia severity. It is measured prior to receiving any treatment and is used because it best represents a person's inherent clotting factor activity.
Results are reported as a percentage of a ""normal"" level of clotting factor. The average normal factor level is 100%, with the normal range generally defined as 50% to 150%.
The hemophilia severity categories based on clotting factor levels in the table below were defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) in 2001.12
Severity
Levels of factor VIII (8) or factor IX (9) in the blood
Mild hemophilia
Greater than 5% but less than 40%
Moderate hemophilia
1% to 5%
Severe hemophilia
Less than 1%
Table notes. The 2001 ISTH classification did not address individuals with clotting factor levels ≥40% but <50%. However, bleeding has been observed in some individuals with clotting factor levels ≥40% and researchers are taking steps towards classifying these individuals. In 20213, ISTH recommended the following terms for women and girls with an abnormal hemophilia gene who have a clotting factor level ≥40%: ""symptomatic carrier"" (a person who has clotting factor levels ≥40% and bleeding symptoms) and ""asymptomatic carrier"" (a person who has clotting factor levels ≥40% who does not have bleeding symptoms). Women and girls with an abnormal hemophilia gene who have a clotting factor level <40% are classified as having mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia depending on their exact clotting factor level.

Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program
AT A GLANCE
The NIOSH Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) studies respiratory diseases in miners related to coal mine dust exposure. The program also provides health information to miners through health screenings and surveillance.
Overview
The CWHSP was established by the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969
. Its mission is to detect lung disease early in coal miners and to prevent progression to severe lung disease. The CWHSP offers health screenings for miners and allows researchers to identify trends in disease across the nation.
The CWHSP aims to help coal miners stay healthy.
Black lung screenings
CWHSP provides U.S. coal miners with the opportunity to receive black lung screenings at no cost to miners. They are available when miners initially begin employment in coal mining and at intervals throughout their coal mining careers. For more information, go to the Black Lung Screenings page.
B Reader Program
The NIOSH B Reader Program trains and certifies physicians in the International Labour Organization, International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses
. U.S. regulations specify roles for B Readers in classifying chest x-ray images of workers in jobs involving exposure to:
Coal mine dust
Crystalline silica
Asbestos
B Readers also perform classifications in a range of other settings, including research, legal, and evaluation for benefits.
Special notice to coal miners
Part 90
The Mine Safety and Health Administration announced an effort to raise awareness of Part 90
. These regulations give coal miners with black lung the right to work in areas with lower dust levels without reduced pay, discrimination, or termination. Learn more at Miner Health Matters
.
National autopsy study
The Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 authorizes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide coal miner autopsies and to pay for their submission to NIOSH. Refer to Specification for Medical Examinations of Coal Miners Subpart Autopsies
for more information.
At this time, funding is not available to pay for autopsies.
Data-use agreement
Michigan State University (MSU) researchers are developing artificial intelligence models to classify digital chest x-rays for findings of pneumoconiosis. To assist, NIOSH has entered into a data-use agreement that allows MSU to use anonymous digital chest x-rays from CWHSP. Names and identifying information have been removed from the chest x-rays. The agreement does not allow MSU to share the x-rays with anyone else or use the x-rays for purposes other than this research. We hope that having the ability to use artificial intelligence to classify chest x-rays will help physicians in their efforts to perform consistent and accurate classifications using the International Labour Organization's classification standards

Pneumoconioses Disease
EXPLORE TOPICS

JANUARY 19, 2024
About Pneumoconioses
KEY POINTS
The pneumoconioses are a group of lung diseases caused by the lung’s reaction when breathing in certain dusts.
The main cause of the pneumoconioses is workplace exposure.
All forms of pneumoconioses can be severe.
Overview
Healthy lung versus black lung.
The primary pneumoconioses are:
Abestosis – caused by inhaling asbestos fibers
Silicosis – caused by inhaling silica dust
Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (commonly referred to as CWP or black lung) caused by inhaling coal mine dust
There is also a form called mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Byssinosis, caused by exposure to cotton dust, is sometimes included with pneumoconioses. Although the pattern of lung abnormality in Byssinosis is different from the types of disease listed above. Also, many consider the term pneumoconosis as referring only to diseases caused by inhaling mineral dusts.
Pneumoconiosis typically takes years to develop. However, rapidly progressive forms of silicosis can occur after short periods of intense exposure. When severe, the diseases often lead to lung impairment, disability, and premature death. Pneumoconioses can be avoided through appropriate dust control.
Other forms of pneumoconiosis can be caused by inhaling dusts containing:
Aluminum
Antimony
Barium
Graphite
Iron
Kaolin
Mica
Talc
Symptoms
Pneumoconiosis symptoms depend on how severe the disease is. They include:
Shortness of breath
Coughing
Increased phlegm
Diagnosis
Identifying and classifying pneumoconioses
Lung x-ray showing pneumoconiosis in coal miner.
The pneumoconioses are typically detected through radiological imaging. Severity of lung impairment can be assessed using pulmonary function tests. The International Labor Office (ILO) provides guidelines
for classifying radiographs of the pneumoconioses.
NIOSH operates the B Reader Program. This program allows physicians to document their proficiency in classifying radiographs (using ILO guidelines) by taking an examination.
Treatment
Pneumoconiosis cannot be cured. Controlling symptoms through proper treatment is vital. Workers should avoid exposure to dust and smoking. Treatment may include oxygen or medications that help to open lung passages. Workers should see a doctor if they have symptoms they suspect are related to their workplace.

Working in the Cold
KEY POINTS
Workers exposed to extreme cold or cold environments may experience cold stress and be at risk for a cold-related illness.
Types of cold-related illness include hypothermia, frostbite, trench foot, and chilblains.
Overview
Cold stress can affect workers who work in cold environments. When temperatures drop below normal, heat can rapidly leave your body.
Some workers may be at risk of health emergencies due to cold stress, including:
Outdoor workers
Workers in poorly insulated or unheated areas
Workers in areas without shelter
What constitutes cold stress and its effects can vary across different areas of the country. In regions unaccustomed to winter weather, near freezing temperatures are considered factors for cold stress.
Reducing your risk
Employers
Employers can take the following steps to protect workers from cold stress:
Schedule cold jobs for warmer months or the warmer part of the day.
Use relief workers or assign extra workers for long jobs.
Provide warm liquids to workers.
Provide warm areas for use during breaks.
Limit the amount of time outside on extremely cold days.
Monitor workers who are at risk of cold stress.
Provide cold stress training that includes information about:
Worker risk
Prevention
Symptoms
Monitoring yourself and coworkers for symptoms
Treatment
Personal protective equipment
Workers
Avoid exposure to extremely cold temperatures when possible. When cold environments or temperatures cannot be avoided:
Wear appropriate clothing.
Wear several layers of loose clothing for better insulation.
Some clothing may restrict movement, which could be dangerous.
Make sure to protect the ears, face, hands, and feet.
Boots should be waterproof and insulated.
Wear a hat. Hats reduce body heat escaping from your head.
Move into warm locations during breaks.
Carry extra socks, gloves, hat, jacket, clothes, and blankets.
Include a thermometer and chemical hot packs in your first aid kit.
Avoid touching cold metal surfaces with bare skin.
Monitor your physical condition and that of your coworkers.

Cold Versus Flu
PURPOSE
Influenza (flu) and the common cold are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses.
Colds and flu share many symptoms, so it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.
Cold symptoms are usually milder than flu.
Special tests can tell if a person is sick with flu.
Understanding the Differences Between a Cold and the Flu:
Influenza (flu) and the common cold are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. Flu is caused by influenza viruses only, whereas the common cold can be caused by a number of different viruses, including rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, and seasonal coronaviruses. Seasonal coronaviruses should not be confused with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Because flu and the common cold have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. In general, flu is worse than the common cold, and symptoms are typically more intense and begin more abruptly. Colds are usually milder than flu. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose than people who have flu. Colds generally do not result in serious health problems, such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations. Flu can have serious associated complications.
Key Differences Between a Cold and the Flu:
Because colds and flu share many symptoms, it can be difficult (or even impossible) to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Special tests can tell if a person is sick with flu.
Flu Symptoms vs. Cold Symptoms:
The signs and symptoms of flu can include fever or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue (tiredness). Cold symptoms are usually milder than the symptoms of flu. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. Colds generally do not result in serious health problems.

About Common Cold
KEY POINTS
Different respiratory viruses can cause a cold.
You can get a cold any time of year.
Colds usually last less than a week.
Overview
A cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (also called an upper respiratory infection or URI). Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.
Signs and symptoms
The signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:
Runny nose or nasal congestion
Cough
Sneezing
Sore throat
Headache
Mild body aches
Fever (usually low grade in older children and adults)
Complications
Complications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:
Mild to moderate:
Middle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)
Sinus infections
Potentially severe:
Asthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)
Bronchitis (infection of the large airways)
Pneumonia (infection of the lungs)
Worsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)
Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness. This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.
Causes and spread
Causes
More than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses (including EV-D68), and human metapneumovirus.
SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested, especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.
Spread
Different respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
You can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.
Tip
You can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others. Read CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance.

About Common Cold
KEY POINTS
Different respiratory viruses can cause a cold.
You can get a cold any time of year.
Colds usually last less than a week.
Overview
A cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (also called an upper respiratory infection or URI). Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.
Signs and symptoms
The signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:
Runny nose or nasal congestion
Cough
Sneezing
Sore throat
Headache
Mild body aches
Fever (usually low grade in older children and adults)
Complications
Complications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:
Mild to moderate:
Middle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)
Sinus infections
Potentially severe:
Asthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)
Bronchitis (infection of the large airways)
Pneumonia (infection of the lungs)
Worsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)
Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness. This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.
Causes and spread
Causes
More than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses (including EV-D68), and human metapneumovirus.
SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested, especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.
Spread
Different respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
You can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.
Tip
You can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others. Read CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance.

Electrical Safety in the Workplace
KEY POINTS
Only work on energized equipment or distribution systems if you are qualified and using appropriate PPE.
Understand approach distances from energized powerlines.
Make sure proper energy control procedures are used/followed and verify de-energization.
Why it's an issue
Many workers are unaware of the potential electrical hazards present in their work environment when completing tasks that involve electricity.
Electrical hazards
Electric shock and burns from contact with energized parts
Injury from exposure to arcing
Fire from faulty electrical equipment or installations
Arcing occurs when electricity jumps from one circuit to another.
Qualified vs. unqualified persons
Keep in mind
The only people that should do electrical work are qualified persons.
Qualified persons are trained to work on or near energized parts. They must have the skills and techniques necessary to distinguish exposed energized parts from other parts of electric equipment.
Qualified persons whose work on energized equipment involves direct contact or contact through tools or materials must also have training on appropriate PPE and electrical safety procedures.
Unqualified persons
Unqualified persons should not work on energized parts.
Unqualified persons should stay 10 feet away from energized parts.
Electrical injuries
Electrical injuries can be fatal. There are four main types of electrical injuries:
Electrocution (fatal)
Electric shock
Burns/Arc blast
Falls from height
Fatal falls from height commonly involve ladders and are caused from contact with overhead electrical lines.
For more information about electrical injuries in construction, see CPWR Electrical Injuries in Construction
.
For information about electrical injuries and fatalities, see IIF Databases : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
.
Industries at risk
2018-2020
The utility and construction industries had the highest rates of injuries from exposure to electricity that resulted in days away from work. (BLS SOII Case and Demographic Data)
2020-2022
The highest number of electrocutions occurred in three industries (BLS CFOI Data):
Construction
Manufacturing
Trade, transportation, and utilities
For more information on high-risk industries, see IIF Databases : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
.
Recommendations
Employers and managers should only assign electrical work to qualified persons.
To prevent electrical injury, qualified persons should:
De-energize electrical circuits before doing any type of work.
Use lockout devices to prevent a circuit from becoming energized.
Use an AC voltage tester to verify that the electrical power is off.
Use insulated tools and PPE when working with live electricity.

About Falls in the Workplace
KEY POINTS KEY POINTS
Falls can happen at any workplace.
Fall injuries are preventable.
NIOSH conducts research to prevent work-related injuries and deaths from falls across all industries.
Why it's important
Fall injuries are a common workplace injury.
The construction industry experiences the highest frequency of fall-related deaths. These deaths are mostly falls from heights.
The highest counts of nonfatal fall injuries are in the educational and health services and the healthcare and social assistance industries. These injuries are mostly slips and falls on the same level.
Other industries at high risk of fall injuries include:
Nursing and residential care
Ambulance services
Building cleaning and maintenance
Transportation and material moving
Fact
In 2020, 805 workers died from falls.1 211,640 suffered severe injuries requiring days away from work in the private industry.2
Impacts
Fall injuries create a considerable financial burden. In the United States, workers' compensation and medical expenses associated with workplace falls are estimated to cost $70 billion annually.3
Other countries face similar challenges in the workplace. In fact, the international public health community has a strong interest in developing strategies to reduce fall injuries.
National campaign to prevent falls
Falls are the number one cause of construction worker fatalities. The goal of the national campaign is to prevent fatal falls. Each year as part of the campaign, there is a National Stand-Down focusing on fall prevention.
Safety risks
Falls in the workplace frequently involve:
Unprotected edges
Unsafely positioned ladders
Misused fall protection
Water, grease, and other contaminants on the floor
Clutter and tripping hazards in walkways
Irregularities in the floor and wall openings
Prevention
Federal regulations and industry consensus standards provide specific measures and performance-based recommendations for fall prevention and protection. However, persistent unsafe practices and low safety culture across many industries define steady fall injury rates each year.
Reducing fall injury and death rates require:
Implementing new effective fall prevention and protection technologies
Using appropriate PPE like harnesses, fall guards, and slip-resistant footwear4
Improving the work safety culture by educating the workforce
These efforts require continued collaboration from:
Regulators
Industry leaders
Professional associations
Labor unions
Employers and employees
Safety professionals
Researchers
Traumatic occupational injury research labs
NIOSH conducts research to prevent work-related injuries and deaths from falls across all industries. Review our Traumatic Occupational Injury Research Labs brochure for an overview of DSR labs.
What CDC is doing
As a leader in occupational safety research, NIOSH plays a key role in these complex fall-injury prevention efforts. NIOSH bases fall-injury prevention research strategic planning and goal setting on:
The magnitude or emergence of the problem as shown by data
Immediacy of need
Resources and expertise available to work on the problem
Current research
Strength of partnerships
Status and momentum on research-to-practice efforts
Input from the National Academy of Sciences program review enhances the strategic planning process.

Mold
WHAT TO KNOW
Mold can look like spots of many different colors, and it can smell musty. If you see or smell mold, you should remove it.
If mold is growing in your home, you need to clean up the mold and fix the moisture problem.
Learn what mold is, how to prevent it, and how to clean it up.
Overview
There is always some mold around. Molds have been on the Earth for millions of years. Mold can get in your home through open doors, windows, vents, and heating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can be brought indoors on clothing, shoes, bags, and even pets.
Mold will grow where there is moisture, such as around leaks in roofs, windows, or pipes, or where there has been a flood. Mold grows on paper, cardboard, ceiling tiles, and wood. Mold can also grow in dust, paints, wallpaper, insulation, drywall, carpet, fabric, and upholstery.
Common types
The most common indoor molds are Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus.
Mold is found both indoors and outdoors. Mold can enter your home through open doorways, windows, vents, and heating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can also attach itself to clothing, shoes, and pets can and be carried indoors.
When mold spores drop on places with excessive moisture, such as where leakage may have occurred in roofs, pipes, walls, plant pots, or where there has been flooding, they will grow.
Possible health effects
Exposure to damp and moldy environments may cause a variety of health effects, or none at all.
For some people, mold can cause a stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing or wheezing, burning eyes, or skin rash. People with asthma or who are allergic to mold may have severe reactions. Immune-compromised people and people with chronic lung disease may get infections in their lungs from mold. For people who are sensitive to molds exposure to molds can lead to symptoms such as stuffy nose, wheezing, and red or itchy eyes, or skin. Severe reactions, such as fever or shortness of breath, may occur among workers exposed to large amounts of molds in occupational settings, such as farmers working around moldy hay.
In 2004 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found there was sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure to mold with upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheeze in otherwise healthy people; with asthma symptoms in people with asthma; and with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in individuals susceptible to that immune-mediated condition.
In 2009, the World Health Organization issued additional guidance, the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould. Other recent studies have suggested a potential link of early mold exposure to development of asthma in some children, particularly among children who may be genetically susceptible to asthma development, and that selected interventions that improve housing conditions can reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies.
Preventing
There are steps you can take to prevent mold growth in your home.
Keep humidity levels in your home as low as you can — no higher than 50% — all day long. An air conditioner or dehumidifier will help you keep the level low.
Be sure the air in your home flows freely. Use exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom that vent to outside your home. Make sure your clothes dryer vents outside your home.
Fix any leaks in your home's roof, walls, or plumbing so mold does not have moisture to grow.
Clean up and dry out your home fully and quickly (within 24–48 hours) after a flood.
Add mold inhibitors to paints before painting. You can buy mold inhibitors at paint and home improvement stores.
Clean bathrooms with mold-killing products.
Remove or replace carpets and upholstery that have been soaked and cannot be dried right away. Don't use carpet in places like bathrooms or basements that may have a lot of moisture.
Cleaning
If you see or smell mold, you should remove it. You do not need to know the type of mold. If mold is growing in your home, you need to clean up the mold and fix the moisture problem.
Mold can be removed from hard surfaces with household products, soap and water, or a bleach solution of no more than 1 cup of household laundry bleach in 1 gallon of water.
If you use bleach
Never mix bleach with ammonia or other cleaners. This will produce a poisonous gas.
Follow manufacturers' instructions when you use bleach or any other cleaning product.
Open windows and doors to provide fresh air.
Wear rubber boots, rubber gloves, and goggles during cleanup.
For more information, read the guide on safely cleaning up mold
(Also available in Spanish and Vietnamese)
Homeowners and Renters Guide to Mold Cleanup After Disasters
Guidance from CDC, EPA, FEMA, HUD, and NIH on safe mold clean-up after a natural disaster
MAR. 27, 2024
Home testing
CDC does not recommend mold testing.
The health effects of mold are different for different people so you cannot rely on sampling and culturing to know whether someone might become sick. No matter what type of mold is present, you need to remove it.
Also, good sampling for mold can be expensive, and there are no set standards for what is and what is not an acceptable quantity of different kinds of mold in a home. The best thing you can do is to safely remove the mold and prevent future mold growth.

Trenching and Excavation Safety
KEY POINTS
Workers should never work in an unprotected trench.
A trench can collapse or cave-in at any moment.
Without a protective system in place, a trench collapse can crush and suffocate workers.
Overview
Working in an unprotected trench is dangerous. The walls can collapse suddenly and without warning. When this happens, workers do not have time to move out of the way.
While a small amount of dirt may not seem dangerous, one square yard of dirt can weigh more than 3,000 pounds. This weighs the same as a compact car. This small amount of dirt is enough to fatally crush and suffocate workers.
Injuries and deaths related to trench collapses continue to happen. From the years 2003 to 2017, there were a total of 373 trenching deaths. More than 80% of those deaths happened in the construction industry. Workers do not often survive trench collapses, but we can prevent them.
Workers use a trench box to shield the trench against collapse.
Keeping workers safe
There are ways to prevent trench collapses. Engineering controls, protective equipment, and safe work practices can reduce hazards to workers and prevent trench cave-ins.
Workers should never enter a trench that does not have a protective system in place.
A competent person
should design and install the protective system. A competent person can find hazards and correct them.
Workers can take training to become a competent person. Training is available from many sources, including:
insurance companies,
trade associations,
labor unions, and
companies that make safety equipment for trench workers.
Preventing trench collapses
Planning
To prevent trench collapses, employers must plan before the job begins. Employers should:
Assign and train a competent person.
Call 811 to identify and mark underground utility lines.
Dig a minimum of 5 feet away from utility lines.
Evaluate the soil to determine its stability.
Plan the job layout to identify safe locations for spoil piles and heavy equipment routes.
Before the job starts, if the trench will be 5 feet or deeper, set up a protective system.
If the trench will be 20 feet or deeper, provide engineering protections.
Have a traffic control plan and lane closure permits.
Develop a trench emergency action plan.
OSHA Standard
The OSHA standard for excavations, including trenches, is 29 CFR* 1926 Subpart P
. This standard de­scribes the precautions needed for safe excavation work. OSHA requires that all excavations 5 feet deep or great­er make use of one of the following pro­tective system options:
Sloping the ground
Benching the ground
Shoring the trench with supports (such as planking or hydraulic jacks)
Shielding the trench (using a trench box)
Other Methods
The best way to prevent trench collapse and trenching-related deaths is to use other methods when possible. Some other options include:
directional boring,
relining the pipe,
pipe ramming, and
utility tunneling or pipe jacking.
Robots can be used on construction sites to transport, line, and join large pipes to protect workers from serious injuries. Robots may reduce the need for pipe layers and other helpers to work at the bottom of the trench.
Planning is required before a job starts. Before you dig it, plan it!
Programs and initiatives

About Contact Lenses
KEY POINTS
Contact lenses are an effective way to correct vision, but they must be worn and cared for properly to avoid eye infections.
Failure to wear, clean, and store them as directed can increase the risk of eye infections, such as microbial keratitis.
Overview
When cared for properly, contact lenses can provide a comfortable and convenient way to work, play, and live for the 45 million people in the U.S. who wear them. While contact lenses are usually a safe and effective form of vision correction, they are not entirely risk-free—especially if they are not cared for properly.
Contact lenses are medical devices. Failure to wear, clean, and store them as directed can increase the risk of eye infections, such as microbial keratitis. To enjoy the benefits of wearing contact lenses, it is essential to practice healthy habits. Remember: Healthy Habits = Healthy Eyes.
Contact lenses are a common form of vision correction.
Reducing risk
Wearing and caring for contact lenses properly is critical to keeping the eyes healthy and preventing eye infections; however, the majority of contact lens wearers do not practice proper contact lens hygiene.
Since 2006, in the US there have been multiple outbreaks of Acanthamoeba keratitis and Fungal keratitis—both of which are very serious eye infections that can result in vision loss or blindness. These outbreaks have brought attention to contact lens wearer hygiene and the need for consistent information about how to wear and care for contact lenses to help prevent such infections.

Control Banding
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
MARCH 4, 2024
Control Banding
WHAT TO KNOW
Control banding is a technique used to guide the assessment and management of workplace risks for chemicals that have no occupational exposure limit (OEL).
Why it's important
Occupational exposure limits (OELs) indicate the maximum allowable concentration of a chemical substance within the workplace. Levels at or above the OEL can increase the risk of workplace exposure. OELs include NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) and OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). Most chemicals in commercial use have not been assigned an OEL.
Repeated occupational exposure to a chemical, even below its OEL, may not lead to harmful health effects in most workers. Many commercially available chemicals and chemical mixtures have not been assigned an OEL from an authoritative source.
Control Banding Process
EXPAND ALL
Workplace risks are grouped into control categories or “bands” based on assessing hazard and exposure information.
A ""band of hazards"" might be:
skin/eye irritant,
very toxic, or
carcinogenic, among others.
The potential for exposure (low, medium, high) is also considered. The exposure potential includes the following considerations:
duration of task,
amount of chemical handled,
or the form of the chemical.
At the end of the control banding process, users have a proposed control measure to implement (see example matrix).
Example: Control banding matrix
Control measures serve to decrease risk. Examples of recommended control measures could be personal protective equipment, dilution ventilation, engineering controls, containment, or some other hazard control. This approach is based on two pillars:
there are a limited number of control approaches,
and many problems have been met and solved before.
Control banding uses the solutions that experts have developed previously to control occupational chemical exposures and suggests applying them to other tasks with similar exposure situations. It is an approach that focuses resources on exposure controls and describes how a risk needs to be managed. NIOSH considers control banding to be a potentially useful tool for small businesses.

Core State Injury Prevention Program (Core SIPP)
KEY POINTS
Core SIPP supports health departments to identify and respond to existing and emerging injury threats.
Injuries are the leading cause of death for Americans age 1 to 44.
Approximately 27 million people suffer non-fatal injuries requiring emergency department (ED) visits.
More than 240,000 individuals in the United States die each year because of injuries.
Overview
The Core State Injury Prevention Program (Core SIPP) supports health department infrastructure, data, and partnerships to identify and respond to existing and emerging injury threats with data-driven public health actions. This support is intended to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors using the best available evidence to prevent injuries and death. The Core SIPP program includes utilizing robust data and surveillance, strengthening strategic collaborations and partnerships, and conducting assessment and evaluation.
Why it matters
All grant recipients will focus their strategic efforts on preventing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and transportation-related injury. Recipients can also use up to 25% of their award to address identified priority injury topics of local concern such as drowning, older adult falls, or suicide. An enhanced funding component is available for a smaller number of recipients to implement and evaluate prevention strategies and/or conduct novel surveillance activities. Their goal is to contribute practice-based evidence to strengthen the overall evidence base for injury prevention.
CDC is committing approximately $33.5 million to support this grant program. Click here for the Core State Injury Prevention Program Notice of Funding Opportunity

Public Health Considerations for Correctional Health
PURPOSE
To provide people who are justice system-involved, correctional facility staff, public health professionals, community organizations, and anyone else with an interest in correctional health with resources.
Review CDC resources, guidelines, and data on correctional health and justice-involved populations
Correctional health is community health
CDC provides treatment guidelines and other correctional health resources.
Correctional health encompasses all aspects of health and well-being for adults and juveniles who are justice system*-involved. This starts at the point of arrest, continues at detention or incarceration, and carries through after they return to their community (called ""reentry""). Correctional health also includes the health of families and communities of persons who are justice system-involved, as well as the health administrators and staff who work in facilities.
Justice System-Involved
A person who is 'justice system-involved' is any person who is currently or has ever been arrested or incarcerated in a detention or correctional facility. This term also includes those reentering their communities after detention or incarceration, including those on parole or probation. 'Criminal legal system' may also be used as an alternative to 'justice system' to reflect historic and current challenges to achieving justice in the U.S. criminal legal system.
Persons who are justice system-involved are more likely to experience risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB), latent TB infection (LTBI), and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and concussions. The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries is higher than in the general population. Additionally, a high proportion of people with justice system involvement have a history of unstable housing and mental health and substance use disorders, which increases vulnerability and risk for HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection, and injuries like TBI. This puts many in need of linkage to substance use and mental health treatment, employment, and permanent housing upon release. Justice-involvement also leads to family and community instability and adverse childhood events, with 1 in 28 children having a caregiver who is incarcerated.
Taken together, these multiple health conditions and social determinates of health contribute to the health disparities found in this population and their communities.
CDC has worked to provide people who are justice system-involved, correctional facility staff, public health professionals, community organizations, and anyone else with an interest in correctional health with data, testing and treatment guidelines, educational materials, and other correctional health resources.

Read More
Community support
Funds partners working with health departments to improve health in the communities of justice-involved persons, particularly related to priority pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis, STIs, and TB.
Develops programs and guidance that address community health disparities and social determinants of health (SDOH).
Intake / entry
Develops intake screening and treatment guidance for use by clinicians/administrators of correctional health services and health departments.
During incarceration
Works with state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to investigate disease outbreaks.
Develops and provides useful health education materials for staff and justice-involved persons.
Reentry
Supports projects that improve the continuity of care for people returning to their communities.
Offers policy and planning guidance that support efforts to improve the continuity of care within communities.
Surveillance
Identifies/monitors cases and potential exposures to HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, TB, and other pathogens among persons who are justice-involved or work in correctional facilities.
Statistics
The prevalence of infections, diseases, and injuries among people who are incarcerated is higher than in the general population.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
, over 5 million people are estimated to be under the supervision of U.S. adult correctional systems (in prison or jail, or on probation or parole). Many persons who are justice-involved experience multiple risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI), and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and concussions. The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries among people who are incarcerated is higher than in the general population.
HIV
In 2021, about 1.1% of persons incarcerated in state and federal prisons were known to be persons with HIV; this rate was three times higher than the prevalence in the general U.S. population.
In 2021, 16 U.S. states conducted mandatory HIV testing of all persons under state law enforcement custody, and 23 states and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons offered opt-out HIV testing, accounting for 84% of all persons admitted and sentenced to more than 1 year in the custody of state and federal correctional authorities.
In a 2013 survey of women across 20 metropolitan areas with high HIV prevalence, women who were recently incarcerated were significantly more likely to have factors that increase their risk for HIV infection than those who were never incarcerated, including receiving money or drugs in exchange for sex with a partner, multiple casual partners, multiple casual condomless partners, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis.
More information on HIV surveillance in the United States.
Viral hepatitis
In 2009, a systematic review of 23 studies from incarcerated populations in the U.S. reported a wide chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence range of 0.9%–11.4%.
HBV prevalence has been estimated to be 3 to 38 times higher in correctional settings than in the general population in 2009.
From 2013–2016, people who were incarcerated were estimated to have a rate of current hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 10 times higher (10.7% vs 1%) than persons in the general population.
Approximately 30% of all persons infected with HCV in the United States spend at least part of the year in correctional facilities.
More information on Viral Hepatitis surveillance in the United States.
STIs
Males and females 35 years of age and younger in juvenile and adult detention facilities have been reported to have higher rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea than nonincarcerated persons in the community.
Jail-based chlamydia screen-and-treat programs can potentially decrease chlamydia prevalence in communities with higher incarceration rates —as much as 13% in large communities and 54% in small communities.
More information on STIs among persons in correctional facilities.
Tuberculosis (TB)
In 2021, 2.4% of persons 15 years of age or older diagnosed with tuberculosis were current residents of correctional facilities at the time of diagnosis.
From 2003–2013, annual median tuberculosis incidence was about 6 times higher for persons in jails and federal prisons compared with the general population.
An analysis during 2011–2019 demonstrated that large tuberculosis outbreaks still occur in state prisons and account for a large proportion of total tuberculosis cases in some states.
For more information on TB risk and people who live or work in correctional facilities.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
Research in the United States and from other countries suggests almost half (46%) of people in correctional or detention facilities such as prisons and jails have a history of TBI, but the exact number is not known.
Studies show an association between people in correctional or detention facilities with a history of TBI and mental health problems, such as severe depression and anxiety, substance use disorders, difficulty controlling anger, and suicidal thoughts and/or attempts.
People in correctional or detention facilities with TBI-related problems may not be screened for a TBI or may face challenges with getting TBI-related care. These challenges may continue after a person is released from the facility.

COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Reporting Systems
WHAT TO KNOW
Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccinations.
COVID-19 vaccines used in the response to the pandemic underwent the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. Safety monitoring used established systems.
CDC provides timely updates on selected adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event) reported to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccination.
Monitoring process
After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, vaccine safety systems monitor adverse events (rare health conditions) and watch for potential safety problems.
Keep Reading:
About CDC’s Vaccine Safety Monitoring Program
COVID-19 vaccines have undergone the most extensive safety analysis in U.S. history. The U.S. FDA COVID-19 Vaccines website
includes important recommendations for ongoing safety evaluations after any COVID-19 vaccine is made available under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or receives full FDA approval.
Monitoring systems
The following system and information sources were developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. They add an additional layer of safety monitoring, giving CDC and FDA the ability to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine safety in real time and make sure COVID-19 vaccines are as safe as possible.
General public
CDC's v-safe After Vaccination Health Checker: a smartphone-based platform for people and their dependents who receive COVID-19 vaccines.

FDA's Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) System
: a system of electronic health records, administrative, and claims-based data for active surveillance and research.
Pregnant women
The V-safe COVID-19 Vaccine Pregnancy Registry: a registry to collect additional health information from v-safe participants who report being pregnant at the time of vaccination or a positive pregnancy test after vaccination. This information helps CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women.
CDC's Birth Defects Study to Evaluate Pregnancy Exposures (BD-STEPS): an ongoing study that collects information, including COVID-19 vaccination information, from women who have recently been pregnant to understand the potential causes of birth defects and how to prevent them.

About Q fever
KEY POINTS
Symptoms of Q fever can be mild or severe.
There is not a vaccine to prevent Q fever available for use in the United States.
Your healthcare provider may order certain blood tests if you are suspected to have Q fever.
Most people who have Q fever will recover without antibiotics, but for symptomatic patients, doxycycline is the recommended antibiotic for treatment of Q fever.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Q fever is a disease caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii. These bacteria naturally infect some animals, such as goats, sheep, and cows. These bacteria are found in the birth products (i.e. placenta, amniotic fluid), urine, poop, and milk of infected animals. People can get infected by breathing in dust that has been contaminated by infected animal feces, urine, milk, and birth products. Some people never get sick; however, those who do usually develop flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, fatigue, and muscle pain. Some people develop chronic Q fever after they are infected.
Risk factors
People with certain jobs are at increased risk for exposure to Coxiella burnetii, including veterinarians, meat processing plant workers, dairy workers, livestock ranchers, and researchers at facilities housing sheep and goats. People working in these areas may need to take extra precautions (see MMWR R&R: Occupational Exposure and Prevention).
Prevention
Q fever vaccines are not available in the United States.
Reduce your risk of getting Q fever by avoiding contact with animals, especially while animals are giving birth. Animals can be infected with Coxiella burnetii and appear healthy.
Do not consume raw milk or raw milk products.
If you have been diagnosed with Q fever and have a history of heart valve disease, blood vessel abnormalities, a weakened immune system, or are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about your risk for developing chronic Q fever.
Diagnosis
The symptoms of Q fever are similar to many other diseases, often making diagnosis difficult. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, fever, fatigue, and muscle pain. See your healthcare provider if you develop symptoms after spending time with or near animals—particularly sheep, goats, and cattle—or in areas where these animals may have been.
Your healthcare provider may order blood tests to look for Q fever or for other diseases.
Laboratory testing and reporting of results can take several weeks, so your healthcare provider may start antibiotic treatment before results are available.
Treatment and recovery
Most people who are infected with Coxiella burnetii have no symptoms, or mild symptoms, and will recover without antibiotic treatment.
For people who develop symptomatic Q fever, treatment with 2 weeks of the antibiotic doxycycline is recommended.
Chronic Q fever
Develops in some individuals after infection.
A life-threatening infection, requiring several months of antibiotic treatment.
Treated with a combination of antibiotics including doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine for several months.

Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
WHAT TO KNOW
Classic CJD is a quick-moving, always fatal disease that occurs worldwide.
It affects the brain and causes dementia and other problems.
CJD mostly occurs in older adults.
There is no treatment or cure.
It usually leads to death within a year from when symptoms begin.
Overview
CJD is caused by a prion, a type of infectious protein. Prions trigger normal proteins in the body to misfold, leading to CJD.
CJD causes dementia and other neurologic problems. Once symptoms begin, it can lead to death in months to a year.
Classic CJD occurs worldwide in older adults, with the average age in the late 60s. Very few cases occur in people who are younger than 30 years old.
CJD occurs worldwide with an estimated rate of about one to two illness per one million population members per year. In recent years in the United States, about 500-600 cases have been reported per year.
Types
There are three main types of CJD infection:
Sporadic
The vast majority of all CJD cases reported (about 85 percent) are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the body misfold for some unknown reason. The result is disease that breaks down the brain's functions. Some cases are fatal within a few months of the first symptoms, and most are fatal within a year.
Familial
About 5-15 percent of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited a mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) who also has the disease would have familial CJD.
Iatrogenic
Iatrogenic cases are caused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or due to biological products. There have been six known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with prions is used on another patient.
People who received prion-contaminated human growth hormone prior to 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still being identified.
Finally, cases can occur in people who receive a transplant of specific materials. These include corneal (eye) grafts or dura mater (a membrane in the brain and spinal cord) grafts. If the donor had CJD that was not discovered before the donation, recipients can contract CJD.
How it affects your body
People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may include trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients usually die within one year following the onset of symptoms.
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers can diagnose an illness as a suspect case based on:
Symptoms and course of illness
Tests of a person's spinal fluid
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a brain scan
EEG, a test of electrical activity in the brain.
The only way to confirm CJD is through testing brain tissue from a biopsy or an autopsy.
Treatment and Prognosis
Classic CJD is always fatal, usually within a few months. There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the progression of disease. So, treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable.
Similar diseases
Though they have very similar names, CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are not the same disease. Both are prion diseases. However, variant CJD is tied to eating meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (sometimes called Mad Cow Disease). CJD, sometimes called ""classic CJD"" to avoid confusion, mostly occurs sporadically. Unlike variant CJD, classic CJD is not caused by any other prion disease.
In general, classic CJD affects people older than 55 while vCJD cases were younger, with an average age of 28. Classic CJD progresses much more quickly, causing death in an average of 4-5 months, while vCJD averages more than a year.

About Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)
KEY POINTS
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a rare disease caused by a prion, an infectious protein.
It is linked to eating beef from cows infected with ""mad cow disease.""
It is always fatal, usually within 14 months of the first symptoms.
vCJD illnesses have been very rare since the early 2000s.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
vCJD is a rare, fatal brain disease that occurs in people. It has been linked to eating meat from cows infected with another prion diseases, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). BSE is sometimes called ""mad cow disease.""
vCJD was first reported in the United Kingdom in 1996. Worldwide, there have been 233 people reported to have vCJD since its discovery. The vast majority of illnesses occurred in the United Kingdom in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There were also cases reported in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, the United States and Canada.
It can take years for someone to develop vCJD symptoms after they were exposed to BSE. But, once symptoms begin, it is always fatal. Most people with vCJD live with the illness for one to two years, with an average time of 13-14 months.
Signs and symptoms
As with other prion diseases, it takes a long time for people to get sick after contact with the prion. This timeframe can be 10 years or more.
People with vCJD have obvious psychiatric (mental, emotional, behavioral) symptoms. Often, this includes depression, anxiety and withdrawal.
They may also have a painful condition called dysesthesia. This may feel like itching, burning, pins and needles or other sensations on their body.
Later in the illness, patients typically have dementia and neurologic signs such as poor coordination.
Reported cases
Of the 233 vCJD illnesses reported since 1996, four vCJD illnesses have been reported in the United States. Three occurred between 2001 and 2006. A fourth had vCJD symptoms beginning in 2012.
It is believed that all four people with vCJD in the U.S. contracted the disease in another country. Two of the four patients had lived for decades in the United Kingdom. A third was born and raised in Saudi Arabia before coming to the United States. It's not clear where the fourth patient may have been exposed, but experts agreed it was likely outside the US.
A few more recent vCJD illnesses occurred in lab personnel and may have been exposed to prions in the lab.
Causes
There is strong evidence vCJD is caused when people eat meat from cows that were infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
BSE was first identified in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and cases peaked in the early 1990s. The first vCJD cases were reported in 1996.
Feeding cattle meat and bone meal from dead cows, some of which had BSE, contributed to the large U.K. outbreak.
Policies to prevent further exposure of animals and humans to BSE led to a dramatic decline in BSE cases. These included animal feed bans and the removal of infectious cattle tissues, such as the brain, from human food.
Scientists believe people may have eaten food potentially contaminated with BSE in the mid-1980s. vCJD cases started appearing about 10 years later. This matches the usual incubation period (the time between exposure and symptoms) for other prion diseases.
Prevention
Preventing vCJD primarily involves avoiding BSE. Given the how rare BSE is and protective measures in place, there are no specific vCJD prevention measures needed now.
Diagnosis
There is no specific test to diagnose vCJD while a patient is alive.
Healthcare providers look at a number of factors when deciding if someone has vCJD:
The patient's age
Their symptoms
Brain activity tests before death
Whether symptoms lasted more than one year
Whether another disease could have caused the illness.
To confirm the patient had vCJD, scientists must examine brain tissue gathered during an autopsy. They look for changes in the brain that are specific to vCJD.
Treatment
There is unfortunately no cure for vCJD. No specific therapy slows or stops the disease's progression once symptoms begin.
Treatment involves providing supportive care to help make the person more comfortable as their illness progresses.
Similar diseases
Though they have very similar names, vCJD is not the same disease as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The latter is often called ""classic CJD"" to avoid confusion.
Both are caused by prions, misfolded proteins that clump together in brain tissue. As they do, they cause brain damage. Over time, the brain damage gets worse, eventually causing the person's death.
Some of the differences between the two diseases include:
vCJD typically affects a much younger age group (average age 28 vs 68)
vCJD has different initial symptoms (psychiatric/behavioral vs dementia).
The two diseases affect the brain differently.
vCJD causes death > one year after illness onset (vs. 4-5 months for CJD)

MARCH 5, 2024
About Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever
KEY POINTS
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a rare, serious viral disease spread to humans by tick bites or infected animal blood.
CCHF is the most widespread viral hemorrhagic fever, found in Eastern and Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, northwestern China, central Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.
Healthcare workers and people in close contact with livestock are at higher risk for CCHF.
Overview
CCHF is caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which is spread by ticks. The CCHF virus can cause sudden illness. CCHF can spread between humans through contact with infectious blood or body fluids. It can result in severe bleeding and death. There's no cure for CCHF.
View Larger
The CCHF virus is present in the countries in red.
Healthcare providers:
Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like CCHF, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC
Signs and symptoms
CCHF symptoms usually appear suddenly and may include:
High fever
Severe headache
Back and joint pain
Stomach pain and vomiting
Red eyes and flushed face
Red spots on the roof of the mouth
Jaundice
Changes in mood and sensory perception
Agitation
Drowsiness
Bleeding
People with CCHF are usually sick for about two weeks. Around the fourth day of illness, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can develop.
Up to 50% of people hospitalized with CCHF will die.
How long it takes for signs to show
Symptoms can start 1-14 days after being exposed to the virus.
Risk factors
The following groups of people are at a higher risk of CHHF:
People in close contact with livestock in areas where CCHF is found
Healthcare workers caring for someone with CCHF without proper PPE
How it spreads
CCHF virus spreads through:
Tick bites from infected hard ticks (Ixodid)
Contact with blood or body fluids of infected animals or humans
Improperly sterilized medical equipment
Healthcare acquired infections are common.
Prevention
To prevent CCHF:
Use DEET-containing insect repellent to prevent tick bites.
Wear gloves, long sleeves, and pants when handling animals where CCHF is found.
Avoid contact with body fluids of potentially infected animals or people.
If CCHF is suspected and the patient is clinically stable: Healthcare providers should use PPE for clinically stable suspect VHF patients.
If CCHF is suspected and the patient is clinically unstable (for example, hemodynamic instability, vomiting) OR CCHF is confirmed regardless of clinical stability: Healthcare providers should use PPE for clinically unstable VHF patients.
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers diagnose CCHF with the following tests:
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Detection of antibodies in the blood
CCHF is a notifiable condition. Healthcare providers should notify their health department if they suspect a patient has CCHF.
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific treatment or cure for CCHF.
Supportive care includes fluid balance, giving oxygen, managing blood pressure, and treating other infections.
An antiviral called Ribavirin has shown some benefits in treating CCHF patients.
Recovery is slow, and the long-term effects are not well-studied.
More research is needed to determine the efficacy of ribavirin and other antiviral drugs in treating CCHF.
Vaccines
Currently, there is no widely available or approved vaccine for human use to prevent CCHF.
One type of vaccine is used on a small scale in Eastern Europe. However, more research is needed to determine the efficacy of this vaccine in preventing CCHF.

About Cronobacter Infection
KEY POINTS
Cronobacter is a germ that can live in dry foods like powdered infant formula, herbal teas, and starches, and in contaminated feeding items like breast pump equipment.
Cronobacter infections are rare but serious.
Cronobacter infections are most common in infants less than 2 months old and often cause death in this age group.
What It Is
Cronobacter sakazakii (or ""Cronobacter"") and other species are germs found naturally in the environment. Cronobacter can live in dry foods, like powdered infant formula, powdered milk, herbal teas, and starches. It has also been found in contaminated feeding items like breast pump equipment.
Cronobacter infections have been reported in all age groups. Getting sick from Cronobacter does not happen often, but infections in infants can be deadly. Infants less than 2 months old are most likely to develop meningitis (an inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine) if they are infected with Cronobacter bacteria. Infants born prematurely and those with weakened immune systems are also at risk for severe illness. Cronobacter infections in infants less than 12 months old are often linked to powdered infant formula. If you feed your baby powdered infant formula, you can take steps to protect your baby from sickness.
Quick facts
Cronobacter infection is rare. CDC typically receives reports of about 2 to 4 infections in infants per year, but Minnesota and Michigan were the only states that required reporting. Because most states did not require reporting, rates of Cronobacter infection in the United States are not well understood. However, a literature review from 1961 to 2018 provides evidence that Cronobacter infections are most common in infants less than 2 months old and often cause death in this age group. Also, infections among older adults may be more common, although milder, than infections among infants.
The true number of annual cases is unknown. However, invasive Cronobacter infections among infants have been added to the list of nationally notifiable conditions in 2024, requiring health providers to report diagnosed cases to state or local public health officials. This will help us learn more about the true number of cases that occur each year. Typically, CDC receives 2-4 reports of severe Cronobacter infections in infants annually from health departments and has received reports from 32 states. From January 2002 to July 2022, CDC received 76 reports of severe Cronobacter illnesses among infants. A recent report estimates that approximately 20% of infants with meningitis or bloodstream infections due to Cronobacter in the United States have died (Strysko, 2020). Worldwide, approximately 40% of infants reported to have Cronobacter meningitis or bloodstream infections have died (Strysko, 2020).

Contact your healthcare provider if you suspect that you have cryptosporidiosis. Most people with healthy immune systems will recover from cryptosporidiosis without treatment.
The best way to prevent the spread of Cryptosporidium in the home is by practicing good hygiene. Wash your hands at key times with soap and water, especially after using the toilet, after changing diapers, and before eating or preparing food, drinks, or ice.

Facts About TBI
KEY POINTS
A TBI affects how the brain works.
TBI is a major cause of death and disability.
TBIs may be missed in older adults.
A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems.
A TBI during childhood may affect brain development.
What it is
A TBI affects how the brain works
Doctor examines a brain using modern technology.
A traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is an injury that affects how the brain works. It may be caused by a:
Bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or
Penetrating injury (such as from a gunshot) to the head
There are three main types of TBI:
Mild TBI or concussion
Moderate TBI
Severe TBI
TBI is a major cause of death and disability
There were over 69,000 TBI-related deaths in the United States in 2021.1 That's about 190 TBI-related deaths every day.
TBIs affect the lives of people of all ages. Anyone can experience a TBI, but data suggest that some groups are at greater risk of dying from a TBI or experiencing long-term health problems after the injury.2 Examples of groups who are more likely to be affected by TBI, include:
Racial and ethnic minorities3
Service members and veterans4
People who experience homelessness5
People who are in correctional and detention facilities6
Survivors of intimate partner violence7
People living in rural areas8
Learn more about health disparities and TBI.
How TBIs happen
People most commonly get TBIs from a fall, firearm-related injury, motor vehicle crash, or an assault.
Research shows that:
Falls lead to nearly half of the TBI-related hospitalizations.9
Firearm-related suicide is the most common cause of TBI-related deaths in the United States.310
Motor vehicle crashes and assaults are other common ways a person may get a TBI.9
For more detailed information on the leading ways people get TBIs and the groups of people most likely to get a TBI, check out CDC's TBI data reports.
Populations
TBIs may be missed in older adults
Older adults are more likely to be hospitalized and die from a TBI compared to all other age groups.9 Still, TBIs may be missed or misdiagnosed in older adults because symptoms of TBI overlap with other medical conditions that are more common among older adults, such as dementia.
Healthcare providers should check for signs and symptoms of TBI if an older adult has:
Fallen or has a fall-related injury, such as a hip fracture.
Been in a car crash.
This is especially important among older adults who are taking blood thinners,11 such as:
Anticoagulants like warfarin (Coumadin), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis).
Antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), and acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin).
These medicines may increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following a TBI.11 Bleeding in the brain after a TBI may put a person at risk for more severe injury or death.
Potential effects of TBIs
A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems
Depending on the severity of the injury, those who get a TBI may face health problems that last a few days or the rest of their lives. For example, a person with a mild TBI or concussion may experience short-term symptoms and feel better within a couple of weeks or months. And a person with a moderate or severe TBI may have long-term or life-long effects from the injury.
A person with a possible TBI should be seen by a healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may have treatment to help speed your recovery.
Most people with a mild TBI or concussion can recover safely at home following a medical check-up.
People with a moderate or severe TBI may need ongoing care, such as rehabilitation services, to help with their recovery.
A TBI during childhood may affect brain development
TBI affects children differently than adults. An injury of any severity to the developing brain may:
Disrupt a child's development.
Limit their ability to participate in school and other activities, like sports.
As a result of a TBI, children may experience changes in their health, thinking, and behavior that affect learning, self-regulation, and social participation, all of which are important to becoming a productive adult.12
CDC's Report to Congress on the management of traumatic brain injury in children details the potential effects of a TBI on children and their families.12

SEPTEMBER 10, 2024
About Zoonotic Hookworm
KEY POINTS
Zoonotic hookworm is a parasite common in cats and dogs.
It lives in soil contaminated with animal feces (poop).
It burrows into people's skin, leaving red, itchy tracks.
Most people who are infected recover without treatment.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Zoonotic hookworms are parasites that normally live in animals like dogs or cats. However, they can spread to humans through the skin. When they infect people, the hookworms can cause a disease called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM).
People become infected when young hookworms, known as larvae, burrow into unprotected skin. This can happen when people are walking barefoot or sitting (with exposed skin) on soil or sand contaminated by animal feces.
Signs and symptoms
Zoonotic hookworm larva cause CLM by burrowing into the skin of a person's foot or body. This burrowing can cause:
Severe itching
Raised red lines on skin, also called tracks
These symptoms will go away after several weeks as the parasite dies.
In rare cases, some types of hookworm may infect deeper tissue in the intestine, lungs, or possibly the eye.
Risk factors
Cases of CLM often occur in people who have traveled to tropical regions where dog and cat hookworm larvae can survive in the soil.
If you walk barefoot in soil or sand in these regions, you can get zoonotic hookworm. However, you can find zoonotic hookworms anywhere in the world. In the United States, they're more common on the East Coast than the West Coast.
How it spreads
Animals infected with hookworm pass the parasites' eggs out of their body in their feces.
The eggs mature and hatch, releasing young hookworms, or larvae, into the soil or sand.
When you step on or sit in that soil with your bare skin, hookworm larvae can latch onto you and begin to burrow into your skin.
Prevention
Dispose of animal waste quickly to keep eggs from getting into soil and hatching.
Make sure dogs and cats get regular veterinary care, including deworming if needed.
Wear shoes and avoid skin contact with contaminated sand or soil.
If you travel to tropical or subtropical climates, especially where there are beaches, wear shoes and use protective mats or other coverings to keep your skin from touching sand or soil directly.
Diagnosis
If you have symptoms of CLM, speak with your healthcare provider. Your provider will examine your skin for itchy, red tracks made by hookworms, usually on the legs or feet.
There is no blood test for zoonotic hookworm infection. But your provider may ask you about recent travel and can help provide an accurate diagnosis.
Treatment
Most people with a zoonotic hookworm infection recover without medical treatment in 5 – 6 weeks, as the parasites that cause CLM die.
But in some cases, a healthcare provider might prescribe
Antiparasitic drugs to help kill hookworms
Antibiotics to help treat any bacterial infections in the damaged skin

Cyanide
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Cyanide is a fast acting and potentially deadly chemical.
Signs and symptoms of ammonia exposure depend on how much you were exposed to.
Get away from the area, get clean, and get medical care if exposed.
Background
Cyanide is a fast acting and potentially deadly chemical that affects the body's ability to use oxygen.
It comes from natural substances in some foods and in certain plants, including the pits and seeds of some common fruits.
Cyanide is sometimes described as having a ""bitter almond"" smell. It does not always give off a smell, and not everyone can smell it.
Types
Gas or liquid
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) - also known as ""AC"" in the military
Cyanogen chloride (CNCI) - also known as ""CK"" in the military
Solid (crystal)
Sodium cyanide (NaCN)
Potassium cyanide (KCN)
Uses of cyanide
Making paper, textiles and plastics
Developing photographs
Metallurgy
Includes electroplating, metal cleaning and removing gold from its ore
Killing pests and vermin
Signs and symptoms
Breathing in cyanide gas causes symptoms to show up the fastest, but swallowing solid or liquid cyanide can be dangerous too.
These symptoms can happen during or right after someone is exposed:
Chest pain and/or chest tightness
Dizziness, weakness, and/or confusion
Eye pain and/or eye tearing
Excitement
Restlessness
Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath or wheezing
Rapid or slow breathing
Rapid or slow heart rate
Headache
Nausea and/or vomiting
If exposed to large amounts, signs and symptoms include:
Coma
Death
High or low blood pressure
Loss of consciousness
Lung injury
Seizures
These symptoms can happen very quickly when exposed to a large amount of cyanide. These symptoms can happen with any type of exposure (breathing in, skin or eye contact, or swallowing).
Exposure
Water
If cyanide is in the water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the water.
Air
If cyanide is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the cyanide gas. If solid cyanide is put into water, it can make hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN or AC). This can increase chances of breathing in the gas.
Cyanide gas is most dangerous in enclosed places where gas will be trapped. Cyanide gas can spread quickly in open spaces depending on the weather. less harmful outdoors.
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN or AC) gas is lighter than air, so the gas will rise. Cyanogen Chloride (CNCl or CK) is heavier and will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there.
Cyanide in food
Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with cyanide can expose people to cyanide. This is more likely to happen with solid cyanide.
Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched liquid cyanide if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an cyanide release. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the cyanide was released and breathe fresh air.
If the cyanide release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the cyanide does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the cyanide was released.
If the cyanide release was indoors, get out of the building.
Resource
Make sure you understand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency broadcasts and local authorities for instructions.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. Showering is the best method for removing cyanide from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take your clothes off
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will prevent the cyanide from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
If you were exposed to solid cyanide, skip this step and wash your body as described in the next section.
If you were exposed to any form except solid cyanide, follow these steps to blot your body:
Use dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Use a different cloth or towel for each body part.
Start blotting with your head and hair.
Then blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds.
Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch cyanide. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.
Get help
To get help right away:
Call 911.
Go to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave.
Call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.
Treatment
The most important thing is for people to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.
If someone has swallowed cyanide, do not force vomiting.
Cyanide poisoning is treated with specific antidotes (treatment to reduce the effects of poison). Antidotes for cyanide poisoning are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.
It is also treated with supportive medical care in a hospital or by trained emergency personnel.
Long-term health effects
Survivors of large amounts of cyanide exposure may develop heart, brain, and nerve damage.
Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB)-Associated Illness
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
JANUARY 9, 2024
ESPAÑOL
Harmful Algal Blooms and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Harmful algal blooms are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria in water that can harm people, animals, or the environment.
Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick.
Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad.
Overview
Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or ""bloom."" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick.
What they look like
Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see.
A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red.
Keep Reading:
How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom
When they're harmful
Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they:
Make toxins
Become too dense
Use up oxygen in the water
Release harmful gases
Types
Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick.
Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers.
Dinoflagellates or diatoms are the most common causes of harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays.
Keep Reading:
Types of Harmful Algal Blooms
Where they're found
Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or brackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for recreation and for drinking.
Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United States, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
What causes them
Algae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a harmful algal bloom when water is:
Warm
Slow-moving
Full of nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorous
Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or runoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans. This can happen during rainstorms, for example.
Environmental changes, such as warmer water, might be making harmful algal blooms worse.
Learn more about factors that help harmful algal blooms grow.
Health impacts
Harmful algal blooms cause a variety of mild to serious illnesses. Symptoms depend on the type of harmful algal bloom you come in contact with and how you are exposed.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
Harmful agal blooms can be deadly for animals
Contact a veterinarian immediately if your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water. Animals can get very sick or even die within hours of coming into contact with harmful algae or cyanobacteria. Learn more about protecting pets and livestock.
Risk of exposure
People and animals can get sick from having contact with water or food that contains certain types of algae, cyanobacteria, or their toxins.
You or your animals can get sick if you:
Go in or near water contaminated by a harmful algal bloom
Swallow contaminated water
Eat contaminated shellfish or fish
Use contaminated blue-green algae dietary supplements
Keep Reading:
How People and Animals Get Sick From Harmful Algal Blooms
Preventing exposure
You can take steps to avoid getting sick from harmful algal blooms. For example:
Stay out of discolored, scummy, or smelly water and keep pets away.
Check for and follow swimming, fishing, and shellfish advisories.
Follow guidance from local officials if there is a harmful algal bloom in your drinking water supply.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
After exposure
If you or your animal go in water with an algal bloom, rinse off with tap water right after.
If you think you have symptoms caused by a harmful algal bloom, contact a healthcare provider or the Poison Control hotline
at 1-800-222-1222.
If your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water, contact a veterinarian right away. You can also call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center
at 1-888-426-4435 or the Pet Poison Helpline
at 1-855-764-7661. Note that there is a fee for these calls.
What CDC is doing
CDC works with federal, state, local, and territorial partners to reduce the health impact of harmful algal blooms. This includes:
Public health research
Tracking harmful algal blooms and illnesses
Developing methods to detect toxins
Outreach and education
Providing health departments with financial and technical support

Cystic echinocccosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a ~ – 7 millimeter long tapeworm found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic, CE causes harmful, slowly enlarging cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs that often grow unnoticed and neglected for years.
Alveolar echinococcosis
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, a ~1 – 4 millimeter long tapeworm found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs (definitive hosts). Small rodents are intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis. Although cases of AE in animals in endemic areas are relatively common, human cases are rare. AE poses a much greater health threat to people than CE, causing parasitic tumors that can form in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, AE can be fatal.

About Cystic Fibrosis
KEY POINTS
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes problems with breathing and digestion.
Women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy can be screened to see if they could have a child with CF.
Babies born in the U.S. are checked for CF soon after birth as part of newborn screening.
Available treatments can improve health outcomes for people with CF.
What it is
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes problems with breathing and digestion. CF affects about 35,000 people in the United States. People with CF have mucus that is too thick and sticky, which
blocks airways and leads to lung damage;
traps germs and makes infections more likely; and
prevents proteins needed for digestion from reaching the intestines, which decreases the body's ability to absorb nutrients from food.
CF affects many different organs in the body, making people with the disease more likely to develop other health conditions including diabetes
, cirrhosis (liver disease)
, arthritis, reflux
, hypersplenism
(overactive spleen), and osteoporosis
.
Signs and symptoms
Signs of CF include
salty-tasting skin
cough that doesn't go away, often with thick mucus or blood
wheezing or shortness of breath
frequent lung or sinus infections
nasal polyps
(growths in the nose)
poor growth or weight gain in childhood
greasy, bad-smelling stools or constipation
male infertility
Talk to your healthcare provider if you or your child shows signs of CF. A sweat test
or genetic testing might be needed. If you or your child have been diagnosed with CF, you can find a CF Care Center near you
.
Causes
CF results from genetic changes (mutations) in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene
, which has instructions for making the CFTR protein. Everyone has two copies of the CFTR gene, one copy inherited from their mother and one from their father. A person must have genetic changes in both copies of the CFTR gene to have CF. This means that parents who each have a genetic change in only one copy of the CFTR gene, and therefore do not have the disorder themselves, can together have a child with CF.
Screening
Carrier screening
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that carrier screening
for genetic disorders, including CF, be offered to anyone who is considering pregnancy or is currently pregnant. However, this carrier screening does not include all possible CF genetic changes. Because CF sometimes runs in families, if you have a family history of CF and decide to get screened, talk to your healthcare provider to make sure that you are tested for the genetic change that runs in your family. Your healthcare provider might refer you for genetic counseling and testing.
Newborn screening
All babies born in the United States are checked for CF soon after birth as part of newborn screening. Finding babies with CF early is important so that they can start treatment right away, which can help delay or prevent complications of the disorder. Some people with CF show signs of the disorder soon after birth, although in milder cases, signs might not be seen until adulthood.
Treatment
Available treatments can help people with CF live longer, healthier lives. Treatments
for CF focus on improving breathing and digestion, preventing and treating infections, and thinning mucus. Treatments include medicines, therapy to clear mucus out of the lungs, and in some cases, lung transplant. Pharmacogenomic approaches have led to the development of medicines that target the underlying cause of the disorder. Because different CFTR genetic changes have different effects on the CFTR protein, these medicines can only be used to treat people with certain CFTR genetic changes.

About Cysticercosis
KEY POINTS
Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae (young worms) of tapeworms.
You develop cysticercosis after swallowing tapeworm eggs.
Symptoms can occur months to years after infection
Overview
Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the parasite Taenia solium. This infection occurs after a person swallows tapeworm eggs. The larvae get into tissues such as muscle, brain, and eye, and form cysts called cysticerci. When cysts are found in the brain or central nervous system, it is called neurocysticercosis.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms depend on the location and number of cysts in your body. Symptoms can occur months to years after infection, usually when the cysts start dying.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Cysticercosis
How it spreads
You get cysticercosis when you swallow tapeworm (T. solium) eggs. The eggs are passed in the feces (poop) of someone with a tapeworm. Tapeworm eggs can get in or on food, water, or surfaces contaminated with feces. People swallow the eggs when they consume contaminated food or water or put contaminated fingers in their mouth. Autoinfection is when someone with a tapeworm infects themselves with tapeworm eggs. They can also infect others in the family. Eating pork cannot give you cysticercosis.

How Cysticercosis Spreads
Prevention
You can take steps to prevent cysticercosis.
Sanitation and hygiene precautions
Wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food.
Teach children the importance of handwashing to prevent infection.
Food precautions
Wash and peel fruits and vegetables before eating them.
Avoid food or water that may be contaminated.
When traveling in countries where the water supply may be unsafe, drink only
Bottled water
Water that has been boiled for one minute
Carbonated (bubbly) drinks in sealed containers
Diagnosis
If you think that you may have cysticercosis, please see your healthcare provider. They will ask you about:
Your signs and symptoms
Where you have traveled
Kinds of foods you eat
Diagnosing neurocysticercosis typically involves MRI or CT brain scans and sometimes blood tests. Blood tests might not show positive results in mild infections. If surgery is needed, a pathologist will examine the cyst for diagnosis.
See additional information on testing for intestinal tapeworm infections on the taeniasis site.
Treatment
Infections are generally treated with a combination of anti-parasitic drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgery is sometimes necessary to treat cysts depending on:
Location of the cyst
The patient's response to drug treatment
Amount of brain swelling
Treatment isn't always necessary for every case of cysticercosis. Even if you don't need treatment to kill the parasite, you may need treatment for the symptoms caused by the infection, such as medication to reduce seizures.

About Cystoisosporiasis
KEY POINTS
Cystoisosporiasis is an intestinal infection caused by microscopic parasite Cystoisospora belli.
This parasite used to be called Isospora belli.
It is usually spread when people consume contaminated food or water.
It is most common in tropical and subtropical areas.
Overview
Cystoisosporiasis is an intestinal disease caused by the microscopic parasite Cystoisospora belli. This is the same parasite that used to be called Isospora belli. The parasite can be spread by ingesting food or water that was contaminated with feces (stool) from an infected person.
Symptoms
The most common symptom is watery diarrhea. Other symptoms can include abdominal pain, cramps, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fever. If untreated, people with weak immune systems, such as people with AIDS, may be at higher risk for severe or prolonged illness.
How it spreads
People become infected by swallowing mature parasites, for example, by ingesting contaminated food or water. However, oral-anal contact with an infected person might pose a risk for transmission. Infected people shed the immature form of the parasite in their feces. The parasite usually needs about 1 or 2 days in the environment (outside of people) to mature enough to infect someone else. In some settings, the parasite might mature in less than a day.
Resource
DPDx - Cystoisospora life cycle
Prevention
Avoiding food or water that might be contaminated with stool may help prevent infection. As always, good handwashing and personal-hygiene practices should be followed. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food. Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.
Diagnosis
Cystoisospora is too small to be seen without a microscope. The infection is diagnosed by examining stool (fecal) specimens under a microscope. More than one specimen may need to be examined to find the parasite.
Treatment
The infection is treated with prescription antibiotics. The usual treatment is with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is also known as Bactrim*, Septra*, or Cotrim*. People who have diarrhea should also rest and drink plenty of fluids.

About Cytomegalovirus
KEY POINTS
Cytomegalovirus (pronounced sy-toe-MEG-a-low-vy-rus or CMV) is a common virus found in people of all ages.
A healthy person's immune system usually keeps the virus from causing illness.
Some babies born with CMV can have health problems at birth or that develop later.
MORE INFORMATION

Public Health
What it is
CMV is a common virus that infects people of all ages. In the United States, nearly 1 in 3 children is already infected with CMV by age 5. Over half of adults have been infected with CMV by age 40.
Once CMV is in a person’s body, it stays there for life and can reactivate. A person can also be re-infected with a different strain of the virus.
Signs and symptoms
Most people with CMV show no signs or symptoms and aren’t aware that they have been infected.
In healthy people
Sometimes, infection in healthy people can cause mild illness like:
Fever
Sore throat
Fatigue
Swollen glands
Occasionally, CMV can cause mononucleosis or hepatitis (liver problems).
In people with weakened immunity
If you have a weakened immune system and get CMV, you can have more serious symptoms affecting the eyes; lungs; liver; esophagus; stomach; and intestines.
In babies
Babies born with CMV can have brain, liver, spleen, lung, and growth problems. The most common long-term health problem in babies born with CMV infection is hearing loss. This may be detected soon after birth or may develop later in childhood.
Who is at risk
Anyone can get CMV. Some people are at higher risk for complications from CMV, like those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems.
If you are pregnant and infected with CMV, you can pass CMV to your developing baby. When a baby is born with a CMV infection, it is called congenital CMV.
About 1 in 200 babies is born with congenital CMV infection. About 1 in 5 babies with congenital CMV infection will have birth defects or other long-term health problems.
CMV is most common infectious cause of birth defects in the US.

CMV in Newborns
How it spreads
Children are a common source of CMV
The virus can stay in a child's body fluids for months after the infection. People who are often around young children are more likely to get infected.
People with CMV can pass the virus through body fluids, such as saliva, urine, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk.
An infected person can spread CMV:
From direct contact with saliva or urine, especially from babies and young children
Through sexual contact
From breast milk to nursing infants
Through transplanted organs and blood transfusions
During pregnancy
Prevention
You can lower your chances of getting CMV by reducing contact with saliva (spit) and urine from babies and young children. Make sure you:
Do not share food, utensils, cups, or pacifiers with a child.
Wash your hands with soap and water after changing diapers or helping a child to use the toilet.
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers can order blood tests to identify CMV infection in adults who have symptoms. However, blood is not the best fluid to test newborns with suspected CMV infection.
Saliva or urine tests are preferred for newborns. These tests must be done within 2 to 3 weeks of birth to confirm if the baby has congenital CMV.

Laboratory Testing for CMV and Congenital CMV
Treatment and recovery
Healthy people who are infected with CMV usually do not require medical treatment.
Medications called antivirals are available to treat:
CMV infection in people who have weakened immune systems.
Babies with signs of congenital CMV at birth.
Valganciclovir is an antiviral that might improve hearing and developmental outcomes in babies. It can have serious side effects and has only been studied in babies with signs of congenital CMV infection. There is limited information on the effectiveness of valganciclovir to treat infants with hearing loss alone.
Hearing checks and therapies can help
Children with congenital CMV should have regular hearing and vision checks. There are other services a child may need to help them develop strong language and communications skills.
CMV in newborns
What CDC is doing
CDC aims to reduce the burden of congenital CMV. We work closely with national experts to conduct research and increase awareness of CMV among the public and healthcare providers.
Specific activities include:
Research
Evaluating the various laboratory tests for newborn screening for CMV.
Determining the most effective screening approaches to identify babies with congenital CMV.
Characterizing the impact of the disease in various populations.
Assessing the long-term outcomes of children with congenital CMV.
Education
Updating our CMV website to include the latest information about congenital CMV.
Developing and disseminating communication resources to educate pregnant women, parents, and healthcare providers about congenital CMV.
Working with partners to ensure our messages about congenital CMV reach healthcare providers, pregnant women, and parents of children born with congenital CMV.
Promoting National CMV Awareness Month in June.
National CMV Awareness Month
In 2011, Congress passed a resolution naming June ""National CMV Awareness Month,"" to raise awareness about the most common infectious cause of birth defects. During this time, CDC offers resources to increase understanding of CMV and congenital CMV among healthcare providers, pregnant women, and parents.
