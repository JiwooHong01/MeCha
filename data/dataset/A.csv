About Aortic Aneurysm
KEY POINTS
An aortic aneurysm is a dangerous balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso.
What it is
Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:
The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms.
A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. An abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is more common, happens below the chest.
Facts about aortic aneurysm in the United States
Aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections were the cause of 9,904 deaths in 2019.1
In 2019, about 59% of deaths due to aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection happen among men.1
A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms.2
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms.3
Types
Thoracic aortic aneurysm
A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age.4
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:
Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back.
Shortness of breath.
Trouble breathing or swallowing.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people.5
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them.6
Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:
Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs.
Other types
Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms—those found in arteries other than the aorta—can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.
Risk factors
Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm.
Other factors include
High blood pressure
High blood cholesterol
Atherosclerosis (hardened arteries)
Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your risk.
Treatment and recovery
The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are medicines and surgery. Medicines can lower blood pressure and reduce risk for an aortic aneurysm. Surgery can repair or replace the affected section of the aorta.

CDC's Abortion Surveillance System FAQs
AT A GLANCE
Find frequently asked questions, data, reports, and findings from CDC's Abortion Surveillance System.
When did CDC abortion surveillance start?
CDC began abortion surveillance in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. Many states and jurisdictions conduct abortion surveillance. This information is voluntarily reported as aggregate data to CDC. CDC’s surveillance system compiles the information from states and jurisdictions on legal induced abortions.
How does CDC define abortion?
For the purpose of surveillance, legal induced abortion is defined as ""an intervention performed within the limits of state and jurisdiction law by a licensed clinician (for instance, a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) intended to terminate a suspected or known intrauterine pregnancy and that does not result in a live birth."" This definition excludes management of intrauterine fetal death, early pregnancy failure/loss, ectopic pregnancy, or retained products of conception. Most states and jurisdictions that collect abortion data report whether an abortion was performed by medication or surgery.
Are states and jurisdictions required to report their abortion data to CDC?
No, states and jurisdictions voluntarily report aggregate data to CDC for inclusion in its annual Abortion Surveillance report. CDC's Division of Reproductive Health prepares surveillance reports as data become available. There is no national requirement for data submission or reporting.
States and jurisdictions needing guidance on abortion surveillance may contact CDC at Contact CDC-INFO.
How is the report prepared and formatted?
Preparation of the Abortion Surveillance report is based on the data available from the states and jurisdictions that voluntarily provide this information for a given calendar year. After CDC receives the data, staff perform the analyses that produce the tables, the figure, and the narrative describing methods and trends. For more information on compilation of the report, please view the abstract and methods portion of the most recent Abortion Surveillance report.
How is the Abortion Surveillance Report used?
This report is used for many purposes in the field of public health, including to:
Evaluate programs aimed at promoting equitable access to patient-centered quality contraceptive services in the United States, to reduce unintended pregnancies.
Assess changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion over time, such as changes in method and gestational age at the time of abortion.
Estimate the number of pregnancies in the United States, using the number of pregnancies ending in abortion, in conjunction with birth data and estimates of pregnancy loss.
Are data available for my own analysis?
Besides the data available in the annual Abortion Surveillance report, data are also available for abortions distributed by area of residence and area of clinical service. These data are consistent with data reported to CDC for each year's Abortion Surveillance report. No additional data are available for public use. For other abortion data, search the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE/PubMed

About Child Abuse and Neglect
KEY POINTS
Child abuse and neglect are serious public health problems.
Child abuse and neglect can have long-term impacts on health, opportunity, and well-being.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
What are child abuse and neglect?
Child abuse and neglect includes all types of abuse and neglect of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (e.g., a religious leader, a coach, or a teacher) that results in harm, the potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.
There are four common types of abuse and neglect:
Physical abuse is the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical injury. Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, or other shows of force against a child.
Sexual abuse refers to any completed or attempted sexual acts or sexual contact with a child by a caregiver. Examples include fondling, penetration, and exposing a child to other sexual activities. Read more information about child sexual abuse.
Emotional abuse refers to behaviors that harm a child's self-worth or emotional well-being. Examples include name-calling, shaming, rejecting, and withholding love.
Neglect is the failure to meet a child's basic physical and emotional needs. These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, access to medical care, and having feelings validated and appropriately responded to.1
For more information about child abuse and neglect definitions please see Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements [4.12 MB, 148 Pages, 508].
Quick facts and stats
Child abuse and neglect are common. At least one in seven children experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States.2 This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported. In 2021, 1,820 children died of abuse and neglect in the United States.3
Children living in poverty experience more abuse and neglect. Experiencing poverty can place a lot of stress on families, which may increase the risk for child abuse and neglect. Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for children in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher socioeconomic status.
Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime economic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in 2018.4 This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.5
Outcomes
Children who are abused or neglected may suffer immediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones. They may also have emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety or posttraumatic stress.
Over the long term, children who are abused or neglected are also at increased risk for experiencing future violence victimization and perpetration, substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, delayed brain development, lower educational attainment, and limited employment opportunities.
Abuse and neglect may result in toxic stress, which can change brain development and increase the risk for problems like posttraumatic stress disorder and learning, attention, and memory difficulties.6
Prevention
Child abuse and neglect can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing child abuse and neglect.
Preventing child abuse and neglect requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence.7
Everyone benefits when children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments. We all have role to play.

About Abuse of Older Persons
KEY POINTS
Many older adults require care and are vulnerable to violence perpetrated by a caregiver or someone they trust.
More research is needed to uncover the causes for, and solutions to, violence against older adults.
What is older person abuse?
Older person abuse is an intentional act or failure to act that causes or creates a risk of harm to an older adult. An older adult is someone aged 60 or older.
The abuse occurs at the hands of a caregiver or other trusted person. Common types of abuse include:
Physical abuse is illness, injury, functional impairment, or death resulting from the intentional use of physical force. Examples include hitting, kicking, or pushing.
Sexual abuse is forced or unwanted sexual interaction. Examples include unwanted sexual contact or penetration or non-contact acts such as sexual harassment.
Emotional or psychological abuse refers to verbal or nonverbal behaviors that inflict anguish, fear, or distress. Examples include humiliation, threats, or harassment.
Neglect is the failure to meet an older adult's basic needs. These needs include food, water, shelter, clothing, hygiene, and essential medical care.
Financial abuse is the illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of money, benefits, property, or assets for the benefit of someone other than the older adult.
Quick facts and stats
The older adult population is growing faster in the U.S. than are younger populations. The data underestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older adults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn’t include those treated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, many cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, friends, or family about the violence.
Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home.1 From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000 homicides occurred.2
Compared with women, men had higher rates of both nonfatal assaults and homicides.23 The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% among men (2002–2016) and more than 35% among women (2007–2016). The estimated homicide rate for men increased 7% from 2010 to 2016.2 Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black or African American persons, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanic or Latino persons have higher homicide rates (2002–2016).2
Overall and firearm-specific older adult homicide rates increased between 2014 and 2017. Of the 6,188 victims, 62% were male. The perpetrator was an intimate partner in 39% of firearm homicides and 12% of non-firearm homicides. Common contexts of firearm homicides were familial or intimate partner problems, robbery or burglary, argument, and illness-related (e.g. the homicide was perpetrated to end the suffering of an ill victim, both victim and perpetrator had an illness, or the perpetrator had a mental illness).3
The economic cost of violent injuries against older adults is also substantial. A recent CDC study found that assault injuries to older adults in the United States cost almost $33 billion in 2022. This reflects a rise in both homicides and nonfatal assaults treated in emergency departments among older adults. Specifically, the rate of nonfatal assaults increased by 31%, while the rate of homicides rose by 26% between 2015 and 2022. 4
Outcomes
Abuse can have several physical and emotional effects on an older adult. Victims are fearful and anxious. They may have problems with trust and be wary of others.5
Many victims suffer physical injuries. Some are minor, like cuts, scratches, bruises, and welts. Others are more serious and can cause lasting disabilities. These include head injuries, broken bones, constant physical pain, and soreness. Physical injuries can also lead to premature death and make existing health problems worse.35678
Prevention
Violence against older adults can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing abuse. Preventing violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them violence.
We can all help prevent violence against older adults:9
Listen to older adults to understand their challenges and provide support.
Educate yourself and others about how to recognize and report abuse.
Learn how the signs of abuse differ from the normal aging process.
Check-in on older adults who may have few friends and family members.
Encourage or assist persons (caregivers or older adults) who have problems with drugs or alcohol in getting help.
It is also possible to provide over-burdened caregivers with support. This can include help from friends, family, or local relief care groups, adult day care programs, or counseling.
Knowledge about what works to prevent violence against older adults is growing. However, most prevention strategies and practices have not yet been rigorously evaluated to determine their effectiveness. In the absence of proven prevention strategies, program planners may consider the following sources to strengthen their approach: Applying the Principles of Prevention: What do Prevention Practitioners Need to Know About What Works
and What Works in Prevention: Principles of Effective Prevention Programs

About Abusive Head Trauma
KEY POINTS
Abusive head trauma is a leading cause of child abuse deaths in children under five.
Abusive head trauma can be prevented by understanding the dangers of shaking a baby and offering support to parents and caregivers.
What is abusive head trauma?
Abusive head trauma, including shaken baby syndrome, is a severe form of child abuse that results in a brain injury.12
It often happens when a parent or caregiver becomes angry or frustrated because of a child's crying.3 It is caused by violent shaking and/or with blunt impact. The resulting injury can cause bleeding around the brain or behind the eyes.2
Quick facts and stats
Crying, including long periods of inconsolable crying, is a normal behavior in infants. Shaking, throwing, or hitting a baby is never the right response to crying. Babies less than one year old are at the greatest risk of injury from abusive head trauma.43
In the United States, abusive head trauma:
Is a leading cause of child abuse deaths in children under five.5
Accounts for about one-third of all child maltreatment deaths.5
Outcomes
Nearly all victims of abusive head trauma suffer serious, long-term health consequences.6 7Examples include vision problems, developmental delays, physical disabilities, and hearing loss.7 8As many as one of every four babies who experience abusive head trauma dies from this form of child abuse.89
Prevention
Anyone can play a role in preventing abusive head trauma. It is important to understand that infant crying is worse in the first few months of life. However, it will get better as the child grows.
If you are a parent or caregiver
Trying calming a crying by swaddling in a blanket or holding your baby against your bare skin. Also consider offering a pacifier, rocking gently and singing or talking softly. If possible, you can try taking a walk with stroller or going for drive in the car.
If you are getting upset, focus on calming yourself down. Parenting is hard work! It's ok to ask for help. Put the baby in a safe place and walk away to calm down. Continue to check on the baby every five to 10 minutes. Consider calling a friend, relative, neighbor, parent helpline
, or your child's healthcare provider for support.
If the baby won't stop crying, check for signs of illness. Call the doctor if you think the child is sick. Never leave your baby alone with a person who is easily irritated, has a temper, or a history of violence.
If you are a friend, family member, or community member
Be aware of new parents in your family and community who may need help or support.
Offer to give a parent or caregiver a break when needed.
Encourage parents and caregivers to take a break if needed while the baby is safe in the crib.
Be sensitive and supportive in situations when parents are dealing with a crying baby.
Support work policies that make it easier for working parents to stay with their infants during the period of increased infant crying (i.e., between 4-20 weeks of age).

About Acanthamoeba Infections
KEY POINTS
Acanthamoeba is a free-living ameba, a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water, soil, and dust.
Most people will come into contact with Acanthamoeba at some point, but most won't get sick. Although rare, some people develop serious Acanthamoeba infections that are often fatal.
See a healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of an Acanthamoeba infection.
Overview
Most people will be exposed to Acanthamoeba during their lifetime. The ameba is found in soil and dust as well fresh water and saltwater. It can also be found in swimming pools, hot tubs, drinking water systems, humidifiers, and in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
Most people exposed to Acanthamoeba won't get sick. For others, it can cause serious infections of the brain, skin, eyes, and sinuses. Acanthamoeba can infect parts of the body through cuts or skin wounds or from being inhaled into the lungs or nostrils. It can get into the eyes through contact lens use.
Types
Non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections
High resolution of Acanthamoeba in a patient's brain
Non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections are rare but serious infections that can affect one or many parts of the body. These infections usually occur in people with weakened immune systems and include:
Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), which affects the brain and is almost always fatal
Cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, a skin infection
Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis, an infection of the nasal cavity and sinuses
Disseminated infection, which affects multiple parts of the body. GAE, cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, and Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis can all spread to cause disseminated infections.

Free-living amebas
A free-living ameba is a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water and soil around the world. Most people will come into contact with these amebas during their lives but won't get sick. Others will develop rare but serious infections.
Although there are several types of free-living amebas that live in the environment, three are known to cause severe disease in people:
Acanthamoeba
Balamuthia mandrillaris
Naegleria fowleri
All of these amebas can cause life-threatening brain infections. Some can also cause infections of the eyes, skin, sinuses, and other parts of the body.

Acinetobacter
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
APRIL 11, 2024
About Acinetobacter
KEY POINTS
Infections caused by Acinetobacter typically occur in healthcare settings.
Good hand hygiene and infection prevention practices can help reduce infection risk.
Acinetobacter germs can be resistant to antibiotics, making them difficult to treat.
What it is
Acinetobacter is a group of bacteria (germs) commonly found in the environment, like in soil and water. Infections caused by Acinetobacter rarely occur outside of healthcare settings.
Types
Germs in the Acinetobacter baumannii family account for most Acinetobacter infections in humans. This type is sometimes referred to as ""Acinetobacter baumannii complex.""
Signs and symptoms
Acinetobacter baumannii can cause infections in the blood, urinary tract, lungs (pneumonia) or wounds. In some cases, people can carry the bacteria without being infected, known as colonization.
At-risk populations
In the United States, patients in healthcare settings are at highest risk, especially those who:
Are on breathing machines (ventilators).
Have devices such as catheters.
Have open wounds from surgery.
Are in intensive care units.
Have prolonged hospital stays.
People who have weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or diabetes may be more susceptible.
How it spreads
Acinetobacter can spread in healthcare settings through:
Contact with contaminated surfaces.
Contact with contaminated equipment.
Person-to-person contact, often via contaminated hands.
Reducing risk
Patients and caregivers should:
Keep their hands clean by regularly washing their hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, including before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device.
Remind people (including healthcare providers) to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting.
Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Testing
To determine if someone has an Acinetobacter infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This test can also determine what treatment will work best.
Treatment
Acinetobacter infections are generally treated with antibiotics. To identify the best antibiotic to treat a specific infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory and test the bacteria against a set of antibiotics to determine which are active against the germ. The provider will select an antibiotic based on the test results and other factors, like potential side effects or interactions with other drugs.
Unfortunately, many Acinetobacter germs are resistant to multiple antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.
What CDC is doing
Providing testing to identify antimicrobial resistance cases, measure resistance and track transmission in a healthcare setting through the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network.
Tracking Acinetobacter infections through the Emerging Infections Program.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by Acinetobacter and slow the spread of resistant germs.

APRIL 17, 2024
ESPAÑOL
Chest Cold (Acute Bronchitis) Basics
KEY POINTS
Cough keeping you up at night? Soreness in your chest and feeling tired? You could have a chest cold, often called acute bronchitis.
A virus usually causes chest colds.
Antibiotics will not help you get better if you have a chest cold.
If you're healthy without heart or lung problems or a weakened immune system, this information is for you.
Overview
A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's what makes you cough.
Swelling of airways in the lungs produce mucus in the lungs and makes you cough.
Signs and symptoms
The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is coughing with or without mucus. Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include:
Soreness in the chest
Feeling tired (fatigue)
Mild headache
Mild body aches
Sore throat
Causes
A virus usually causes acute bronchitis. Bacteria can sometimes cause acute bronchitis.
Prevention
You can help prevent acute bronchitis by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including:
Clean your hands.
Get recommended vaccines, such as the flu vaccine.
Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
When to seek medical care
Temperature of 100.4 °F or higher.
Cough with bloody mucus.
Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.
Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks.
Repeated episodes of bronchitis.
This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning.
Talk to a healthcare provider right away
If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.
Treatment
Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own—without antibiotics. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.
How to feel better
Get plenty of rest.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.
Use saline nasal spray or drops to relieve a stuffy nose.
For young children, use a rubber suction bulb to clear mucus.
Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower.
Use throat lozenges or cough drops. Do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years of age.
Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older.
Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicines may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they will not cure your illness.
Over-the-counter medicine and children
Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Some over-the-counter medicines are not recommended for children of certain ages.
Pain relievers:
Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen.
Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain.
Cough and cold medicines:
Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children.
Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child's healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child.
Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking.
Similar diseases
Other illnesses like whooping cough (pertussis) or pneumonia can have similar symptoms to acute bronchitis. If you have whooping cough or pneumonia, your healthcare provider will most likely prescribe antibiotics.

About Adenovirus
KEY POINTS
Adenoviruses are common and typically cause mild cold or flu-like symptoms.
Adenoviruses can cause illness in people of all ages any time of year.
People with weakened immune systems or existing respiratory or cardiac disease are at higher risk of developing severe illness from adenovirus.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Symptoms
Adenoviruses can cause a wide range of signs and symptoms, such as:
common cold or flu-like symptoms
fever
sore throat
acute bronchitis (inflammation of the airways of the lungs, sometimes called a ""chest cold"")
pneumonia (infection of the lungs)
pink eye (conjunctivitis)
acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines causing diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain)
Less common symptoms include:
bladder inflammation or infection
neurologic disease (conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord)
How it spreads
Adenoviruses are usually spread from an infected person to others through:
close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands.
the air, by coughing and sneezing.
touching an object or surface with adenoviruses on it, and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands.
through an infected person's stool (e.g., during diaper changing).
through the water, such as swimming pools, but this is less common.
How long a person can spread the virus
Sometimes the virus can be shed (released from the body) for a long time after a person recovers from an adenovirus infection, especially among people who have weakened immune systems. This ""virus shedding"" usually occurs without any symptoms, even though the person can still spread adenovirus to other people.
Prevention
Follow simple steps to protect yourself and others
CDC recommends important steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a range of common respiratory viruses, including adenovirus.
Practice good hygiene (practices that improve cleanliness).
Find a list of EPA-registered disinfectants
that are effective at killing adenovirus. Disinfectants effective against norovirus should also be effective against adenoviruses.
Take steps for cleaner air.
When you may have a respiratory virus take steps to prevent spread.
Frequent handwashing is especially important in childcare settings and healthcare facilities.
Keep Reading:
Respiratory Virus Guidance
Maintain proper chlorine levels to prevent outbreaks
It is important to keep adequate levels of chlorine in swimming pools to prevent outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenoviruses. CDC's Healthy Swimming website provides more information on how to maintain healthy and safe swimming environments.
Treatment
There are no approved antiviral medicines and no specific treatment for people with adenovirus infection. Most adenovirus infections are mild and may be managed with rest and over-the-counter pain medicines or fever reducers to help relieve symptoms. Always read the label and use medications as directed.
If you have concerns, you should speak with your healthcare provider.
Adenovirus vaccine is for the U.S. military only
There is a vaccine for adenovirus types 4 and 7 that is used in military personnel who may be at higher risk for infection from these two adenovirus types. This vaccine contains live virus that can be shed in stool and potentially cause disease in other people if transmitted.
The safety and effectiveness of this vaccine has not been studied in the general population or in people with weakened immune systems, and it is not approved for use outside of the military.
There is currently no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public.
For more information about the vaccine, see Adenovirus Vaccine Information Statement (VIS).

About Teen Pregnancy
KEY POINTS
US teen birth rates have continued to decline since 1991.
Although US teen births are declining, the US teen birth rate is higher than in many other high-income countries.
US teen birth rates vary among different racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic groups.
Overview
The US teen birth rate (births per 1,000 females aged 15-19 years) has declined 78% from 1991 to 2021.
Teen birth rates declined from 15 births per 1,000 females in 2020 to 14 births per 1,000 females in 2021. This is a record low and a decrease of 7% from 2020.1
Reasons for the declines are not totally clear. Evidence suggests these declines are due to more teens abstaining from sexual activity, and more sexually active teens using birth control.2
Although steadily declining, the US teen birth rate is higher than in other high-income countries.3 Additionally, rates vary among different racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic groups.14
What the data show
Racial and ethnic disparities
The 2021 teen birth rates (births per 1,000 females aged 15-19)1 varied by race and ethnicity:
24 for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native females.
22 for non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander females.
22 for non-Hispanic Black females.
21 for Hispanic females.
9 for non-Hispanic White females.
2 for non-Hispanic Asian females.
Geographic and socioeconomic disparities
Geographic differences in teen birth rates persist, both within and across states.4
Teens in certain settings are at higher risk of teen pregnancy and birth than other groups. For example, women ever in foster care were more likely to have a teen birth than women who had never been in foster care.5
Social determinants of health (Healthy People 2030
)—such as community levels of high unemployment, low education, and low income—have been associated with higher teen birth rates.
Interventions that address socioeconomic conditions like these may play a critical role in addressing disparities observed in US teen birth rates.6
What CDC is doing
Quality sexual and reproductive health services, such as birth control and sexually transmitted infection services, are important for supporting adolescent health. However, best practice recommendations for these services are not always followed.
CDC supports the Quality and Access for Reproductive Health Equity (QARE, pronounced 'care') for Teens project. This project is led by the National Association of Community Health Centers, along with Cicatelli Associates (CAI). It aims to improve best practices in health center services and increase access to those services.

NOVEMBER 18, 2024
Medication Safety and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement.
An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat.
ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.
Why it's important
The number of ADEs can increase due to:
Development and use of new medicines.
Discovery of new uses for older medicines.
The aging American population.
Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.
Learning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.
More than 1.5 million emergency visits
Each year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.
Tips
Practice medication safety at home
Adults
Keep a list
Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements.
Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.
Follow label directions
Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.
Take medicine on time
Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime).
Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.
Turn a light on
Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake.
If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.
Ask questions
If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.
Get the tests you need
Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.
Children
Know the dose.
Always:
Read the label.
Follow directions.
Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.
Check the label
Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines.
Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient.
If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Use the right tool
If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one.
Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.
Get questions answered
If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.
Teach children
Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.
Lock the safety cap
Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.
Put medicines away
After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location.
Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.
What CDC is doing
Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies.
Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups.
Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.

About the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
AT A GLANCE
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is one of several different systems CDC uses to monitor the safety of vaccines.
VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event).
Anyone — patients, family members, healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers — can submit a report to VAERS. Healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers are legally required to report certain events after vaccination.
A report to VAERS does not mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event.
If it looks as though a vaccine might be associated with a health problem, CDC and FDA investigate further and take action if needed.
Overview
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS
) is the nation's early warning system that monitors the safety of FDA-approved vaccines and vaccines authorized for use for public health emergencies. The system accepts and analyzes reports of possible adverse events after vaccination and is co-managed by CDC and FDA. The number of reports submitted varies each year. VAERS accepts reports regardless of seriousness or how likely the vaccine may have caused the adverse event.
A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event.
A VAERS report alone does not indicate whether a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event. Only scientists and public health professionals can make this determination after thorough investigation.
Most VAERS reports involve mild side effects such as fever, arm soreness or mild irritability. Federal law defines reports of certain adverse events as serious reports. These include reports of the following after vaccination:
Permanent disability.
Hospitalization.
Extension of an existing hospitalization.
Life-threatening illness.
Congenital (present at birth) deformity/birth defect.
Death.
VAERS staff attempt to collect additional information from healthcare providers and clinicians about adverse events described in serious reports. While serious adverse events can happen after vaccination, they are rarely caused by the vaccine.
Report an adverse event to VAERS
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS. Learn more about which adverse events to report and how to report them.
VAERS: Access and Use
What data VAERS collects
The type of vaccine received.
The date of vaccination.
When the adverse event began.
Current illnesses and medications.
Medical history.
Past history of adverse events following vaccination.
Demographic information.
How data collection works
VAERS is a passive surveillance system, meaning it relies on people sending in reports of their experiences after vaccination.
Keep Reading:
About CDC’s Vaccine Safety Monitoring Program
How the data are used
CDC and FDA use VAERS reports to:
Assess the safety of newly licensed or authorized vaccines.
Detect new, unusual or rare adverse events that happen after vaccination.
Monitor increases in known side effects, like arm soreness where a shot was given.
Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of health problems related to vaccines.
Identify and address possible reporting clusters.
Recognize safe-use problems and administration errors.
Watch for unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports.
Serve as a vaccine safety monitoring system in public health emergencies.
Add to and improve scientific literature
and understanding of vaccine safety monitoring.
Signals
Patterns or an unusually high number of adverse events reported for a vaccine are called ""signals."" If they detect a signal, scientists may conduct further studies in VSD or CISA to find out if it represents an actual risk. CDC and FDA investigate further and act if needed.
Strengths and limitations of VAERS data
When evaluating VAERS data, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations.
Strengths
VAERS accepts reports from anyone. This also allows VAERS to act as an early warning system to detect rare adverse events.
VAERS collects information about the vaccine, the person vaccinated, and the adverse event. Scientists obtain follow-up information on serious reports.
All data from the initial VAERS report (without identifying patient information) are available to the public.
Limitations
VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected. Instead, someone who had or is aware of an adverse event following vaccination must file a report.
Anyone can submit VAERS reports. Some reports can lack details or contain errors. After investigation, scientists find that most events reported to VAERS are not associated with vaccination.
The number of reports submitted to VAERS can change in response to media attention and public awareness. Such changes in reporting can complicate interpretation of VAERS data.
When more people hear about vaccine side effects, they may report any health outcomes they experience after vaccination.
This increase in reporting can complicate detecting patterns of adverse events that should be further assessed in a strong, reliable data analysis system.
Such increased reporting can also create the misconception that vaccines are dangerous, leading to fear and hesitation about vaccination.
It is usually not possible to use VAERS data to calculate how often an adverse event occurs in a population.
The number of people receiving a vaccine is usually not available (a notable exception was during the COVID-19 public health emergency when the number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered was reliably reported to CDC).
VAERS data alone cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event. Establishing a causal relationship requires rigorous scientific assessment and consideration of multiple factors beyond just VAERS reports alone.
A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event
VAERS accepts all reports of adverse events following vaccination without judging whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. Some VAERS reports might represent true vaccine reactions or side effects; others might be coincidental adverse events not related to vaccination.
This limitation has caused confusion about the publicly available data.

NIOSH offers guides and tools to keep workers safe from harmful aerosols.
Overview
An aerosol may be defined as a suspension of particles or droplets in air. Aerosols may include airborne dusts, mists, fumes, or smoke. Suspended particle sizes may range from a few nanometers (nm) to hundreds of micrometers (µm) in diameter. For comparison a human hair may be between 20 to 180 µm in diameter. Particles can be manufactured or naturally occurring.
A welder can potentially be exposed to welding fumes.
Aerosols in the workplace may pose both health and safety hazards. Aerosols are encountered across multiple industry sectors. Particles can be inhaled, absorbed by the skin, enter the eyes or be ingested. Factors such as particle size, composition, shape, and concentration, can determine whether particles can cause harm to workers. Harmful effects can be either short or long term. Safety hazards may include slips, fires, or explosions.
NIOSH has carried out extensive aerosol research in exposure assessment, epidemiology, toxicology, risk mitigation, aerosol sampling and method development. This assists our understanding in:
How aerosols are formed and transported through the workplace.
Which workers may be most impacted and to what extent.
The health implications to workers.
The safety implications in the workplace.
How to sample for and measure aerosols in the workplace.
How to reduce or eliminate the health and safety hazards.
NIOSH recommends using the Hierarchy of Controls in reducing or eliminating hazards in the workplace.

About Productive Aging and Work
KEY POINTS
Aging is a process experienced by all workers.
Older workers are a large and growing part of the workforce.
An age-friendly workplace benefits all workers, but especially older workers.
Overview
Aging is a process experienced by all workers. For many older adults, work provides economic security and social interaction, and improves quality of life.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021 nearly one in four American workers was age 55 or older. Labor force participation rates for older workers are projected to increase through 2030. Participation rates for workers of other age groups are projected to remain relatively level or decline. It is important to support and protect the health and safety of workers, especially those of advanced age.
Attributes of productive aging
A life-span perspective views aging as an adaptive and dynamic process. Aging impacts your body, your mind, and how you interact with the world around you.
Changes that occur as workers age do not take place in a vacuum. In the workplace, the following factors play a role in productive aging:
The nature of work and its structure
Workplace relationships
Work-related events, like career progression and retirement
Ageist beliefs that may interfere with support of productive aging
Benefits of an aging workforce
Aging workers may provide the following benefits to their workplaces:
Institutional knowledge
Applicable experience
Low levels of stress on the job
Get along well with their coworkers
Cautious on the job
Health, safety, and aging
Aging affects a variety of health conditions and outcomes, including chronic conditions and the likelihood of workplace injury.
Chronic conditions and aging
More than 75% of all workers have at least one chronic condition. The two most common health conditions affecting older workers are arthritis and hypertension. Nearly half of workers over age 55 experience at least one of these conditions.
Since many older workers experience chronic conditions, they may be absent from work. On the other hand, there may be an increase in ""presenteeism."" Presenteeism is when workers show up to work sick.
Safety and aging
Overall, older workers tend to experience fewer workplace injuries than their younger colleagues. This difference may be due to their experience or because they are more careful and aware of their physical limitations.
Older workers often require more time to heal from workplace injuries. It is important for employers to have a well-planned return to work program.
Older workers experience a higher rate of workplace fatalities. Employers need to be mindful of how best to adapt the conditions of work to protect workers. They should also explore opportunities for preventative programs that can maintain or build the health of employees through their working life.
Recommendations
Creating an age-friendly workplace
Many age-friendly work practices benefit workers of all ages. Managers can create age-friendly workplaces by:
Prioritizing workplace flexibility and matching tasks to abilities.
Give workers a say in their schedule and work tasks.
Use self-paced work, rest breaks, and less repetitive tasks.
Provide reasonable accommodations after illness or injury.
Avoid prolonged, sedentary work.
Managing hazards like noise, slip/trip hazards, and physical hazards.
Providing and designing ergonomic-friendly work environments.
Providing health promotion and lifestyle interventions.
Investing in training and building worker skills and competencies.
Help older employees learn and adapt to new technologies.
Providing age-inclusive management training for supervisors.
What's being done
Comprehensive and integrated strategies
Programs to improve productive aging need to be multi-dimensional and well-coordinated. Work Ability and Total Worker Health® provide useful frameworks for productive aging by emphasizing sustainable strategies.
Work Ability is a worker's capacity to continue working in their current job. It considers work demands and available resources. Work demands include work organization, supervision, time pressures, and fatiguing work. Resources include health and abilities, job skills, autonomy, and support from your supervisor/colleagues/family.
Strategies to maintain or improve work ability focus on:
Working Conditions: including ergonomics and safety)
Employee Health: including safety, health, and well-being)
Professional Skills: maintaining and developing knowledge and skills
Psychosocial Factors:how employees experience and react to
Organizational policies and practices
How their work is designed
Inter-personal relationships at work
Carefully plan and implement programs or interventions and target several of the factors above.
Total Worker Health (TWH) integrates workplace safety interventions with activities that advance well-being. A TWH approach comprehensively addresses:
Safety
The control of psychosocial hazards and exposures
The organization of work
Outcomes and prioritizing workers
A productive aging approach targets outcomes that are important to workers and to organizations, understanding that each can influence the other.
Worker-centered outcomes
Individual physical and mental health
Safe work environment
Job satisfaction
Ability to meet needs outside of work
Organization-centered outcomes
Lower healthcare costs
Reduced injuries and workers' compensation costs
Low turnover and absenteeism
Productivity
Worker-centered and organization-centered outcomes can affect each other. For example, improving worker well-being provides organizational benefits like:
Reduced absenteeism
Higher productivity
Fewer reported workplace injuries
Organizations that transfer knowledge between older and younger workers through mentoring and reverse mentoring programs may increase:
Skills and collaborations
Productivity
Engagement
Focusing on both worker-centered and organization-centered outcomes can contribute to a sustainable culture of health.
Work culture that supports age differences
Age-related differences between generations can include:
Attitudes toward work and supervision
Communication style
Training needs
Work habits
Creating a culture supportive of productive aging involves:
Understanding the age composition of your workforce.
Discussing generational and age diversity issues.
Developing programs and policies that address the needs of all workers.
For example, family leave policies that appeal to young and older workers.
Encouraging positive interactions between different age groups.
For example, mentoring and reverse mentoring programs.
This culture should recognize and use the unique skills, knowledge, and perspectives of workers in all age groups.

Agriculture Worker Safety and Health
KEY POINTS
Agricultural workers are at increased risk for on-the-job injuries and deaths.
NIOSH created an agricultural safety and health program to address the risk of injuries and illnesses experienced by agricultural workers and their families.
Quick facts and stats
Injuries
Between 2021-2022, there were 21,020 injuries in agricultural production that required days away from work. There is well-known underreporting of injuries in this industry.1
Almost one-third (29%) of injuries in agricultural production that required days away from work from 2021-2022 were from falls.1
In 2014, An estimated 4,000 youth were injured while working on a farm.2
Deaths
In 2022, workers in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry had one of the highest fatal injury rates (18.6 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalents), compared to 3.7 deaths per 100,000 FTE for all U.S. industries.3
Transportation incidents were the leading cause of death for these farmers and farm workers. Other leading causes were violence by other persons or animals and contact with objects and equipment.3
In 2022, over half (56%) of deaths in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting industry occurred to workers 55 years of age and older.4
Who is at increased risk
In 2023, approximately 2.3 million workers were employed in agriculture and related industries in the U.S.5
The average age of all U.S. farm producers in 2022 was 58.1 years, up 0.6 years from 2017, continuing a long-term trend of aging in the U.S. producer population.6
An estimated 893,000 youth under 20 years of age lived on farms in 2014, with just over half (51%) also performing work on the farm.
An estimated 266,000 youth were hired to work on U.S. farms in 20147.
What's being done
In 1990, NIOSH developed an agricultural safety and health program to address the high risks of fatal injuries and illnesses experienced by workers and families in agriculture.
NIOSH supports extramural research and prevention programs at 12 Centers for Agricultural Safety and Health. These programs conduct research on injuries related to agriculture as well as pesticide exposure, respiratory health, musculoskeletal disorders, underserved populations, and mental health.

Agricultural Water and Your Safety
KEY POINTS
Agricultural water is essential for growing produce and can come from a variety of sources, like surface water, ground water, or municipal water systems.
Contaminated agricultural water poses risks to both crops and animals, potentially causing foodborne illness in people who consume fruits or vegetables exposed to it.
Overview
Agricultural water is water that is used to grow fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables. Agricultural water can be used for irrigation, pesticide and fertilizer applications crop cooling, frost control, harvesting, and processing.
Agricultural water is primarily utilized for irrigation purposes. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), irrigation water ranks as the second largest consumer of water, closely following thermoelectric power, and nearly three times the amount used for public water supply.1
Where it's found
Agricultural water is derived from diverse sources. Municipal water systems, both in urban and rural areas, can also be used for agricultural purposes. Typical sources of agricultural water include:
Surface water
Rivers, streams, and irrigation ditches
Open canals
Impounded water bodies like ponds, reservoirs, and lakes
Ground water
Springs
Wells
Possible health impacts
Contaminated agricultural water can pose significant health risks to both consumers and livestock.
Potential health effects include:
Foodborne illnesses
Gastrointestinal infections
Chronic health conditions
Prevention
The quality of agricultural water is important for public health. Proactive measures, such as effective planning and management of agricultural facilities, monitoring of water quality, and educating farmers about responsible irrigation practices, are essential. These preventive measures can help ensure the safety of agricultural water, protect the quality of food crops, and reduce waterborne and foodborne illnesses in the public.

Air Pollutants
WHAT TO KNOW
Outdoor air quality has improved since the 1990s, but many challenges remain in protecting Americans from air quality problems.
The EPA regulates six pollutants as “criteria” air pollutants. It regulates them using human health-based and environmentally based criteria. Ground-level ozone and particle pollution are two of these criteria pollutants. The other pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides.

Additional information on ozone & particulate matter
Ozone
If you have a respiratory condition like asthma or COPD, ozone can make your symptoms worse. Carefully follow your asthma action plan when ozone levels are high.
Ozone has been linked to:
Coughing and pain when taking a deep breath
Lung and throat irritation
Wheezing and trouble breathing during exercise or outdoor activities
Ozone can affect anyone, but it bothers some people more than others. People most likely to be bothered by ozone include:
People with asthma or other lung diseases
Older adults
People who exercise or work hard outside
Babies and children
When the Air Quality Index
predicts ground-level ozone levels will be high, follow these steps:
Spend more time indoors, where ozone levels are usually lower.
Choose easier outdoor activities (like walking instead of running) so you don't breathe as hard.
Plan outdoor activities at times when ozone levels are lower (usually in the morning and evening).
Particle Pollution (Particulate Matter)
Particle pollution, also called particulate matter, is made up of particles (tiny pieces) of solids or liquids in the air. These particles include:
Dust
Dirt
Soot
Smoke
Drops of liquid
Some particles are big enough or dark enough to see, like smoke. Others are so small that you can't see them.
Breathing in particle pollution can be harmful to your health. Larger particles, called PM10, irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. Dust from roads, farms, dry riverbeds, construction sites, and mines are types of PM10.
Smaller particles, called PM2.5, are more dangerous because they can get into the deep parts of your lungs — or even into your blood.
Particle pollution can affect anyone, but it bothers some people more than others. People most likely to be bothered by particle pollution include:
People with lung diseases like asthma or COPD
People with heart disease
People with diabetes
Older adults
Babies and children
If you have asthma, particle pollution can make your symptoms worse. Carefully follow your asthma action plan on days when pollution levels are high.
Particle pollution has been linked to:
Eye irritation
Lung and throat irritation
Trouble breathing
Lung cancer
Heart attacks and other forms of heart disease
Problems with babies at birth, like low birth weight
When the Air Quality Index
predicts particulate pollution levels will be high, follow these steps:
Spend more time indoors, where particle pollution levels are usually lower.
Choose easier outdoor activities (like walking instead of running) so you don't breathe as hard.
Avoid busy roads and highways where PM is usually worse because of emissions from cars and trucks.
Saharan dust
one type of particulate pollution
Saharan dust comes from the Sahara Desert in Northern Africa. Thunderstorms and cyclones produce high-speed winds that lift the dust and transport it thousands of miles.
Saharan dust transported to the United States usually peaks from late June through mid-August. In the United States, the dust mainly affects Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and southern states including Florida and Texas.

Air Quality Index scale
The AQI is easy to use. If the AQI predicts a ""Code Orange"" (unhealthy for sensitive groups) day don't cancel your plans—use the AQI to help you plan a better time or place for them.
The AQI tells you about major air pollutants in the U.S. that are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, including ozone and particle pollution. Ozone and particle pollution may harm the health of hundreds of thousands of Americans each year.
Ozone and particle pollution
Let's say that the ozone level where you live is predicted to be Code Orange tomorrow. If you're a runner—even if you're healthy—that air quality could hurt you. Using the AQI, you can plan your run for when ozone levels will be lower, shorten your run or walk instead, or run on a treadmill indoors.
Particle pollution has been linked to heart attacks and strokes, and even death in people with heart disease. On a day when particle pollution will be at Code Orange, do something less intense. Walk instead of run or do only lighter outdoor work.
Use the AQI Wherever You Go
Don't forget to check the AQI when you're on vacation or travelling within the U.S. No matter where you go, you can always access the AQI.

About Alcohol Use During Pregnancy
KEY POINTS
Alcohol use can be harmful during pregnancy.
There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy.
There is no safe time during pregnancy to drink alcohol.
All types of alcohol can be harmful, including red or white wine, beer, and liquor.
MORE INFORMATION

Health Care Providers
Why it's important
Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause a range of lifelong behavioral, intellectual, and physical disabilities known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).

During pregnancy, alcohol can pass from the pregnant woman to the fetus and affect its development. Not all babies will be affected by alcohol during pregnancy. However, it is impossible to know which babies will be affected.
There is no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol can cause problems for the baby throughout pregnancy, including before a woman knows she is pregnant. Alcohol use in the first 3 months of pregnancy can cause the baby to have abnormal facial features. Growth and central nervous system problems (for example, low birthweight, behavioral problems) can occur from alcohol use anytime during pregnancy. The baby's brain is developing throughout pregnancy and can be affected by exposure to alcohol at any time.
It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Stopping alcohol use will improve the baby's health and well-being.
There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy.
Common questions
I just found out I'm pregnant. I've stopped drinking now, but I was drinking in the first few weeks before I knew I was pregnant. What should I do now?
The most important thing is that you have completely stopped alcohol use after learning of your pregnancy. It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Because brain growth takes place throughout pregnancy, stopping alcohol use will improve the baby's health and well-being. Make sure you get regular prenatal checkups.
If you used any amount of alcohol while you were pregnant, talk with your child's healthcare provider as soon as possible and share your concerns.
I drank wine during my last pregnancy and my baby turned out fine. Why shouldn't I drink again during this pregnancy?
Every pregnancy is different. Alcohol use during pregnancy might affect one baby more than another. You could have one child who is born healthy and another child who is born with problems. There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during your pregnancy or when you are trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy.
What CDC is doing
CDC works with partners across the country to address alcohol and other substance use during pregnancy and FASDs. These scientific findings help inform evidence-based care and resources. They collaborate to provide training to healthcare professionals and disseminate updated information.

About Underage Drinking
KEY POINTS
Alcohol is the most common drug used by people younger than 21 in the United States.
Young people who drink alcohol are more likely to develop certain physical and mental health conditions.
Facts
About 4,000 young people (under 21) die from excessive alcohol use each year.A1
These deaths, which could have been prevented, take the lives of young people too soon.
Underage drinking cost the United States $24 billion in 2010 (the most recent year of data available).B2
Effects of underage drinking
Alcohol is the most common drug that young people use in the United States.3
Young people who drink alcohol are more likely to engage in risky behaviors that can lead to injuries and other health conditions. They're also more likely to experience social, academic, and legal issues.
Social, academic, and legal issues:
More school absences.
Lower grades.
Drinking and driving, which puts the safety of those who drink—as well as those around them—at risk.
Misusing prescription drugs or using illicit drugs—there can be serious health effects when using these drugs with alcohol.
Physical and mental conditions:
Violence, including homicide, suicide, and sexual violence.
Injuries including alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes, burns, falls, or drowning.
Not growing as expected.
Slower brain development—which may cause problems with memory.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and unplanned pregnancy—which can result from sex without protection.
Protection includes using condoms or taking medicine to prevent STIs, HIV, or pregnancy.
Lastly, people who start drinking earlier in life have a higher risk of using alcohol excessively or developing alcohol use disorder later in life.
What the data show
Adult alcohol use can increase underage drinking
Adolescents tend to drink if the adults around them drink or binge drink alcohol.
For example, a study showed that adolescents whose parents drank 5 or more days in a month were significantly more likely to drink alcohol than adolescents whose parents didn't drink.4
Adolescents are more likely to drink alcohol if their parents binge drink.

About Alcohol Use During Pregnancy
KEY POINTS

All types of alcohol can be harmful, including red or white wine, beer, and liquor.
MORE INFORMATION

Health Care Providers
Why it's important
Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause a range of lifelong behavioral, intellectual, and physical disabilities known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).

During pregnancy, alcohol can pass from the pregnant woman to the fetus and affect its development. Not all babies will be affected by alcohol during pregnancy. However, it is impossible to know which babies will be affected.
There is no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol can cause problems for the baby throughout pregnancy, including before a woman knows she is pregnant. Alcohol use in the first 3 months of pregnancy can cause the baby to have abnormal facial features. Growth and central nervous system problems (for example, low birthweight, behavioral problems) can occur from alcohol use anytime during pregnancy. The baby's brain is developing throughout pregnancy and can be affected by exposure to alcohol at any time.
It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Stopping alcohol use will improve the baby's health and well-being.
There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy.
Common questions
I just found out I'm pregnant. I've stopped drinking now, but I was drinking in the first few weeks before I knew I was pregnant. What should I do now?
The most important thing is that you have completely stopped alcohol use after learning of your pregnancy. It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Because brain growth takes place throughout pregnancy, stopping alcohol use will improve the baby's health and well-being. Make sure you get regular prenatal checkups.
If you used any amount of alcohol while you were pregnant, talk with your child's healthcare provider as soon as possible and share your concerns.
I drank wine during my last pregnancy and my baby turned out fine. Why shouldn't I drink again during this pregnancy?
Every pregnancy is different. Alcohol use during pregnancy might affect one baby more than another. You could have one child who is born healthy and another child who is born with problems. There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during your pregnancy or when you are trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy.

Harmful Algal Blooms and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Harmful algal blooms are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria in water that can harm people, animals, or the environment.
Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick.
Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad.
Overview
Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or ""bloom."" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick.
What they look like
Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see.
A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red.
Keep Reading:
How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom
When they're harmful
Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they:
Make toxins
Become too dense
Use up oxygen in the water
Release harmful gases
Types
Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick.
Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers.
Dinoflagellates or diatoms are the most common causes of harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays.
Keep Reading:
Types of Harmful Algal Blooms
Where they're found
Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or brackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for recreation and for drinking.
Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United States, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
What causes them
Algae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a harmful algal bloom when water is:
Warm
Slow-moving
Full of nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorous
Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or runoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans. This can happen during rainstorms, for example.
Environmental changes, such as warmer water, might be making harmful algal blooms worse.
Learn more about factors that help harmful algal blooms grow.
Health impacts
Harmful algal blooms cause a variety of mild to serious illnesses. Symptoms depend on the type of harmful algal bloom you come in contact with and how you are exposed.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
Harmful agal blooms can be deadly for animals
Contact a veterinarian immediately if your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water. Animals can get very sick or even die within hours of coming into contact with harmful algae or cyanobacteria. Learn more about protecting pets and livestock.
Risk of exposure
People and animals can get sick from having contact with water or food that contains certain types of algae, cyanobacteria, or their toxins.
You or your animals can get sick if you:
Go in or near water contaminated by a harmful algal bloom
Swallow contaminated water
Eat contaminated shellfish or fish
Use contaminated blue-green algae dietary supplements
Keep Reading:
How People and Animals Get Sick From Harmful Algal Blooms
Preventing exposure
You can take steps to avoid getting sick from harmful algal blooms. For example:
Stay out of discolored, scummy, or smelly water and keep pets away.
Check for and follow swimming, fishing, and shellfish advisories.
Follow guidance from local officials if there is a harmful algal bloom in your drinking water supply.

VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
FEBRUARY 6, 2024
Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever Basics
KEY POINTS
Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is a serious, and sometimes deadly disease.
AHF is caused by infection with the AHF virus spread by ticks in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
There is no known spread of AHF between people.
There is no treatment for AHF.
To protect yourself, avoid tick bites and touching infected animals in areas where AHF occurs.
Overview
Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is caused by a virus usually spread by ticks. Infections are rare but can be fatal. Since AHF was discovered in 1995, several hundred cases have been reported. AHF cases seem to peak in spring and summer. More research is needed.
AHF has been found in Saudi Arabia and Egypt
Signs and symptoms
Early symptoms of AHF resemble the flu. These symptoms include:
Fever
Loss of appetite
General malaise
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Sometimes, more severe symptoms can develop:
Brain swelling
Confusion
Neck stiffness
Coma
Bleeding
Multi-organ failure
Low platelet count
Low white blood cell count
Elevated liver enzymes
How long it takes for signs to show
Symptoms can start 2-4 days after being exposed to the virus.
Risk factors
People may be at risk of AHF if they experience any of the following in areas where the virus is found:
Tick bites
Contact with livestock and domestic animals, like camels, in tick-infested areas
Crushing infected ticks with bare or unprotected fingers
How it spreads
Transmission of AHF is not well understood and needs further study.
AHF is spread to people by ticks, the Ornithodoros savignyi and Hyalomma dromedari species, that feed on livestock and domestic animals. People can become infected through a tick bite or when crushing infected ticks.
No spread of AHF between people has been documented.
Prevention
Avoid tick bites and livestock in areas where AHF is found.
Use tick repellents on skin and clothes.
Check skin for ticks and remove them promptly.
Use tick collars for pets and tick-killing pesticides for livestock.
Diagnosis
Healthcare professionals can diagnose AHF early with PCR testing or virus isolation. They can also conduct serologic testing using ELISA later in the course of the illness.
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific treatment for AHF.
Supportive care is given to manage symptoms.
1-20% of patients hospitalized for AHF die.
Similar diseases
AHF, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and Rift Valley fever (RVF) have similar signs and symptoms and occur in the same areas.
Alpha-gal Syndrome

About Alpha-gal Syndrome
KEY POINTS
Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a serious, potentially life-threatening allergic condition that can occur after a tick bite.
Alpha-gal is a molecule found in in most mammals.
Symptoms appear after people eat red meat or are exposed to other products containing alpha-gal.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What Is Alpha-gal Syndrome?
Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a serious, potentially life-threatening allergic condition that can occur after a tick bite. It's named for a molecule, galactose-α-1,3-galactose, that's found in most mammals.
Symptoms occur after people eat red meat or are exposed to other products made from mammals. Because of this, AGS is also known as red meat allergy or tick bite meat allergy.
The lone star tick is the species mostly associated with AGS, but other kinds of ticks may be involved.
A CDC report showed that between 2010 and 2022, more than 110,000 suspected cases of AGS were identified. However, cases of AGS are not nationally notifiable to CDC, so the actual number of AGS cases in the United States is not known. More data and research are needed to understand how many people are affected by this condition.
Risk factors
AGS is associated with tick bites. In the United States, AGS is primarily associated with the bite of a lone star tick, but other kinds of ticks have not been ruled out.
Most reported cases of AGS in the United States occur in the South, East, and Central states. These are the areas where most lone star ticks are found. In other countries, other tick species have been linked to AGS.
While people in all age groups can develop AGS, most cases have been reported in adults.
Causes
While AGS is associated with tick bites, more research is needed to understand the role ticks play in starting this condition, and why certain people develop AGS.
Prevention
Preventing tick bites is important and may reduce your chances of developing AGS or other illnesses.
Before you go outdoors:
Avoid grassy, brushy, and wooded areas where ticks may be found.
Walk in the center of trails.
Treat clothing and gear with permethrin, or buy pre-treated items.
Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent
.
After you come indoors:
Check your clothing for ticks.
Examine gear and pets for ticks.
Shower and perform a thorough tick check.
If you see an attached tick, remove it immediately.
Learn how to prevent ticks on your pets and in your yard.
Diagnosis
A healthcare provider may diagnose AGS by:
A physical examination
A detailed patient history
A test for antibodies your body produces in response to alpha-gal
Your healthcare provider may also recommend allergy skin testing.
Living with AGS
AGS should be managed under the care of an allergist or other healthcare provider.
Most healthcare providers recommend patients with AGS stop eating meat from mammals, such as beef, pork, lamb, venison, or rabbit. However, not all patients with AGS have reactions to every ingredient containing alpha-gal.
You will need to work with your healthcare provider to understand which products containing alpha-gal you will need to avoid.
Read food product labels
carefully.
Prevent tick bites. New tick bites may reactivate allergic reactions to alpha-gal.
Talk to your healthcare provider before taking a new medication or receiving a vaccine. Although very rare, some people with severe AGS may react to ingredients in certain vaccines or medications.

About Echinococcosis
KEY POINTS
Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with tiny tapeworms.
Echinococcosis is classified as either cystic echinococcosis or alveolar echinococcosis.
Each species causes different symptoms and spreads in different ways.
Species
Cystic echinocccosis
Cystic echinocccosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a ~ – 7 millimeter long tapeworm found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic, CE causes harmful, slowly enlarging cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs that often grow unnoticed and neglected for years.
Alveolar echinococcosis
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, a ~1 – 4 millimeter long tapeworm found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs (definitive hosts). Small rodents are intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis. Although cases of AE in animals in endemic areas are relatively common, human cases are rare. AE poses a much greater health threat to people than CE, causing parasitic tumors that can form in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, AE can be fatal.

Amebiasis
EXPLORE TOPICS

MAY 2, 2024
About Amebiasis
KEY POINTS
Amebiasis is a disease caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
Amebiasis is more common in people living in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions or people traveling to these areas.
Antibiotics are effective in treating amebiasis.
Overview
Entamoeba histolytica amebas in a person's small intestine.
Amebiasis is caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, or E. histolytica. Anyone can get amebiasis. It is more common if you live in a tropical area with poor sanitary conditions or travel to one of these areas.
If you think you have amebiasis, see your healthcare provider. The disease can be difficult to diagnose. Most people with amebiasis don't get very sick. Everyone with amebiasis should receive medications to treat the infection.
Signs and symptoms
Only about 10% to 20% of people infected with E. histolytica become ill. Even then, symptoms are often mild. They can include diarrhea, stomach pain, and stomach cramping. Symptoms usually develop within 2 to 4 weeks but can show up later.
A severe form of amebiasis called amebic dysentery can cause stomach pain, bloody poop, and fever.
Rarely, E. histolytica travels through the blood stream to the liver and forms an abscess (collection of pus). In a small number of instances, the parasite has spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs and brain.
Risk factors
In the United States, amebiasis is most common in:
People who traveled to tropical places with poor sanitary conditions
Immigrants from tropical countries with poor sanitary conditions
People who live in facilities with poor sanitary conditions
People who have anal sex
Causes
You can get amebiasis if you:
Swallow something such as water or food contaminated with E. histolytica
Put something in your mouth that has touched the poop of someone infected with E. histolytica
Swallow E. histolytica  germs picked up from a contaminated surface or your fingers
Prevention
Washing your hands thoroughly can help prevent spreading amebiasis.
You can spread amebiasis to others. The risk is low if you get treated with antibiotics and practice good hygiene. This includes thoroughly washing your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom or changing diapers. You should also wash your hands before handling or preparing food or drinks.
If in an area with poor sanitary conditions:
Don't eat or drink:
Fountain drinks or any drinks with ice cubes
Fresh fruit or vegetables you didn't peel yourself
Milk, cheese, and dairy products that may not have been pasteurized
Food or drinks sold by street vendors
It is safe to drink:
Bottled water with an unbroken seal
Carbonated (bubbly) water from sealed cans or bottles
Carbonated drinks like soda from sealed cans or bottles
Tap water that has been boiled for at least 1 minute
You also can make tap water safe to drink by first filtering it through an ""absolute 1 micron or less"" filter. Then dissolve chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or iodine tablets in the filtered water.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider will ask for a sample of your poop. You may be asked for several samples from different days. This is because E. histolytica is not always found in every sample.
Diagnosing amebiasis can be very difficult. Other parasites and cells can look very similar to E. histolytica under a microscope.
If you've been told that you have an E. histolytica infection but you're feeling fine, you might be infected with a different parasite, Entamoeba dispar, or E. dispar. It is about 10 times more common worldwide. E. dispar doesn't make people sick and doesn't need to be treated.
Some laboratories, including CDC, have tests that can tell if a person is infected with E. histolytica or E. dispar. Fluid from liver abscesses can also be tested for E. histolytica.
Treatment and recovery
A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat amebiasis. You will take one antibiotic if you're not feeling sick. If you are sick, you'll probably be prescribed a second antibiotic to take after you've finished the first.
Meningitis
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
JANUARY 9, 2024
About Amebic Meningitis
KEY POINTS
Amebic meningitis is rare.
The ameba lives in warm fresh water and soil around the world.
Diagnosing amebic meningitis can be hard.
Healthcare providers can treat these infections with multiple medicines, but they are usually deadly.
What it is
Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare brain infection caused by Naegleria fowleri.
N. fowleri is a free-living ameba. An ameba is a single-celled living organism that is too small to be seen without a microscope.
Symptoms
In its early stages, symptoms of PAM are typical meningitis symptoms. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly.
When to seek medical care
Anyone with symptoms of meningitis should see a healthcare provider right away. This is especially true if you have been swimming in warm fresh water recently. A healthcare provider can determine if you have meningitis, what's causing it, and the best treatment.
Complications
Death usually occurs within 5 days (range 1 to 18 days) of the start of symptoms.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Naegleria fowleri Infection
Exposure risks
Sources of infection
N. fowleri lives in warm fresh water and soil around the world.
Risk factors
Fresh water exposure
Most Naegleria infections occur after people swim or submerge their heads underwater. However, PAM may also occur when people use contaminated tap water to
Cleanse their noses during religious practices
Irrigate their sinuses (send water up the nose)
Geographic location
In the United States, most infections have been linked to swimming in southern states. However, evidence suggests the range of N. fowleri is expanding northward as the climate warms.
Keep Reading:
Causes and Risk
How it spreads
N. fowleri infects people by entering the body through the nose, usually while swimming. The ameba travels up the nose to the brain where it destroys the brain tissue and causes swelling of the brain.
How it doesn't spread
People cannot get infected with N. fowleri from drinking water contaminated with the ameba.
People also do not spread the ameba or PAM to others.
Reducing risk
Personal actions to reduce the risk of N. fowleri infection should focus on limiting the amount of water going up the nose.
Keep Reading:
Prevention
Testing and diagnosis
PAM is difficult to diagnose because of the rarity of the infection and the non-specific early symptoms.
Keep Reading:
Diagnosis
Treatment and recovery
Several drugs are effective against N. fowleri in the laboratory. However, their effectiveness is unclear since almost all infections have been deadly, even when people were treated.

Ammonia
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Do not mix household cleaners!
Ammonia is a toxic clear gas or liquid.
Signs and symptoms of ammonia exposure depend on how you were exposed.
If exposed, get away from the area, get clean, and get help.
Background
Ammonia occurs naturally and is produced by human activity. Ammonia is made up of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is an important source of nitrogen, which is needed by plants and animals. It is widely used in fertilizers and pharmaceuticals.
At room temperature, ammonia is a clear, colorless gas. Ammonia can also be a clear, colorless liquid that dissolves in water. Changing ammonia to a liquid can help with its storage and transportation.
Ammonia can be recognized by its strong smell, which is like the smell of rotting fish. Ammonia reacts with strong oxidizers, acids, halogens (including chlorine bleach), and salts of silver, zinc, copper, and other heavy metals. Ammonia is also commonly used in a liquid form mixed with water, such as household ammonia.
Signs and symptoms
Normal amounts of ammonia in the environment do not cause health effects in humans. Exposure to high levels of ammonia may hurt your skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung damage and death may occur after exposure to very high levels of ammonia.
Most people will smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to ammonia. Exposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical.
Effects depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were exposed for. Some people with asthma or other chronic lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing ammonia than others.
Symptoms of exposure to higher levels of ammonia include the following:
Abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting
Coughing or coughing up white or pink colored fluid
Skin blisters, pain, or redness
Burning feeling in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes
Narrowing of the throat and swelling
Permanent or temporary blindness
Frostbite (if exposed to liquified ammonia)
Exposure to very high levels of ammonia can lead to death.
Exposure
Warning!
Household ammonia can release gas if it is mixed with certain other cleaning products. Do not mix household cleaners!
If ammonia is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the gas. Ammonia gas is lighter than air, so it will rise. If ammonia is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains ammonia.
Ammonia in food
Ammonia is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and taste. Avoid using or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched liquid ammonia if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an ammonia release. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the ammonia was released and breathe fresh air.
If the ammonia release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the ammonia does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the ammonia was released.
If the ammonia release was indoors, get out of the building. If the ammonia release was from household cleaners or chemicals, open windows and doors to let in fresh air. Leave the area until the gas has gone away.
If you cannot get away, go to the lowest ground possible because ammonia is lighter than air and will rise.
Who to contact in an emergency
Call the Poison Control Center for further help at 1-800-222-1222.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take your clothes off
If clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes.
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the ammonia from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. Drop clothes to the floor.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
Wash your body
First wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with a lot of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for several minutes. Finish with a plain water rinse. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch ammonia. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.
Get help
Call 911, go to the hospital (if local officials say it is safe to leave), or call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.

Check the radio, television, mobile news app, or text message alerts for more information.
Treatment
No known cure exists for ammonia exposure. Treatment involves removing ammonia from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel.
If someone has swallowed ammonia, do not force vomiting.
Long-term health effects
While most people recover, survivors who breathed in large amounts may suffer long-term lung damage.
If ammonia touches your eyes, it may cause ulcerations (sores) and perforations (holes) to form in the eye. This can occur up to weeks or months after exposure and could lead to blindness. Cataracts (cloudiness in the eyes) and glaucoma (disease that damages the eye) have also been reported after ammonia exposure.
Repeated exposure to ammonia, usually in the workplace, may cause long-term irritation of the respiratory tract. The respiratory tract includes the mouth, nose, throat, and lungs. Repeated exposures to ammonia have also caused the following:
Chronic coughs
Asthma
Lung fibrosis (scarring and thickening of the lungs)
Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) (asthma caused by chemicals)
Eye and skin irritation

Reptiles and Amphibians
WHAT TO KNOW
Reptiles and amphibians are more likely than other pets to carry harmful germs that can make people sick.
Children under 5, adults over 65, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick from these germs.
Wash your hands after handling reptiles and amphibians, their food, or items in their environment.
Provide your pet reptile or amphibian with routine veterinary care to keep it healthy and prevent the spread of disease.
Overview
Millions of households in the United States own at least one reptile (like a turtle, lizard, or snake) or amphibian (like a frog, salamander, or caecilian). Reptiles have dry and scaly skin, whereas amphibians have smooth, slimy skin.
Reptiles and amphibians are more likely than other pets to carry germs that make people sick, even when they appear clean and healthy.
The most common germ carried by reptiles and amphibians is Salmonella. Reptiles and amphibians often carry Salmonella bacteria in their digestive tracts. Even healthy reptiles and amphibians can carry the bacteria. People can get sick from Salmonella bacteria through contact with reptiles, amphibians, or their environments, including water from their tanks or aquariums.
If you decide that a reptile or amphibian is the right pet for you, it's important to learn how to properly care for your pet. Appropriate husbandry and veterinary care can help keep you both safe from illness.
Diseases
Below is a list of diseases that reptiles and amphibians can spread.
Aeromonas infection
Mycobacterium marinum infection
Salmonella infection
How to stay healthy around reptiles and amphibians
Consider another pet if there are young children, older adults, or people with weakened immune systems in the household.
Before buying or adopting a pet reptile or amphibian, make sure it is the right type of pet for your family. Some reptiles can live for a very long time. Reptiles and amphibians require special care and are more likely than other pets to carry germs that make people sick, like Salmonella, even when they appear clean and healthy.
Not recommended for certain people
Because they are more likely to carry certain germs, reptiles and amphibians aren't recommended for households with young children, people with weakened immune systems, or adults 65 and older.
Wash your hands
Wash your hands with soap and running water:
After feeding your pet or handling pet food
After handling your pet's poop or equipment (for example, cages, aquariums, rocks, enrichment, tank decorations, tank water)
After cleaning your pet's tank or aquarium
Before eating and drinking
Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol.
Safely care for your pet reptile or amphibian
Children's safety
Children younger than 5 years old should not handle or touch reptiles or amphibians or their environments because they are at a higher risk for serious illness and hospitalization caused by Salmonella infection.
Don't cross-contaminate
You don't have to touch a reptile or amphibian to get sick from the germs they carry. Reptile food, tank water, equipment, and habitats can be contaminated with Salmonella and other germs.
Keep reptiles, amphibians, and their equipment out of the kitchen or anywhere that food is prepared, stored, served, or eaten. Don't allow reptiles or amphibians to roam freely throughout a home or living area. Supervise your pet when outside of its habitat to prevent accidents and contamination.
Safely feed your pet reptile or amphibian
Feeder rodents for snakes and other reptiles can carry germs like Salmonella.
Keep pet food separate
Use a designated container for storing and thawing frozen food for your pet. Keep the pet food away from human food.
Wash your hands and clean the container immediately after feeding pet reptiles and amphibians.
Using feeder rodents
Frozen or live rodents used for pet food, also called feeder rodents, can carry germs that can make people sick. This can happen even if the rodent looks healthy and clean.
Certain people shouldn't handle feeder rodents
Children under 5 years old, adults 65 and older, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems shouldn't handle feeder rodents because they are at higher risk for diseases rodents can carry.
Freezing feeder rodents does not kill germs. Always wash your hands after handling live or frozen rodents or touching anything they came in contact with.
Clean and disinfect all surfaces and supplies that come in contact with rodents. Rodents can contaminate surfaces where they are thawed or anything they touch. You can get sick by touching contaminated surfaces; you don't have to touch the rodents to get sick from their germs.
Keep rodents and their supplies out of the kitchen or other areas where food is prepared, served, or consumed. Never use the kitchen sink or food preparation areas to thaw frozen rodents or to clean live rodent habitats. Do not thaw frozen rodents in the microwave.
Clean rodent supplies outside your home when possible. If you clean rodent supplies indoors, use a laundry sink or bathtub, and thoroughly clean and disinfect the area right after. Use frozen rodents when possible to reduce the risk of injury to your or your pet. Never feed your pets wild rodents.
Safely clean your pet reptile or amphibian's habitat
Animal supplies such as tanks, feeders, water containers, and other pet equipment or materials should be cleaned outside the home if possible. Never use food preparation areas to clean reptile and amphibian habitats or equipment.
If you clean supplies outside, do so away from gardens or other sources of food or drinking water.
If cleaning outside the home isn't possible, clean supplies in a laundry sink or bathtub. If you clean supplies in the bathtub, thoroughly clean and disinfect the area before use by others. Pour tank water and other wastewater from reptile and amphibian habitats down the toilet instead of sinks or drains.

Prevent reptile scratches and bites
Not all reptiles and amphibians have teeth, but even those who don't (like most turtles) can still have painful bites. Bites from reptiles and amphibians can be dangerous because they can spread germs and sometimes other toxic substances, depending on the type of animal. Bites and scratches can be serious injuries and sometimes can become infected.
How to prevent bites and scratches
Don't kiss or hold reptiles or amphibians close to your face, as this might frighten them and increase your chances of being bitten.
Make sure the animal sees you before you pick it up. If an animal is surprised, they might bite out of fear.
Feed your reptile with tongs. Don't give them food from your hand. Handle your pet often so they become used to being held. If you only handle your pet to feed them, they might learn to associate a hand with food.
What to do if you are bitten or scratched
Wash bites and scratches immediately
Pet bites and scratches can spread germs, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious. If you are bitten or scratched by a reptile or amphibian, you should wash the wounds with warm soapy water immediately.
Seek medical attention, especially if:
The animal appears sick or is acting unusual.
The wound or injury is serious (uncontrolled bleeding, unable to move, extreme pain, muscle or bone is showing, or the bite is over a joint).
The wound or site of injury becomes red, painful, warm, or swollen. (Especially if the person bitten is younger than 5 years old, 65 or older, a pregnant woman, or has a weakened immune system.)
It has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot.
If the animal becomes sick or dies after biting a person, let your veterinarian know within a few days to a week. They can determine whether the animal might have had germs that could spread to people.
Venomous reptiles and amphibians
Do not keep venomous animals as pets.
CDC does not recommend keeping venomous animals as pets or in household settings.
Venoms are a defense that some reptiles and amphibians use to protect themselves from any potential dangers or harm in their environment. Some venomous animals, like poison dart frogs and coral snakes, can be identified by their bright colors and markings. However, some venomous animals are harder to identify. Some animals can transmit venoms through bites or through contact with their skin or saliva.
You should always consider the unpredictable nature of venomous animals and be aware that treating a bite from a venomous animal is difficult. Venoms are very toxic and can have severe and life-threatening effects. Antivenoms can treat some bites, but these medications can cost hundreds of dollars and might not be available at some hospitals. In addition, antivenom sometimes can cause allergic reactions that can be just as dangerous as the venom itself.
If you keep or work with venomous animals, make a list of all the hospitals in your area that stock antivenoms for those types of animals. Include hospital phone numbers and addresses. Put this list somewhere easy to find, like on your refrigerator or near the animal's habitat.
What to do if you are bitten by a venomous animal or get venom on your skin
Seek medical attention for venomous bites
Seek medical attention immediately for a bite from a venemous animal, even if the wound doesn't seem serious.
Call your healthcare provider as soon as possible so that they can prepare the appropriate antivenom. Be as clear as possible about the type, colors, and markings of the animal. Correct identification of the animal helps healthcare providers to provide the appropriate treatment.
Don't handle or trap the animal, because venom can be dangerous even after the animal has died. Remain as calm and still as possible until you can be treated by a healthcare provider.
Apply first aid:
Lay or sit down. If possible, position the bite so that it is below the heart.
Remove rings and jewelry before swelling begins.
Wash the wound with warm water and soap.
Cover the wound with a clean, dry bandage.
Go to the hospital as soon as possible. Fast treatment will reduce damage caused by venom and improve chances for recovery.
Don't drive. Snake bites can cause dizziness and fainting.
How to keep pet reptiles and amphibians healthy
Keeping pet reptiles and amphibians healthy can help keep you healthy too.
Before choosing a pet reptile or amphibian
Think about the people in your household. Some people are at higher risk for serious illness from germs reptiles and amphibians can carry, especially children younger than 5 years old, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems.
Do your research
Research and learn how to properly care for reptiles and amphibians before buying or adopting. Ask a veterinarian about the proper food, care, environment, and other needs of the specific pet you are interested in adopting.
Find an exotic veterinarian in your area
Reptiles and amphibians require specialized care. Most veterinarians do not treat reptiles or amphibians.
Check local laws
Check state, local, and property laws before selecting or purchasing a reptile or amphibian. Some reptiles or amphibians might not be allowed in apartments or rental homes. Do not keep venomous animals as pets or in household settings.
Did You Know?
The sale of turtles less than 4 inches has been banned in the United States since 1975. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration made this decision because small turtles pose a higher risk of spreading disease, especially to children. Each year, the ban prevents an estimated 100,000 cases of Salmonella infection among children.
How to choose a pet reptile or amphibian
Remember that some reptiles and amphibians can live for a very long time. Make sure you are prepared for the commitment of caring for the animal during its long lifespan.
Choose healthy animals
Ask about the animal's diet and if it has been eating (if an animal isn't eating, there may be a health problem).
Don't keep wild animals as pets
Don't catch wild reptiles or amphibians and keep them as pets.
Buy turtles with shells longer than 4 inches
Federal law bans the sale of small turtles
, although some are illegally sold in souvenir shops and at roadside stands. Buy only from a trusted pet store and avoid roadside or temporary vendors.
How to house your reptile or amphibian
Provide your reptile or amphibian with a safe, warm, and comfortable environment that has the appropriate humidity levels and lighting. Reptiles and amphibians often have very specific requirements for their habitats. Talk with your veterinarian about your pet's needs.
Don't allow pet reptiles and amphibians to interact with or eat wild animals.
Monitor your pet's health
Exotic veterinarians can help keep pet reptiles and amphinians healthy.
Learn about proper management of your reptile or amphibian's health, including temperature and humidity requirements. Taking good care of the animal can decrease your pet's stress and the chances of it getting sick.
To keep your pet as healthy as possible, visit an exotic veterinarian experienced in reptile and amphibian care (herpetology) for regular check-ups. A veterinarian will not be able to prevent your reptile or amphibian from shedding Salmonella because these bacteria are normally found in healthy reptiles and amphibians.
If your pet becomes sick or dies soon after purchase, take it to the veterinarian and inform the pet store or breeder about the pet's illness or death. Consider waiting before purchasing or adopting another pet. Do not use the habitat until it has been properly cleaned and disinfected. These practices will help prevent the spread of disease.
What to do if you no longer want your pet reptile or amphibian
Don't release unwanted pets
Releasing pets isn't good for the animal or the environment. Most reptiles and amphibians released outdoors will die, and some can threaten natural wildlife
Find a new home for your pet:
Contact a nearby pet store for advice on rehoming your pet.
Contact a local pet rescue group to see if they can help rehome your pet.
Contact a local aquarium or zoo to see if they would accept your pet.

About Anaplasmosis
KEY POINTS
Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum primarily spread to people by the bite of an infected tick.
Signs and symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within 1–2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick.
Healthcare providers order certain blood tests to look for evidence of anaplasmosis.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
What it is
Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacteria A. phagocytophilum. These bacteria are spread to people by tick bites primarily from:
The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis)
The western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus)
People with anaplasmosis will often have fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches. Doxycycline is the drug of choice for adults and children of all ages with anaplasmosis.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within 1–2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick, however many people do not remember being bitten.
See your healthcare provider if you become ill after being bitten by a tick or have been in areas where ticks live. Ticks commonly live in the woods or in areas with high brush.
Early illness
Early signs and symptoms (days 1-5) are usually mild or moderate and may include:
Fever, chills
Severe headache
Muscle aches
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite
Late illness
If treatment is delayed or if there are other medical conditions present, anaplasmosis can cause severe illness. Prompt treatment can reduce your risk of developing severe illness.
Signs and symptoms of severe (late stage) illness can include:
Respiratory failure
Bleeding problems
Organ failure
Death
Risk factors for severe illness:
Delayed treatment
65 years of age or older
Weakened immune system
People with weakened immune systems are at risk for severe illness. This includes people receiving some cancer treatments, individuals with advanced HIV infection, prior organ transplants, or people taking some medications.
How it spreads
Transmission
Anaplasmosis is a tickborne disease caused by the bacteria A. phagocytophilum.
Tick bites
A. phagocytophilum is primarily spread to people by the bite of an infected tick. In the United States, the bacteria are carried by the:
Blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the eastern United States.
Map of the United States showing approximate distribution of the Blacklegged tick
Western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) along the West Coast

About Soil-transmitted helminths
KEY POINTS
Soil-transmitted Helminths, or STH, are parasitic worms that live in the human intestine.
They spread through soil or water contaminated by human feces (poop) that contain the parasite larvae.
STH infections are considered neglected tropical diseases or NTDs.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities.
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer.
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are:
Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.
Contaminating drinking water sources.
Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.
Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil.
Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.
Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.
Hookworm
You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.
Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.
One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Blood and protein or nutrient loss
Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)
Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections
Wash your hands before handling food.
Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.
Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.
Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or ""preventive chemotherapy"".
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other ""neglected tropical diseases"" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA).

About Rat Lungworm Disease
KEY POINTS
Angiostrongylus is a parasite found in rats. It is also called rat lungworm.
People can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite.
Most people infected with rat lungworm recover on their own without treatment.
MORE INFORMATION

Public Health
Overview
Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a parasitic worm of rats. It is also called the rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite is found only in rodents. Infected rats pass larvae of the parasite in their feces. Snails and slugs get infected by ingesting the larvae. These larvae mature in snails and slugs but do not become adult worms. The life cycle is completed when rats eat infected snails or slugs and the larvae further mature to become adult worms.
Species
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which is also known as the rat lungworm, causes eosinophilic meningitis and is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands. The recognized distribution of the parasite has been increasing over time and infections have been identified in other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States.
Angiostrongylus costaricensis causes eosinophilic gastroenteritis and is found in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Symptoms
Some infected people don’t have any symptoms—or have only mild symptoms that don’t last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of meningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting.
How it spreads
People can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. In some cultures, snails are commonly eaten. Some children, in particular, have gotten infected by swallowing snails/slugs ""on a dare. "" People also can get infected by accident, by eating raw produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one.
Certain animals such freshwater shrimp, crabs, or frogs, have been found to be infected with larvae of the parasite. African land snails, which can grow larger than a person’s hand, is just one of many types that can be infected. But snails can be infected only if they have ingested contaminated rat feces.
It is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are infected could result in people becoming infected, though the evidence for this is not as clear as for eating infected snails and slugs. Of note, fish do not spread this parasite.
Resource
This video illustrates how people get infected with A. cantonensis or rat lungworm.


Prevention
Don’t eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear gloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When travelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables.
Testing and diagnosis
See your healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask about any symptoms, travel, and exposures you’ve had (for example, to snails/slugs). You might have some blood tests, as well as tests for meningitis.
Treatment
The parasite dies over time, even without treatment. Even people who develop eosinophilic meningitis usually don’t need antiparasitics. Sometimes the symptoms of the infection last for several weeks or months, while the body’s immune system responds to the dying parasites. The most common types of treatment are for the symptoms of the infection, such as pain medication for headache or medications to reduce the body’s reaction to the parasite, rather than for the infection itself. Patients with severe cases of meningitis may benefit from some other types of treatment.

PARASITES 
JANUARY 31, 2024
About Anisakiasis
KEY POINTS
Anisakiasis is a disease caused by a parasite.
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
Anyone who eats undercooked or raw fish or squid is at risk.
You can prevent getting anisakiasis by not eating raw or undercooked fish or squid.
Overview
Anisakiasis (also known as herring worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused by nematodes (worms) that attach to the walls of the esophagus, stomach, or intestine.
Anisakiasis is most commonly found in areas where eating raw fish is popular, such as Japan. Because eating undercooked fish is becoming more common, there have been cases in the US, Europe, South America, and other areas of the world.
Signs and symptoms
People with anisakiasis can experience signs and symptoms such as
Abdominal pain
Nausea
Vomiting
Abdominal distention (abnormal abdominal expansion)
Diarrhea
Blood and mucus in stool
Mild fever
People can also experience allergic reactions such as
Rashes
Itching
Infrequently anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
Some people experience a tingling sensation during or after eating raw or undercooked fish or squid. This sensation is actually the worm moving in the mouth or throat. People can often take the worm out of their mouth themselves or cough it up to prevent infection. Some people experience vomiting, which can often expel the worm from the body.
How it spreads
When certain infected marine mammals (e.g., whales or sea lions) defecate (poop) in the sea, they release eggs. These eggs become infective larvae while in the water. Crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters, shrimps) consume the infective larvae, and then fish or squid consume the crustaceans.
When humans eat raw or undercooked infected fish or squid, they consume the nematode larvae, which can invade the gastrointestinal tract. Eventually, the parasite dies and produces an inflamed mass in the esophagus, stomach, or intestine.
People cannot spread anisakiasis to one another.
Prevention
To prevent anisakiasis, do not eat raw or undercooked fish or squid.
Food precautions
The FDA recommends the following for seafood preparation or storage to kill parasites:
Cooking (Seafood in General)
Cook seafood adequately (to an internal temperature of at least 145° F [~63° C]).
Freezing (Fish)
At -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid, and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours.
Learn more about safe food handling practices: The Core Four Practices of Food Safety | FightBAC.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can diagnose anisakiasis by endoscopy, radiography, or surgery if the worm is embedded. It is helpful for your healthcare provider to know if you ate undercooked fish or squid.
Treatment and recovery
Your healthcare provider may remove the worm from your body through endoscopy or surgery.
This information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for consultation with a health care provider. If you have any questions about the parasites described above or think that you may have a parasitic infection, consult a health care provider.

About Anthrax
KEY POINTS
Anthrax can cause severe illness in both people and animals.
The bacteria that causes anthrax occurs naturally in soil worldwide.
People usually get anthrax from infected animals or contaminated animal products.
Call a healthcare provider immediately if you think you have been exposed to anthrax.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Anthrax is a serious disease usually caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. It's found naturally in soil around the world and commonly affects livestock and wild animals. People usually get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. People can breathe in anthrax spores, eat food or drink water contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the skin.
Livestock and wild animals can become infected when they breathe in, eat, or drink spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. These animals can include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer.
Anthrax is rare in the United States. However, occasional outbreaks do happen in wild and domestic grazing animals such as cattle or deer. In the United States, veterinarians recommend yearly vaccination of livestock in areas where animals have had anthrax in the past.
Most people will never be exposed to anthrax. However, there are jobs, hobbies, and activities that can put some people at higher risk of exposure.
Anthrax risk and prevention
Learn more about who's at risk of exposure and how to prevent anthrax.
Prevention
Types
The type of illness a person develops depends on how anthrax enters the body: through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal system. All types of anthrax can cause death if they're not treated with antibiotics.
There are four types of anthrax:
Cutaneous anthrax happens when anthrax spores get into a cut or scape on the skin when a person handles infected animals or contaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair. It mostly shows up on the head, neck, forearms, and hands. It's the most common form of anthrax infection, and it's also considered to be the least dangerous.
Recently, injection anthrax was identified in heroin-injecting drug users in northern Europe, but it hasn't been reported in the United States. Injection anthrax is similar to cutaneous anthrax and causes infection deep under the skin or in the muscle where the drug was injected.

Inhalation anthrax happens when a person breathes in anthrax spores. It's the deadliest form of the disease. People who work in places such as wool mills, slaughterhouses, and tanneries may breathe in the spores when working with infected animals or contaminated animal products. Inhalation anthrax starts primarily in the lymph nodes in the chest before spreading throughout the rest of the body.

Inhalation anthrax happens when people breathe in spores.
Gastrointestinal anthrax happens when a person eats raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal. It has rarely been reported in the United States. It affects the upper gastrointestinal tract (throat and esophagus), stomach, and intestines, causing a wide variety of symptoms.
View LargerDownload
Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs when a person consumes raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal.
New disease caused by anthrax toxin
Welder's anthrax is a newly identified and rare disease that has been found in several people who are welders or metalworkers. This disease causes severe pneumonia and can be fatal. If you are a welder or metalworker and you develop fever and chills with sudden cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood, see a healthcare provider immediately.
Symptoms
The symptoms of anthrax depend on the type of infection. Symptoms show up anywhere from 1 day to more than 2 months after you're exposed to the bacteria that cause anthrax. If you don't get proper treatment, all types of anthrax have the potential to spread through your body and cause severe illness and death.
Cutaneous anthrax

Symptoms include:
Group of itchy, small blisters or bumps
Large amount of swelling around the sore
Painless sore commonly on the face, neck, arms, or hand that has a black center
Sore appears after the bumps have gone down
For injection anthrax, infected sores (abscesses) deep under the skin or muscle at the injection site
Inhalation anthrax

Headache or body aches
Extreme tiredness
Gastrointestinal anthrax
Symptoms include:
Fever and chills
Swelling of neck or neck glands
Sore throat, hoarseness, and pain when swallowing
Nausea and vomiting, especially bloody vomiting
Diarrhea or bloody diarrhea
Headache
Red face and red eyes
Stomach pain and swelling

If you've been exposed to anthrax
See a healthcare provider immediately and explain how you may have been exposed. It's important to get medical care as quickly as possible to have the best chances for a full recovery. Doctors can prescribe antibiotics to prevent you from getting sick, or as treatment if you're already sick.

There is no test to find out if you have been exposed to anthrax. Public health departments will have to do an investigation to see if and how you were exposed.

About Anthrax Prevention
KEY POINTS
Anthrax can cause serious disease, but treatment immediately following an exposure helps prevent illness.
The U.S. government has a plan to rapidly distribute antibiotics to prevent anthrax in the event of a bioterrorism attack.
Know what to do to protect yourself and your family if there is an anthrax event.
Overview
Anthrax is rare, and most people will never be exposed to it. Anthrax is not contagious, which means you can’t catch it from another person like the cold or flu. However, people can be exposed to anthrax during a bioterrorism attack. Anthrax can be deadly if not treated quickly after exposure. It is important to know how to protect yourself and others around you if you are exposed to anthrax, including during a bioterrorism event.
Preventing anthrax
Vaccine
Sometimes anthrax vaccine is recommended for people who may have been exposed to anthrax. The vaccine does not have anthrax bacteria in it, and it cannot give you anthrax. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved emergency use of the vaccine after a possible anthrax exposure. There are two types of anthrax vaccines approved by the FDA for people ages 18 to 65 after possible anthrax exposure:
Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA), which consists of 3 shots of anthrax vaccine over 4 weeks
AVA adjuvanted, which consists of 2 shots given 2 weeks apart
In both cases, people exposed to anthrax will also get antibiotics for up to 60 days.
In an emergency, the only people who shouldn't get the vaccine are people with a past serious allergic reaction to the anthrax vaccine, or anyone who has an allergy to one of the ingredients in the vaccine. Your healthcare professional can tell you about the vaccine's ingredients. These individuals should take antibiotics for 60 days.
Antibiotics
Anthrax is caused by bacteria called Bacillus anthracis, which can be effectively treated with antibiotics.
If there is an anthrax emergency, you will likely be given an antibiotic because you may have breathed in anthrax bacteria. You may receive doxycycline (DOX-i-SYE-kleen) or ciprofloxacin (sip-roe-FLOX-a-sin). These medicines reduce your chance of getting sick and dying.
Public health officials will provide information on who should get the medicine. It's important to take one of these medicines as soon as possible after the emergency starts. If you have questions, talk to a healthcare provider.
People who may have breathed in anthrax bacteria should take one of the medicines twice a day for up to 60 days. Most people will be given a 10-day supply to start. Public health officials will tell you whether you need more and how to get it. To reduce your chance of getting sick, take the medicine as long as you are directed and don't stop it early.
Instructions for taking doxycycline
Pills
For children weighing 76 pounds (35 kg) or more and adults aged 18 years or older, take one 100 mg pill in the morning and one 100 mg pill in the evening with a full glass of water.
The morning and evening doses should be taken 12 hours apart each day for as long as directed.
Doxycycline works just as well whether you take it with or without food, but it may upset your stomach if you don't take it with food.
Liquids and Slurries
For children weighing less than 76 pounds (35 kg), the dose of doxycycline is based on weight. Follow instructions on the liquid doxycycline label, if provided.
If you do not have access to liquid doxycycline for children, you can create an antibiotic slurry. To make the slurry, you crush antibiotics and mix it into liquid or foods like applesauce or pudding. It can also be helpful if an adult has difficulty swallowing pills. Get detailed instructions to create an antibiotic slurry.
More about doxycycline
For more information about doxycycline, including side effects, what an allergic reaction looks like, and more, visit Emergency Use of Doxycycline.
Instructions for taking ciprofloxacin
Adults and children 67 pounds (31kg) or more
Take 1 pill (500 mg) in the morning with a full glass of water.
Twelve (12) hours later, take 1 pill (500 mg) in the evening with a full glass of water.
You can take ciprofloxacin with or without food.
Children under 67 pounds (31kg)
Follow instructions provided on the liquid ciprofloxacin label.
Shake the liquid very well for about 15 seconds before each use.
Take the same amount in the morning and evening (12 hours apart) each day for as long as healthcare providers or officials recommend you should take it.

Anthropometry and Work: An Overview
KEY POINTS
Anthropometric measurements can help determine degree of protection against dangerous exposures.
Illness or injury may occur if workers’ normal anthropometric measurements are not considered in workplace designs and personal protective equipment.
Definitions
Anthropometry - the science that defines physical measures of a person's size, form, and functional capacities
Functional capacity - the ability to complete certain work tasks based on human size or form
How it works
Anthropometric measurements are used to study the interaction of workers with tasks, tools, machines, vehicles, and personal protective equipment (PPE). These measurements are often used to determine the degree of protection against dangerous exposures, long term or short term.
Many workers experience the benefit of applying anthropometric measurements. For example:
Construction workers benefit from more than one size of fall harness.
Truck drivers have a more ergonomic design of truck cabs.
Firefighters have improved PPE for best fit.
Police officers have improved uniform fit for more body types.
Consider this
Diverse workforces in many occupations require body-size data for designing adequate workplaces, systems, and PPE.
Impacts
Technological development in recent years has advanced the basic science of human size and shape studies in 3-dimensional (3D) forms. Computer-generated human models are now available for anthropometric analysis. These advances have made it possible to improve workplace and protective equipment design, and anthropometric fit within complex systems.
Did you know?
In applied anthropometry, collection and use of 3D anthropometric data have become a norm. This will ultimately result in a better fit between workers and their tools, systems, and work environments.
Safety risks
Designs that are incompatible with normal anthropometric measurements of a workforce may result in unwanted incidents. For example:
The misfit of a heavy equipment cabin to a worker may create operator blind spots that expose workers on foot to struck-by injuries.
Inadequate length or configuration of seatbelts may lead to non-use of seat belts, which affect post-crash survivability.
When PPE does not fit correctly it cannot sufficiently protect workers from health and safety exposures or hazards.
What the data shows
Existing data on the size and shape of industrial workers is limited. There is a lack of anthropometric data for the general worker population. Safety researchers have generally relied on data drawn from studies of military personnel. Most of these studies took place during the 1950s to 1970s.
However, substantial anthropometric variability exists among the general worker population. They are quite different from the average military population. Industrial workers like agricultural, truck driver, and firefighter workforces, are also anthropometrically different from the average civilian population.1

WHAT TO KNOW
CDC's educational effort, Be Antibiotics Aware, aims to improve antibiotic prescribing and use among target consumer and healthcare professional audiences to protect patient safety and combat antimicrobial resistance.
U.S. Antibiotic Awareness Week (USAAW) is an annual observance that raises awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and the importance of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal use.
Be Antibiotics Aware complements USAAW by providing partners with key messages, sample social media posts, and graphics and videos they can use to spread the word within their organization.
Overview
USAAW 2024: Fighting Antimicrobial Resistance Takes All of Us
USAAW is an annual observance that raises awareness of the threat of AR and its impact on human health. This year, CDC is focusing on how fighting antimicrobial resistance takes all of us by sharing calls to action for diverse audiences.
Antibiotics can save lives and are critical tools for treating common and serious infections, including those that can lead to sepsis.
Any time antibiotics or antifungals are used, they can cause side effects and contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance, one of the most urgent threats to the public's health.
Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs, like bacteria and fungi, develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur in the United States each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. Many more die from complications from antimicrobial-resistant infections.
Improving how healthcare professionals prescribe and how patients take antibiotics can help keep patients healthy from adverse events, combat antimicrobial resistance, and help ensure these life-saving drugs will be available for future generations.
Each year during USAAW, CDC works collaboratively with federal, domestic, and international partners to raise awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and highlight the critical importance of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal use. Check out CDC's U.S. Antibiotic Awareness Week webpage to help spread the word.
The observance is an international collaboration, coinciding with:
European Antibiotic Awareness Day
Australia's Antimicrobial Awareness Week
Canada's Antimicrobial Awareness Week
World AMR Awareness Week

Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Networks
KEY POINTS
In the United States (U.S.) and around the globe, CDC's Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network and Global Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory and Response Network support lab testing for healthcare, community and environmental (e.g., water, soil) settings.
This work ultimately improves patient care, enhances public health and informs solutions against antimicrobial resistance threats.
Overview
CDC's Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network (AR Lab Network), established in 2016, provides domestic, nationwide lab capacity to rapidly detect antimicrobial resistance (AR) and inform local responses to prevent spread and protect people. It closes the gap between local capabilities and the data needed to combat AR in the U.S.
CDC's Global Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory and Response Network (Global AR Lab & Response Network), launched in 2021, improves the detection of existing and emerging AR threats outside of the U.S. It identifies risk factors that drive the emergence and spread of resistance across health care, the community, and the environment. This global network also supports local public health responses to stop AR threats and informs global prevention strategies for antimicrobial resistance.

Antineoplastic Agents Risk Factors
KEY POINTS
While antineoplastic agents (cancer chemotherapy and cytotoxic drugs) can be lifesaving for cancer patients, exposure can harm healthcare workers.
Among other things, antineoplastic drugs can cause long-term organ damage, fertility issues, and even cancer.
Learn about exposure risks and find resources about the dangers of antineoplastic agents.
Overview of risk factors
The adverse health effects associated with antineoplastic agents (cancer chemotherapy and cytotoxic drugs) in patients are well documented. The very nature of antineoplastic agents makes them harmful to healthy cells and tissues as well as the cancerous cells.
Healthcare workers at risk
For cancer patients with a life-threatening disease, there is great benefit to treatment with antineoplastic agents. However, for healthcare workers exposed to antineoplastic agents on the job, precautions are important to eliminate or reduce exposure.
Pharmacists or nurses who prepare and/or administer these drugs have the highest potential for exposure to antineoplastic agents. Other healthcare workers at risk include:
Physicians and operating room personnel.
Shipping/receiving, custodial, laundry, and waste workers.
Veterinary oncology workers.
Health impacts
In addition to acute or short-term effects related to treatment with antineoplastic agents, the following long-term or chronic effects have been documented:
Liver and kidney damage.
Bone marrow damage.
Lung and heart damage.
Infertility (temporary and permanent).
Effects on reproduction and the developing fetus in pregnant women.
Hearing impairment.
Cancer.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) found a number of antineoplastic agents are associated with cancer in patients. IARC currently lists:
Eleven agents and two combined therapies as Group 1 (human carcinogens).
Twelve agents as Group 2A (probable human carcinogens).
Eleven agents as Group 2B (possible human carcinogens).

Hazardous Drug Exposures in Healthcare
Identifying exposures
A number of studies have documented environmental and worker exposure to antineoplastic agents in healthcare settings. In addition, analytical methods, such as measuring the drugs and/or their metabolites in worker urine, help document worker exposure.
Worker exposures
Some of the following biological endpoints are used to evaluate worker exposure:
Urine mutagenicity.
Chromosomal damage.
Sister chromatid exchange.
Micronuclei induction.
DNA damage.
HPRT mutations.
Thioether excretion.
Environmental exposures
Similar analytical methods measure the level of environmental contamination in the workplace. Although limited studies on air sampling exist, there have been numerous studies published on environmental wipe sampling for these drugs.
Preventing exposures
In September 2004, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published an Alert: Preventing Occupational Exposures to Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Health Care Settings, 2004, (DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2004-165). This topic page is an expanded bibliography of related publications drawn from the published literature related to the Alert.
Additional information on this topic can be found on the NIOSH Hazardous Drug Exposures in Healthcare page.
Resources
In addition to the resources below, you can explore the NIOSH Hazardous Drugs Resources page or see the NIOSHTIC-2 database search results on Antineoplastic Agents/Chemotherapy. NIOSHTIC-2 is a database of occupational safety and health publications funded in whole or in part by NIOSH.
Decontamination and deactivation
Several reports have dealt with methods for the decontamination and/or deactivation of antineoplastic agents. Although bleach (hypochlorite) is often recommended for the decontamination purposes, it is not effective with all classes of agents. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that cleaning with bleach solutions will destroy all types of antineoplastic agents.

Evaluation of protective equipment
The most often used type of protective equipment for handling antineoplastic agents is gloves. Typically, latex and other materials have been employed for this use. However, with the concern over latex allergies, newer materials are being marketed and evaluated for use with these agents. Protective gowns are another piece of equipment that is commonly used in the handling of antineoplastic agents.

About Aortic Aneurysm
KEY POINTS
An aortic aneurysm is a dangerous balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso.
What it is
Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:
The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms.
A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. An abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is more common, happens below the chest.
Facts about aortic aneurysm in the United States
Aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections were the cause of 9,904 deaths in 2019.1
In 2019, about 59% of deaths due to aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection happen among men.1
A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms.2
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms.3
Types
Thoracic aortic aneurysm
A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age.4
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:
Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back.
Shortness of breath.
Trouble breathing or swallowing.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people.5
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them.6
Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:
Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs.
Other types
Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms—those found in arteries other than the aorta—can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.
Risk factors
Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm.
Other factors include
High blood pressure
High blood cholesterol
Atherosclerosis (hardened arteries)
Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your risk.
Treatment and recovery
The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are medicines and surgery. Medicines can lower blood pressure and reduce risk for an aortic aneurysm. Surgery can repair or replace the affected section of the aorta.

About Arctic Investigations Program
KEY POINTS
AIP is dedicated to improving the health of people in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.
AIP promotes health equity with a focus on indigenous populations.
Why it matters
View Larger
Together, our work protects families. Photo courtesy of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC).
For more than 50 years, CDC's Arctic Investigations Program (AIP) has collaborated with key public health partners including Alaska Tribal Health Organizations, the State of Alaska Department of Health, and other Arctic health leaders to address infectious diseases and promote healthy equity. AIP uses innovative laboratory diagnostics, epidemiology, outbreak investigations, and prioritized research to fulfill their mission.
Examples of AIP work that have directly improved the health of the people in Alaska:
90% reduction in pneumococcal disease in Alaska Native children after conjugate vaccines were introduced.
No cases of acute hepatitis B infections in western Alaska since 1995 (region previously had the highest rate in the United States).
94% reduction in Haemophilus influenzae type b disease in Alaska Native children after infant vaccines were introduced and a 96% reduction in non-Native children.
Priorities
Vaccine-preventable diseases
Equitable access to vaccines can improve health. Photo courtesy of ANTHC.
AIP works to ensure equitable access to vaccines by collaborating with partners to reach remote and underserved areas. AIP also evaluates the effectiveness of current and new vaccines and continues to monitor and investigate where and why vaccine-preventable diseases are occurring.
Viral hepatitis
AIP scientists continue to work to reduce health disparities by helping to lower rates of hepatitis A, B, and C among Alaskan populations. To accomplish their goals, AIP experts conduct public health research, work in partnership to expand screening in rural populations, and identify barriers that affect access to treatment.
Respiratory viruses
AIP helps protect those in remote communities. Photo courtesy of ANTHC.
AIP works to protect families and communities from respiratory diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These illnesses are particularly challenging to test for and treat in populations in remote areas, in places that are medically underserved, and in communities adversely affected by health disparities. To help overcome these obstacles, AIP monitors disease prevalence in these areas (surveillance), conducts public health research, and continues to investigate more effective prevention and control strategies.
Climate-sensitive and emerging infections
Beavers are one of the animals in Alaska that can transmit giardia.
AIP collaborates with Arctic partners on public health surveillance projects and research initiatives to help address climate-sensitive infectious disease threats. AIP and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium formed a One Health working group to better understand and respond to issues at the interface of human, animal, and environmental health. This group supports the Local Environmental Observer Network and helps the Alaska Tribal Health System understand and respond to changes in the environment. AIP scientists are working to evaluate animal-to-human infectious threats that may be climate sensitive, such as intestinal giardiasis, which can be transmitted from beavers and may be moving northward in Alaska.

About Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers
AT A GLANCE
Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of diseases that are caused by several distinct families of viruses.
The term ""viral hemorrhagic fever"" refers to a condition where many of the body's organ systems are affected, the overall cardiovascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to function on its own is reduced.
In addition to VHFs, there are serious infectious diseases like Nipah and Hendra diseases that also require a specialized laboratory, are highly pathogenic, and have no, or limited, vaccine or treatment currently available.
VHFs, Nipah and Hendra disease can cause relatively mild illness or more life-threatening disease. Symptoms can vary but may include bleeding or hemorrhaging. Distribution of these viruses is determined by where the animals that naturally carry them live.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Types
Most VHFs fall into one of four families of virus:
Arenaviruses
Each arenavirus has one or a few closely related rodents that carry the virus without getting sick themselves. This is known as the reservoir, or source of the virus in nature. The reservoir can spread the virus to people through infected urine, saliva, or droppings, and can cause severe disease in people.
People are infected with arenaviruses by:
Touching with rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials from an infected rodent
Breathing in air contaminated by rodent urine, droppings or nesting materials.
Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent.
Eating food contaminated by urine, droppings, or saliva from an infected rodent.
Contact with another person who has certain arenaviruses, such as Chapare, Lassa, Machupo, and Lujo viruses.
Bunyavirales order
Viruses in the Bunyavirales order are spread by rodents or insects, such as mosquitos, ticks, or sand flies. They can produce mild to severe disease in animals and people. Many of these viruses cannot spread between people. However, person-to-person spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has occurred in healthcare settings where infection control was limited.
Filoviruses
Filoviruses can cause severe illness in people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and gorillas). The Egyptian rousette bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is a cave-dwelling bat, and the reservoir for Marburg virus. Bats infected with orthomarburgviruses do not show obvious signs of illness. It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that bats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they can spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Caretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection.
Flaviviruses
Flaviviruses, are found throughout the world. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to severe disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large economic and social impact on people living in affected areas.
Paramyxoviruses
Paramyxoviruses can cause sudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within the Paramyxoviridae family, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because they require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.

Prevention
Prevention of VHFs and other HCIDs depends on the host reservoir and how the virus spreads. Prevention measures can target reservoir exclusion activities (for example, use of insect repellents, bed nets, and protective clothing and disinfection procedures while caring for a sick person) or by sealing up and setting traps in homes and other buildings when a rodent infestation is discovered.

Arsine
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Arsine is a toxic gas that is colorless, flammable, and non-irritating.
Signs and symptoms of arsine poisoning depend on exposure method and dose.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Arsine is a colorless, flammable, non-irritating toxic gas with a mild garlic odor. Arsine is formed when arsenic comes in contact with an acid.
Arsine is similar to a gas called stibine, which is formed when the metal antimony comes in contact with an acid. Stibine has health effects similar to those of arsine, but it is not as widely available. Stibine also has a noticeable ""rotten egg"" smell.
Where it is found
Arsine is most commonly used in the semiconductor and metals refining industries.
Arsine was studied as a warfare agent during World War II, but it was never used on the battlefield.
How it works
After arsine enters the bloodstream, it damages the red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms of hemolytic anemia, when red blood cells die faster than the body can replace them.
Signs and symptoms
The effects of arsine poisoning depend on how much arsine a person was exposed to and how long the exposure was.
Depending on the level of exposure to arsine, symptoms are likely to occur within the first 24 hours after exposure.
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to arsine.
Exposure to low or moderate dose:
Confusion, drowsiness, fatigue, and/or weakness
Headache
Muscle cramps
Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain
Rapid breathing or shortness of breath
Red or dark urine
Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice)
Exposure to a large dose:
Convulsions
Loss of consciousness
Paralysis
Respiratory compromise, possibly leading to death
Exposure
Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after arsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the skin.
At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it has no smell. At higher amounts, a mild garlic smell (however, do not rely on this as a warning). On the other hand, stibine has a strong smell, so people may notice that they may have been exposed.
Most reports of exposure are when arsine is accidentally made in the workplace. Arsine gas is heavier than air, so it would be more likely to settle in lower areas.
What to do if you are exposed
Because there is no cure for arsine exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it.
First, get fresh air by leaving the area where the arsine is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from arsine.
If arsine was released outside, move away from the area. If arsine was released indoors, get out of the building.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near an arsine release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Evacuation.""
For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, visit ""Responding to Sheltering in Place.""
When immediate care is needed
If you think you were exposed, take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any arsine from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.
For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit ""About Getting Clean.""
Treatment
Treatment involves providing supportive medical care in a hospital. Blood transfusions (transferring blood) and intravenous fluids (fluids injected directly into a vein) may be needed.
Some people may need to have their blood cleaned by a machine if their kidneys fail. This process is called dialysis.
Long-term health effects
If people survive the first exposure, long-term effects may include:
Kidney damage
Numbness and pain in the hands and feet
Neuropsychological symptoms (memory loss, confusion, and irritability)

About Soil-transmitted helminths
KEY POINTS
Soil-transmitted Helminths, or STH, are parasitic worms that live in the human intestine.
They spread through soil or water contaminated by human feces (poop) that contain the parasite larvae.
STH infections are considered neglected tropical diseases or NTDs.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities.
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer.
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are:
Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.
Contaminating drinking water sources.
Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.
Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil.
Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.
Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.
Hookworm
You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.
Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.
One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Blood and protein or nutrient loss
Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)
Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections
Wash your hands before handling food.
Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.
Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.
Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or ""preventive chemotherapy"".
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other ""neglected tropical diseases"" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.

Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are:
Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.
Contaminating drinking water sources.
Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.
Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil.
Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.
Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.
Hookworm
You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.
Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.
One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Blood and protein or nutrient loss
Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)
Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections
Wash your hands before handling food.
Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.
Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.
Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or ""preventive chemotherapy"".
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other ""neglected tropical diseases"" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.

About Viral Meningitis
KEY POINTS
Meningitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.
A bacterial or viral infection can cause the swelling.
Viral meningitis is the most common type of meningitis.
Most people get better on their own without treatment, but it can be very serious.
What it is
Many viruses can cause meningitis. Leading U.S. causes include:
Arboviruses, such as West Nile virus
Herpesviruses
Influenza virus
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
Measles virus
Mumps virus
Non-polio enteroviruses (most common)
Herpesviruses include:
Epstein-Barr virus
Herpes simplex viruses
Varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles)
Symptoms
People with viral meningitis usually start having typical meningitis symptoms.
When to seek emergency care
Anyone with symptoms of meningitis should see a healthcare provider right away. A healthcare provider can determine if you have meningitis, what's causing it, and the best treatment.
Risk factors
Anyone can get viral meningitis; however, the following factors can increase someone's risk.
Age
Children younger than 5 years old are at increased risk for viral meningitis.
Babies younger than 1 month old are most likely to have severe illness if they get viral meningitis.
Medical conditions
People with a weakened immune system are at increased risk for getting viral meningitis and having severe illness. Diseases, some medications (such as chemotherapy), and recent organ or bone marrow transplantations can weaken the immune system.
Close contacts aren't likely to develop meningitis
Close contacts of someone with viral meningitis can become infected with the virus that made that person sick. They aren't likely to develop meningitis though.
How it spreads
The table below summarizes the most common ways these viruses spread. Visit specific CDC websites for more detailed information.
Arboviruses
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
Spread through specific animal exposures, including bites, urine, or feces
Epstein-Barr virus
Mumps virus
Non-polio enteroviruses
Spread by sharing respiratory or throat secretions (saliva or spit) through close contact
Spread by items contaminated with those secretions
Influenza virus
Measles virus
Varicella-zoster virus
Spread through coughing, sneezing, or talking
Don't require close contact
Varicella-zoster viruses
Spread through contact with fluid from blisters
Non-polio enteroviruses
Spread through contact with other body secretions (feces, nasal mucus)
Spread by items contaminated with those secretions (diapers
Prevention
Limit virus exposure and spread
Many daily healthy habits can help prevent viral infections:
Wash your hands often, especially after changing diapers or using the toilet
Avoid close contact, such as touching and shaking hands, with people who are sick
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces
Stay home when sick and keep sick children out of school
Keep Reading:
About Handwashing
Vaccination
Vaccines can protect against some diseases that can lead to viral meningitis:
Chickenpox vaccines
Influenza vaccines
Measles and mumps vaccines
Shingles vaccines
Other prevention tips
Avoid bites from mosquitoes and other insects that carry diseases that can infect humans.
Avoid contact with wild mice. Take precautions when handling pet rodents like mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs.
Keep Reading:
Controlling Wild Rodent Infestations
Testing and diagnosis
There are laboratory testsingitis.
Treatment and recovery
In most cases, there's no specific treatment for viral meningitis. Most people with mild viral meningitis usually get better on their own within 7 to 10 days.
People who develop severe illness, or are at risk for developing severe illness, may need hospital care.
Antiviral medicines
Antiviral medicine may help people with meningitis caused by viruses such as herpesvirus and influenza.

AT A GLANCE
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes all fertility treatments or procedures in which either eggs or embryos are handled to help achieve a pregnancy.
See more information on the definition of ART below.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to a female patient or a gestational carrier. ART also includes egg and embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and egg and embryo donation. The most common type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF). Other types of ART, such as gamete intrafallopian transfer or zygote intrafallopian transfer, are rarely performed.
ART does NOT include treatments in which only sperm are handled (such as intrauterine insemination). It also does NOT include procedures in which a woman takes drugs only to stimulate egg production without planning to have the eggs surgically retrieved.

Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality
AT A GLANCE
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protects privacy and confidentiality in accordance with federal laws.
CDC uses Certificates of Confidentiality and other resources to protect identifiable and potentially identifiable information.
Overview
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commits to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information we have, in accordance with federal laws. The Privacy and Confidentiality Unit (PCU) provides guidance on privacy and confidentiality for all federally funded and supported activities through consultation and issuance of Assurances of Confidentiality to CDC programs.
Privacy
CDC provides technical support and education to CDC employees; grantees; partners; and state, Tribal, and local health departments on:
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
Other federal privacy laws.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
The HIPAA Privacy Rule
(45 CFR Parts 160
and 164
) regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, called protected health information (PHI), by covered entities. The Privacy Rule protects all PHI transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g. electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity or its business associates. It excludes certain educational and employment records.
The Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights in respect to their health information including, but not limited to, the right to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of their privacy rights and how their PHI will be used and disclosed.
The Privacy Rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without the written authorization from the individual; however, there are several exceptions to this requirement including disclosures
for public health activities.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g
; 34 CFR Part 99
) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Health care information is generally part of the education record. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
FERPA gives parents certain rights regarding their child's education record. These rights include the right to inspect and request corrections to the record. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.
FERPA generally prohibits the disclosure of any personally identifiable information contained in an education record without the appropriate written consent. FERPA offers limited exceptions to this requirement.
Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality (CoCs) protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable and potentially identifiable research information, with limited exceptions.
Any investigator or institution issued a CoC shall not:
Disclose or provide covered information, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding.
Disclose or provide covered information to any other person not connected with the research.
CDC investigators with a CoC may ONLY disclose identifiable and potentially identifiable information in the following circumstances:
If required by other federal, state, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases.
If the subject consents.
For the purposes of scientific research that is compliant with human subjects' regulations.
CoCs cover any CDC-funded research project collecting or using identifiable and potentially identifiable information, in compliance with Section 301(d)
of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). All CDC-funded research activities are automatically issued a CoC through their award. No physical certificate will be issued. The CoC will apply as a term and condition of award. This applies to:
Grants.
Cooperative Agreements.
Contracts.
CDC-sponsored intramural research.
For research activities enrolling human participants, CDC requires investigators to inform participants of the CoC protections and the limits to those protections.
Assurance of Confidentiality
An Assurance of Confidentiality (AoC) is a formal confidentiality protection authorized under Section 308(d)
of the PHSA. CDC investigators use it to collect or maintain sensitive identifiable information from individuals and institutions. The law states that no identifiable information may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied. The exception is if such institution or individual consented to that disclosure. Protected information includes identifiable information on institutions or individuals who are the subjects of non-research, public health activities with an approved AoC.
CDC implements agency AoC protection for public health activities conducted by CDC investigators that involve the collection or maintenance of identifiable information. This protection allows CDC programs to assure individuals and institutions involved in non-research activities (e.g., surveillance) that those conducting the activity will protect the confidentiality of the identifiable data collected.
Disclosures can be made without individual authorization only for purposes stated at the time of data collection or specifically consented to thereafter by each of the parties provided the promise of confidentiality.

Flu and People with Asthma
AT A GLANCE
Asthma is a lung disease that is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways.
People with asthma are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, even if their asthma is mild or their symptoms are well-controlled by medication.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people with asthma because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications.
People with asthma who get flu symptoms should call their health care provider right away. There are antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness and help prevent serious flu complications.
About asthma
Asthma is a lung disease that is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways. It is one of the most common long-term diseases among children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma attacks occur when the lung airways tighten due to inflammation. Asthma attacks can be caused by ""triggers"" such as respiratory infections, allergy particles, chemical irritants, and air pollution. During an asthma attack, a person with asthma can experience symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Often, asthma attacks can be prevented by limiting one's exposure to triggers and by properly using asthma medications.

Asthma
Flu and people with asthma
People with asthma can develop swollen and sensitive airways, and flu can cause further inflammation of the airways and lungs. Flu can trigger asthma attacks and cause worsening of asthma symptoms. Flu also can lead to pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases. In fact, adults and children with asthma are more likely to develop pneumonia after getting sick with flu than people who do not have asthma. Asthma is the most common medical condition among children hospitalized with flu and one of the more common medical conditions among adults hospitalized with flu.
Prevention
A flu shot is the best protection against flu
Flu vaccination is especially important for people with asthma because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications.
Keep Reading:
Benefits of flu vaccination
Flu vaccines for people with asthma
Most injectable influenza vaccines (or flu shots) are approved for use in people 6 months and older, regardless of whether or not they have asthma or other health conditions. Flu shots have a long-established safety record in people with asthma.
People with asthma should generally not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine (i.e., the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV).
People with asthma who are aged 5 years and older, talk to your health care provider before getting the nasal spray vaccine.
Children 2 to 4 years old who have asthma or who have had a history of wheezing in the past 12 months should not get the nasal spray vaccine.

Pneumococcal vaccination is also important
Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death.
People who have asthma should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccination helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections.
You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine.
Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.
Keep Reading:
Pneumococcal Vaccination
Specific health actions for people with asthma
Take asthma medication exactly as your doctor or other medical professional tells you to do. Know how to use your asthma inhaler if your doctor of other medical professional tells you to use one.
Plan ahead to maintain sufficient supplies of your regular medications for chronic medical conditions (e.g., at least a two-week supply).
Know and avoid the asthma triggers that can cause you to have an asthma attack.
Follow an updated, written Asthma Action Plan developed with your health care provider.
Follow this Asthma Action Plan for daily treatment to control asthma long-term and to handle worsening asthma, or attacks.
If your child has asthma, make sure that their up-to-date written Asthma Action Plan is on file at school and/or at the daycare center. Be sure that the plan and medication(s) are easy to get to when needed.
Other preventive actions
In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with asthma should take the same everyday preventive actions CDC recommends for everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Respiratory Viruses
Symptoms and treatment
Because you are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, if you get sick with flu symptoms call your health care provider right away. There are antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness and help prevent serious flu complications.
Influenza antiviral drugs are medicines that fight against flu by keeping influenza viruses from making more viruses in your body. People with asthma should not use the antiviral drug zanamivir (trade name Relenza®) because there is a risk it may cause wheezing in people with asthma or other lung problems.

About Work-related Asthma
KEY POINTS
Asthma is a disease that affects your lungs.
Work-related asthma is triggered or develops from exposures at work.
Workplace irritants, allergens, and physical conditions are triggers.
Work-related asthma symptoms are the same as non-work related asthma.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Work-related asthma is asthma triggered by exposures at work. Asthma affects the lungs and causes the airways to become narrow and inflamed. To control it, avoid triggers that cause asthma symptoms and take prescribed medicine.
Many triggers can be in the workplace. Over 300 known substances in the workplace can cause or worsen asthma. Avoiding triggers can prevent asthma from getting worse.
Worsening asthma or new onset asthma in a worker should raise questions about workplace causes. Asthma symptoms can develop shortly after exposure. However, they can also develop months or years after repeated exposures to harmful substances.
Signs and symptoms
Coughing at work can be a symptom of work-related asthma.
Symptoms of work-related asthma are the same as symptoms for non-work-related asthma. They include:
Wheezing
Coughing
Chest tightness
Shortness of breath
Asthma symptoms can come and go, and some workers might not have all of the symptoms. Workers can get work-related asthma even when using personal protective equipment such as respirators or face masks. Sometimes breathing problems start at work and continue after leaving work when exposure has stopped.
How do I know if I have work-related asthma?
Symptoms for work-related asthma tend to get better on weekends, vacations, or other times when away from work. However, in some cases, symptoms do not improve until extended time away from exposures or triggers.
Your doctor can diagnose work-related asthma. Tell your doctor about work exposures and possible triggers including your job, tasks, and materials you use.
Also consider recording when and where your symptoms occur to help determine any patterns. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and will conduct a physical examination. The doctor might also order one or more tests, such as:
Breathing tests (e.g., peak flow readings, spirometry, methacholine challenge)
Allergy tests such as skin or blood tests
If your doctor is concerned about a condition other than asthma, he/she might order other tests such as x-rays or other imaging tests.
Causes
Exposures from indoor water damage can trigger work-related asthma.
Work-related asthma is associated with exposure to worksite triggers (irritants, allergens, and physical conditions). Examples of asthma triggers are:
Animal dander, insects, and dust mites
Chlorine-based cleaning products
Cigarette smoke
Materials from cockroaches
Cold air
Dust from wood, grain, flour, or green coffee beans
Gases such as ozone
Other possible triggers include:
Irritant chemicals
Metal dust
Physical exertion
Pollen and plants
Strong fumes
Vapors from chemicals (e.g., ammonia, isocyanates, and solvents)
Wood smoke
Symptom management
Inhalers are often used to treat asthma attacks.
The most important step of managing asthma is stopping or reducing exposure to triggers causing symptoms. Work with your doctor to develop a personal asthma control plan. Medical professionals often treat asthma with two general types of medicine:
Quick-relief rescue inhalers (e.g., albuterol, levalbuterol) to open the airways. People use these medicines to treat asthma attacks or flare-ups. Quick relief medications are often used in combination with long-term control medicines such inhaled corticosteroids.
Long-term control medicines to reduce inflammation in the airways. People use these medicines to help keep asthma symptoms from occurring. When these medicines are working well, quick relief medicine is not used as much.

About Atrial Fibrillation
KEY POINTS
Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia.
Some people who have AFib don’t know they have it and don’t have any symptoms.
What it is
Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way.
When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart (the two atria) is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart (the two ventricles). AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition.
This illustration shows a normal heartbeat and an irregular heartbeat.
Facts about AFib
It is estimated that 12.1 million people in the US will have AFib in S12
In 2021, AFib was mentioned on 232,030 death certificates and was the underlying cause of death in 28,037 of those deaths.3
People of European descent are more likely to have AFib than Black people.
Because the number of AFib cases increases with age and women generally live longer than men, more women than men experience AFib.
Symptoms
Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms:
Irregular heartbeat.
Heart palpitations (rapid, fluttering, or pounding).
Lightheadedness.
Extreme fatigue.
Shortness of breath.
Chest pain.
Risk factors
The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib.4
Risk factors for AFib include:45
Advancing age.
High blood pressure.
Obesity.
European ancestry.
Diabetes.
Heart failure.
Ischemic heart disease.
Hyperthyroidism.
Chronic kidney disease.
Moderate to heavy alcohol use.
Smoking.
Enlargement of the chambers on the left side of the heart.
How is AFib related to stroke?
AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke.6 AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes.7
Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment for AFib can include:
Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate.
Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk.
Surgery.
Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors.
What are the consequences of AFib?
More than 454,000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US.4 The condition contributes to about 158,000 deaths each year.3 The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades.7

KEY POINTS
CDC's Division of Blood Disorders and Public Health Genomics (DBDPHG) works to promote health, prevent disease, and reduce health inequities for people at increased genetic risk across the lifespan, so they can have the opportunity to be as healthy as possible.
Overview
Thousands of inherited genetic disorders affect millions of people in the United States. Many people with genetic disorders are more likely to
Have health problems.
Require specialized care.
Be hospitalized.
Have higher healthcare costs.
Need to take time off work or school.
Die at a younger age.
In addition, many people with genetic disorders face barriers to health equity that are related to social determinants of health. Social determinants of health refer to conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect health and quality of life. CDC's Division of Blood Disorders and Public Health Genomics (DBDPHG) works to promote health, prevent disease, and reduce health inequities for people with genetic disorders of all ages, so they can be as healthy as possible.

Thimerosal and Vaccines
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS |
PAGE 9 OF 9 | ALL PAGES
KEY POINTS
Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that has been used for decades in the United States in multi-dose vials (vials containing more than one dose) of medicines and vaccines.
There is no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines, except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site.
In July 1999, the Public Health Service agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines as a precautionary measure.
Overview
About thimerosal
Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust, air, soil, and water. Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed — methylmercury and ethylmercury — are very different.
Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic to people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible out of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some methylmercury.
Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body more quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm.
Purpose of thimerosal
Thimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) to prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi.
Introduction of bacteria and fungi has the potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for administration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, serious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added during the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth.
Removal of thimerosal
Fact
Thimerosal was taken out of childhood vaccines in the United States in 2001.
Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines do not and never did contain thimerosal.
Varicella (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal.
Influenza (flu) vaccines are currently available in both thimerosal-containing (for multi-dose vaccine vials) and thimerosal-free versions.
For a complete list of vaccines and their thimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Thimerosal in Vaccines
page.
What the research shows
Fact
Thimerosal use in medical products has a record of being very safe. Data from many studies show no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines.123456
The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people may be allergic to thimerosal.
No connection with autism
Research does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Many well conducted studies have concluded that thimerosal in vaccines does not contribute to the development of autism.135 Even after thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to increase, which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism.
Fact
A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal does not increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1
No association with neuropsychological delays
Studies have assessed the possible association between ethyl mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and neuropsychological functioning including an objective measurement of neuropsychological functioning.
Fact
Research shows no association between thimerosal exposure and neuropsychological delays.24
Timeline: Thimerosal in Vaccines
2010
September 13. Results of a CDC study do not support an association between prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal and an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
2009
February 1. Results of an Italian study
 were reassuring that immunization in infancy with thimerosal-containing vaccines does not decrease neuropsychological performance later in childhood.
2007
September 27. Results of a CDC study
 do not support an association between early exposure to thimerosal in vaccines and neuropsychological problems in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years.
July 7. CDC issues a statement on autism and thimerosal that states in part: “Some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal (from the addition of important vaccines recommended for children) explains the higher prevalence [of autism] in recent years. However, evidence from several studies examining trends in vaccine use and changes in autism frequency does not support such an association.”
2006
September 26. In a statement prepared for the Coalition for Mercury-free Drugs, the FDA concludes that the evidence reviewed by the IOM in 2004 does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.
2004
May 28. ACIP recommends that children between the ages of 6 and 23 months routinely receive an inactivated influenza (flu) vaccine. ACIP does not recommend using the thimerosal-free flu vaccine over the thimerosal-containing flu vaccine, and states that the benefits of flu vaccination outweigh any risk from thimerosal exposure.
May 17. After reviewing over 200 scientific studies that examined thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, IOM concludes in a report
 that the studies “consistently provided evidence of no association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.”
2003
November. A study
 finds no consistent significant associations between exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines and a variety of kidney, nervous system, and developmental problems.
August. Another study
 looks for a link between autism incidence and the use of thimerosal-containing vaccines. The study does not find a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism in Denmark and Sweden, where autism rates continued to increase although thimerosal was removed from vaccines in 1992.
January. The last children’s vaccines that use thimerosal as a preservative expire 
.
2001
Except for influenza (flu), thimerosal is removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and under manufactured for the U.S. market.
October 1. IOM’s Immunization Safety Review Committee issues a report
 concluding there is not enough evidence to disprove claims that thimerosal in childhood vaccines causes autism, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, or speech or language delay.
May 5. A risk assessment
 of thimerosal use in childhood vaccines finds no evidence of harm from the use of thimerosal as a preservative, other than redness and swelling at the injection site.
2000
June 7 and 8. Fifty-one vaccine and vaccine safety researchers and experts meet in Atlanta, GA to review data regarding thimerosal in vaccines and nervous system disorders. A report summarizing the meeting was presented to ACIP.
1999
The FDA reviews
 the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines and finds no evidence of harm, but as a precautionary measure, recommends removing thimerosal from vaccines routinely given to infants.
November 5. CDC states that vaccine manufacturers, FDA, and other agencies are working together to reduce the amount of thimerosal in vaccines, or to replace them with thimerosal-free vaccines, as soon as possible.
October 20. ACIP reviews information about thimerosal in vaccines provided by CDC’s National Immunization Program and several vaccine manufacturers regarding the availability of vaccines that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative.
July 7. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service issue a joint statement that says “There is no data or evidence of any harm caused by the level of exposure that some children may have encountered in following the existing immunization schedule.” The American Academy of Family Physicians issues a comparable statement soon after.
Frequently asked questions
What is thimerosal?
Thimerosal is a vaccine additive, added to some vaccines to prevent germs (like bacteria and fungi) from growing in them. If germs grow in vaccines, they can cause illness—or even death.
Why do some people worry about thimerosal in vaccines?
You may have heard that thimerosal has mercury in it. Not all types of mercury are the same. Some types of mercury, like mercury in some kinds of fish, stay in the human body and can make people sick. Thimerosal is a different kind of mercury. It doesn’t stay in the body, and is unlikely to make us sick.
Is thimerosal safe?
Yes. Thimerosal has been used safely in vaccines for a long time (since the 1930s).
Scientists have been studying the use of thimerosal in vaccines for many years. They haven’t found any evidence that thimerosal causes harm.
Is thimerosal still used in vaccines for children?
No. Thimerosal hasn't been used in vaccines for children since 2001.
However, thimerosal is still used in some flu vaccines. Yearly flu vaccines are recommended for all children. If you are worried about thimerosal, you can ask for a flu vaccine without it.
Does thimerosal cause autism?
No. Research does not show any link between thimerosal and autism.

Vaccines and Autism
Are there side effects from thimerosal in vaccines?
Most people don't have any side effects from thimerosal, but some people will have mild side effects like redness and swelling at the place where the shot was given, which will only last 1 to 2 days. It's very unlikely you will have an allergic reaction to thimerosal.
How can I find out if thimerosal is in a vaccine?
Ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Ask to see the vaccine's list of ingredients. All vaccine packages come with information (called an insert) that lists the ingredients.

Avian Flu in the Workplace
KEY POINTS
Avian influenza, also called bird flu, is a disease caused by infection with avian influenza A viruses.
Bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans.
However, the disease can infect unprotected people who work with infected animals, or contaminated materials or surfaces.
This page provides information for people with exposure to wild or domesticated birds.
Overview
Current Situation
This page focuses on protecting people with exposure to wild or domesticated birds. If you're looking for information on the ongoing multi-state outbreak, please view the current situation summary.
Infected birds shed virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare.
Workers can get infected if they breathe in virus in the air. They can also get infected if they touch something with virus on it and then touch their mouth, eyes, or nose. People may be exposed to the virus if they work with:
Infected wild birds or poultry that are sick or dead
Infected birds' droppings
Contaminated litter
Contaminated materials or surfaces like egg collection containers
At-risk populations
Workers at risk
Broiler breeder farms, hatcheries, grow-out farms, and processing plant workers
Layer farm workers
Turkey farm workers
Disease control and eradication workers (federal, contract, and company workers)
Live-bird market workers
Wildlife biologists who handle birds
Animal control, welfare, and rescue workers who handle infected animals
Areas at risk
Outbreaks occur occasionally around the world. Outbreaks in poultry were associated with illness and death in humans in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. While very rare, some bird flu viruses caused illness in humans in North America.

Prevention
Resource
Poultry workers should take steps to protect themselves from avian influenza. The NIOSH Alert: Protecting Poultry Workers from Avian Influenza provides recommendations for workers and is available in English, Spanish, and French.
Infections typically happen after someone has close, prolonged and unprotected contact with infected birds and touches their mouth, eyes, or nose. Unprotected contact means no gloves or other personal protective equipment (PPE). Anyone likely to have exposure to bird flu viruses should take protective measures.
