How Water Treatment Works
KEY POINTS
Drinking water utilities treat water to remove harmful germs and chemicals and meet safety standards.
Utilities must make sure the water they deliver to your tap is safe to drink.
Different utilities will use different treatment steps depending on the initial quality of the water.
How it works
View LargerDownload
Water utilities pipe water from its source to a water treatment plant, which cleans water to make it safe to drink.
Water utilities often use a series of water treatment steps that include coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection.
Water treatment steps
Coagulation is often the first step in water treatment. Treatment plant staff add chemicals to the water that help bind together dirt and other small particles. The chemicals they commonly use include specific types of salts, aluminum, or iron.
Flocculation is next. Flocculation is the gentle mixing of the water to form larger, heavier particles called flocs. Often, treatment plant staff will add additional chemicals during this step to help the flocs form.
Sedimentation separates out solids from the water. Flocs are heavier than water, so they settle to the bottom of the water during this step.
Filtration is the next step. Once the flocs have settled to the bottom of the water, the clear water on top goes through several filters.
The filters have different pore (hole) sizes and are made of materials such as sand, gravel, or charcoal. These filters remove germs, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. They also remove dissolved particles, such as dust and chemicals. Activated carbon filters remove bad smells.
Utilities that use a process called ultrafiltration put water through a filter with very small pores. This filter only lets through water and other small molecules (such as salts and tiny, charged molecules).
Reverse osmosis
is another way to filter water that removes additional particles from water. Water treatment plants often use reverse osmosis when treating recycled water or salt water for drinking.
Disinfection is often the last step. Water treatment plants may add one or more chemical disinfectants to kill any remaining germs. Common types of chemical disinfectants include chlorine, chloramine, or chlorine dioxide.
Treatment plant staff make sure the water has low levels of the chemical disinfectant when it leaves the treatment plant. This remaining disinfectant kills germs living in the pipes between the water treatment plant and your tap.
Water treatment plants can also use ultraviolet (UV) light
or ozone
to disinfect water. They may use UV light or ozone instead of, or in addition to, chemical disinfectants. UV light and ozone work well to disinfect water in the treatment plant. However, these methods do not continue killing germs as water travels through the pipes between the treatment plant and your tap.
Adjusting pH and adding fluoride improves water
Water treatment plants commonly adjust water pH and add fluoride after the disinfection step. Adjusting the pH improves taste, reduces corrosion (breakdown) of pipes, and helps chemical disinfectants continue killing germs as the water travels through pipes. Drinking water with the right amount of fluoride keeps teeth strong and reduces cavities.
Water treatment differs by community
Different utilities use different treatment steps depending on the quality of the source water entering the treatment plant. Water from lakes, rivers, or reservoirs typically require more treatment than water from under the ground. This is because—compared to water from under the ground—lake, river, and reservoir water contain more:
Sediment (sand, clay, and other soil particles)
Germs
Chemicals
Toxins
Some water supplies contain specific chemicals or toxins that require utilities to use special treatment methods to control or remove them. These chemicals and toxins can include:
Nitrates
Radionuclides (small radioactive particles)
Toxins made by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)

Global Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)
Global Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
KEY POINTS
Global access to safe water, sanitation, and proper hygiene education can reduce illness and death from disease, improve health, reduce poverty, and help economic growth.
Every year, diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid fever cause millions of illnesses and deaths, yet they can be prevented with better WASH practices.
Overview
Everyone needs clean water, safe toilets, and good hygiene habits to stay healthy, but not everyone has access to these essentials. Today, millions of people around the world do not have clean water to drink, and billions do not have a safe place to go to the bathroom. This can lead to serious illnesses like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, which are especially dangerous for infants and children.
Access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene remains a significant global challenge, with over 2 billion people
lacking clean drinking water at home, 1.5 billion lacking basic sanitation facilities, and 2 billion lacking basic hygiene services
.
Universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene has the potential to greatly reduce global disease burden. Investing in water and sanitation interventions brings economic, environmental, quality of life, and health benefits. WASH also plays a key role in improving nutritional outcomes, particularly among children.
Global impact of waterborne infections
Unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene play a major role in spreading diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. These conditions also contribute to the emergence of more dangerous forms of diseases, such as extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever. Addressing these challenges requires dedicated efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices. These improvements are necessary for preventing the spread of disease and dealing with emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant infections.
Harmful germs, parasites, or toxic chemicals can contaminate water. This contaminated water comes from human or animal waste, pesticides, and industrial waste. This can make people sick with diseases like cholera, typhoid, polio, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five years old. The primary risk factors for diarrhea include unsafe water and sanitation, along with childhood malnutrition.
In addition, not having access to clean water, toilets, and good hygiene practices makes it harder to stop and manage neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis, trachoma, and Guinea worm disease. This keeps the cycle of poverty and sickness going. Having reliable access to safe water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices significantly reduces the burden of disease globally.
Key facts highlight the impact of these conditions:
Diarrhea is a major cause of mortality among children under five, with about 88% of these deaths attributable to WASH issues.
Cholera affects 47 countries, primarily impacting vulnerable populations, with efforts focusing on improving WASH and vaccination to prevent outbreaks.
Typhoid fever, notably its drug-resistant strains, underscores the importance of enhanced sanitation, hygiene, and vaccination efforts for prevention.
Improving WASH infrastructure and practices is key to breaking the cycle of disease and poverty and highlights the need for global efforts to ensure everyone has access to safe water and sanitation.

Drinking Water
Well Water Safety
KEY POINTS
If you have a privately owned well, you are responsible for making sure your tap water is safe to drink.
Proper well construction and continued maintenance help keep harmful germs and chemicals out of your well water.
Contact your health department for advice about testing your water and maintaining your well.
How it works
When rain falls, much of it goes into the ground. Water that is not used by plants moves downward through spaces in the rock. Water moves down until it reaches a dense layer of rock. The water trapped below the ground in the spaces above the dense rock is called ground water or an aquifer. We pump ground water up through wells.
View LargerDownload
We get water that is under the ground by drilling wells and pumping it out.
Types of wells
The main types of water wells are:
Dug or bored wells
Driven wells
Drilled wells
Knowing what type of well you have can help you maintain your well and keep your water safe. Looking at the cover and outside (casing) of your well may help you determine the type of well it is.
It is generally easier to keep harmful germs and chemicals out of drilled wells compared to dug, bored, or driven wells.

Learn About Private Water Wells | U.S. EPA
Private wells are not regulated
Tap water from private wells is not regulated, treated, or monitored by officials. The regulations that protect public drinking water systems do not apply to privately owned wells. Therefore, you are responsible for making sure your private well water is safe to drink.
Take steps to keep your well water safe. You can also contact your health department for advice about well water safety.
Private well definition
Typically, a private well or water system is not regulated if it:
Serves no more than 25 people at least 60 days of the year, and
Has no more than 15 service connections (buildings it serves)
The risks
Drinking polluted well water can make you sick. Your symptoms will depend on what type of harmful germ or chemical is in the water.
Well water can become unsafe to drink and use if it gets polluted by:
Leaks from landfills
Septic systems that are not working correctly
Leaks from underground fuel tanks
Fertilizers or pesticides
Water runoff from cities or industrial buildings
High levels of naturally occurring chemicals, such as arsenic or radon, in the land around a well
Poop from animal feedlots
Contact your health department for advice if you think your well water is polluted.
Keep Reading:
What Causes Tap Water Contamination
Steps to take
Proper well construction and continued maintenance help keep your well water safe.
Where to put your well
Locate your well a safe distance from possible sources of harmful germs and chemicals. Make sure your well is at least:
50 feet from septic tanks
50 feet from septic leach fields
50 feet from livestock yards
100 feet from petroleum tanks
100 feet from where liquid-tight manure is stored
100 feet from where fertilizer is stored or handled
250 feet from manure stacks
Keep your well water safe. Make sure your well is far enough away from sources of harmful germs and chemicals.
Maintaining your well
Regular maintenance is important to keep your well water safe. Get a well checkup every year, and test your water and check your well if you ever suspect a problem.
At least once each year:
Test your well water for harmful germs and chemicals
Check your well for mechanical problems and cleanliness
Even if you are not currently using your well, continue to maintain it if it might be used in the future.
Learn more about what to include in your annual well checkup on the National Groundwater Association's Well Owner website
.

Well Owner Routine Maintenance Practices | Wellowner.org
Retiring your well
If you are no longer using your well, you must retire it by filling and properly sealing it. Retiring your old well helps protect ground water and neighboring wells from getting contaminated with germs or chemicals. People or animals can also get hurt if they fall into a forgotten, crumbling well.
Contact your local water quality or environmental protection department
to learn what is required in your area to retire a well. In many states, well owners must document retired wells with these agencies.
Look for a well water systems contractor with the expertise and equipment to properly plug and seal the well you want to retire. For help finding a contractor, contact your local health department or environmental protection department
. You can also check these resources:

Agricultural Water
Agricultural Water and Your Safety
KEY POINTS
Agricultural water is essential for growing produce and can come from a variety of sources, like surface water, ground water, or municipal water systems.
Contaminated agricultural water poses risks to both crops and animals, potentially causing foodborne illness in people who consume fruits or vegetables exposed to it.
Overview
Agricultural water is water that is used to grow fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables. Agricultural water can be used for irrigation, pesticide and fertilizer applications crop cooling, frost control, harvesting, and processing.
Agricultural water is primarily utilized for irrigation purposes. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), irrigation water ranks as the second largest consumer of water, closely following thermoelectric power, and nearly three times the amount used for public water supply.1
Where it's found
Agricultural water is derived from diverse sources. Municipal water systems, both in urban and rural areas, can also be used for agricultural purposes. Typical sources of agricultural water include:
Surface water
Rivers, streams, and irrigation ditches
Open canals
Impounded water bodies like ponds, reservoirs, and lakes
Ground water
Springs
Wells
Possible health impacts
Contaminated agricultural water can pose significant health risks to both consumers and livestock.
Potential health effects include:
Foodborne illnesses
Gastrointestinal infections
Chronic health conditions
Prevention
The quality of agricultural water is important for public health. Proactive measures, such as effective planning and management of agricultural facilities, monitoring of water quality, and educating farmers about responsible irrigation practices, are essential. These preventive measures can help ensure the safety of agricultural water, protect the quality of food crops, and reduce waterborne and foodborne illnesses in the public.

About Bottled Water Safety
KEY POINTS
The United States has rules in place to protect you from getting sick from commercially bottled water.
Check the label on your bottled water for water quality information.
If you think you got sick from bottled water, contact your health department to report your illness.
Overview
Source
Bottled water can come from a variety of sources, such as public tap water systems or from under the ground (for example, mineral water). No matter its source, bottled water must meet safe drinking water standards.
Safety rules
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulates the safety of bottled water in the United States. FDA bases its bottled water standards on the safe drinking water rules for tap water.
FDA requires bottled water companies to:
Protect bottled water sources from germs and chemicals
Test water before and after it is bottled
Follow additional safety rules during processing, bottling, holding, and transport
Health risks
Bottled water contaminated with harmful germs or chemicals can make you sick. Symptoms depend on the type of germ or chemical in the unsafe water and can be mild to serious.
Anyone can get sick from unsafe water, but some people are at higher risk.

Bottled water can get contaminated by germs or chemicals:
At the water's source
If the company does not properly treat the water to remove germs and chemicals
During the manufacturing process
During shipping or storage
After people buy it
Report illnesses
If you think you got sick from bottled water, contact your health department. Reporting your illness can help them find out what caused you to get sick and prevent more illnesses.
Tips
Read the label
While there is currently no standard label for bottled water, labels often provide some water quality information.
Look on the bottle's label for:
Where the water came from (source)
How it was treated to make it safe for drinking (for example, reverse osmosis, distillation, or another treatment method)
A phone number or web address where you can learn more about the water's quality
Check CDC's About Home Water Treatment Systems page to see what types of germs and chemicals different water treatment methods remove.

Water, Sanitation, and Environmentally Related Hygiene (WASH)
About Hygiene
KEY POINTS
Hygiene refers to behaviors that can improve cleanliness and lead to good health.
A few examples of hygiene can include how you care for your body, how you care for your baby, or how you care for your home environment to stay fresh and clean.
Many diseases and conditions can be prevented through proper hygiene practices, such as covering your coughs and sneezes, washing hands after handling animals, and showering before you swim.
Overview
Hygiene can refer to a number of different practices that can help to keep you and others healthy. There are many ways you can keep yourself and your environment clean to promote healthy living. A few important practices include personal hygiene, proper infant diapering and feeding, and everyday cleaning.
Personal hygiene refers to regularly washing parts of the body and hair with soap and water (including washing your hands and feet), grooming nails, facial cleanliness, covering coughs and sneezes, and menstrual hygiene. Personal hygiene practices can help you to feel fresh and healthy.
Infant feeding hygiene involves the careful cleaning, sanitizing, and storage of infant feeding items, such as baby bottles and breast pump parts to prevent germs from contaminating milk.
Safe and healthy diaper hygiene at home or childcare settings reduces the spread of germs and prevents babies and caregivers from getting sick.
Everyday cleaning in places you spend time, like your home, facilities, and early care and education settings, are effective ways to prevent the spread of disease and illness by removing germs from surfaces.

Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance Reporting
About Waterborne Disease Surveillance
AT A GLANCE
Surveillance is the term for tracking illness and injury. Waterborne disease surveillance provides information that can help prevent future disease and outbreaks while providing important information on how germs, chemicals, or toxins spread, and which types of water are linked to people getting sick.
Importance of outbreak investigations
Although we enjoy safe drinking and recreational water in the United States, waterborne diseases still pose a threat to our health and productivity. Water contaminated with germs, chemicals, or toxins can lead to waterborne illness if you drink it, breathe it in, or it touches your skin, eyes, ears, or other mucous membranes. By collecting data on the types of water, water systems, settings, and agents (what spreads the disease) that are linked to waterborne illness, we improve our understanding of waterborne illnesses and can better guide prevention efforts.
Outbreak investigations help us learn more about the causes of outbreaks. Officials can learn what germs are causing waterborne illness, what types of water are involved, and what groups of people become ill. This knowledge can be used to control an outbreak and prevent additional illnesses. Outbreak surveillance enables public health agencies to learn lessons from these investigations to develop recommendations on how to prevent similar outbreaks from happening in the future.
Many of the germs that are spread by water can also be spread in other ways, including by eating contaminated food or by contact with an ill person or animal. People come in contact with water often each day, making it even harder to know which exposure might have made a person sick. Finally, it can take several days or even weeks to become ill after being exposed to a germ, making it difficult to pinpoint the place and time of exposure. Without an outbreak investigation, it can be difficult or impossible to link illnesses to water.
When a group of people become ill at the same time, an investigation that collects information on timing and location of exposures and illnesses (known as an epidemiologic investigation) can help determine where and when the outbreak started and what caused it. An outbreak investigation can sometimes identify a direct link between the illnesses and contaminated water and might identify the type of water, systems, or settings involved. This information is difficult to gather outside of an outbreak (such as with individual infections).
Detecting/Investigating waterborne diseases and outbreaks
Waterborne disease outbreak definition
For an event to be defined as a waterborne disease outbreak
Two or more people must be linked epidemiologically by time, location of exposure to water, and type of illness, and
This epidemiologic evidence must implicate water as the probable source of illness.
Environmental evidence implicating water as the source of infection (for example, water samples testing positive for germs) can strengthen evidence in a public health investigation, but the investigation must find an epidemiologic link between the illnesses and water for an event to be considered a waterborne disease outbreak.
Tracking disease
Public health officials have been tracking waterborne disease in the United States for more than 100 years. CDC has been overseeing national waterborne disease and outbreak tracking since 1971.
Surveillance data help guide efforts to reduce and prevent future outbreaks. Waterborne disease surveillance data have supported national efforts to develop drinking water regulations and have provided guidance for recreational water activities, such as CDC's Healthy Swimming program.
The national Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System (WBDOSS) collects data on waterborne disease and outbreaks associated with recreational water, drinking water, and environmental and undetermined exposures to water. The system collects data on the number of outbreak-associated illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths; agents; implicated types of water; water systems; and water settings. WBDOSS also collects information on single cases of waterborne illness caused by certain types of chemicals or germs.
Investigating and reporting
Investigating outbreaks
Public health officials investigate outbreaks to control them, to prevent additional illnesses, and to learn how to prevent similar outbreaks from happening. Anyone who suspects an outbreak is occurring should contact their local or state health department.
The 8 steps in an outbreak investigation are:
DETECT a possible outbreak
DEFINE and FIND cases
GENERATE hypotheses
TEST hypotheses using epidemiology, clinical data, and environmental investigation
IDENTIFY source of outbreak
CONTROL outbreak through remediation and outreach
DECIDE outbreak is over
PREVENT future outbreaks through summarizing, interpreting, and reporting findings
Several steps may happen at the same time in an outbreak investigation. Once a waterborne disease outbreak investigation ends, public health departments report outbreaks to WBDOSS.

Reporting outbreaks
Waterborne disease outbreaks became nationally notifiable in the United States in 2009. Public health agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Freely Associated States have primary responsibility for identifying and investigating waterborne outbreaks and reporting outbreaks voluntarily to CDC. From 1971 to 2008, outbreaks were reported using a paper form. Since 2009, outbreaks have been reported electronically through CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS).

Welding Fumes and Manganese
Welding Fumes and Manganese
KEY POINTS
Welding fumes are composed of metals and most fumes contain a small percentage of manganese.
Welders, their employers, and healthcare workers have expressed concerns about potential neurological effects associated with exposure to manganese in welding fumes.
Overview
Manganese is an essential nutrient. A healthy person with normal liver and kidney function can excrete excess dietary manganese. Inhaled manganese is of greater concern because it bypasses the body's normal defense mechanisms. This can lead to manganese accumulation and damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys and central nervous system.
Health effects
Male workers exposed to manganese also have a higher risk of fertility problems. Prolonged exposure to high manganese concentrations (>1 mg/m3) in air may lead to a Parkinsonian syndrome known as ""manganism."" Chronic exposure to the manganese-containing pesticide, maneb, may cause Parkinson-like symptoms. Parkinson-like symptoms may include tremors, slowness of movement, muscle rigidity, and poor balance.
Neurological and Neurobehavioral Effects
Numerous studies indicate that welders may be at increased risk of neurological and neurobehavioral health effects when exposed to metals such as lead, iron, and manganese. Carbon monoxide, heat, and stress can also contribute to neurological impairments in welders. Some studies indicate that welders exposed to low levels of manganese (<0.2 mg/m3) perform more poorly on tests of brain function and motor skills. These effects include changes in mood and short-term memory, altered reaction time, and reduced hand-eye coordination. Affected workers frequently show abnormal accumulations of manganese in the region of the brain known as the globus pallidus, which plays an important role in movement regulation.
Welder's Anthrax
NIOSH researchers identified a new occupational disease among metalworkers called welder's anthrax. It is a rare but serious disease caused by the bacteria that produces anthrax toxin. Research suggests that exposure to metal fumes might increase workers' risk for lung infection. This is true even with common, relatively harmless infectious agents. It is still mostly unknown how metal fumes cause this disease. Theories include that metal fumes (or iron) act as a growth nutrient for bacteria, enhance the binding of bacteria to lung tissues, or impair immune responses in the lung through oxidative stress.
Welding fumes are composed of metals and may contain small amounts of manganese.
Risk of exposure
Exposure to manganese dust occurs primarily in mining, ore-crushing, and metallurgical operations for iron, steel, ferrous and nonferrous alloys. Manufacturing of the following products can also lead to manganese exposure:
dry-cell batteries
anti-knock gasoline additives
pesticides (e.g., maneb)
pigments, dyes, and inks
incendiary devices
Manganese fumes are produced during metallurgical operations and several types of welding operations. The exposure can vary considerably depending on the amount of manganese in the welding wire, rods, flux and base metal. Confined space welding can significantly increase exposure to manganese fumes. For information about assessment of occupational exposure to manganese visit the NIOSH manganese topic page.
Welding in confined spaces can increase exposure to manganese fumes.

Western Equine Encephalitis Virus
About Western Equine Encephalitis
KEY POINTS
Western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito.
No human cases have been reported in the United States since the late 1990s.
Most people with WEE virus infection do not get sick, though some will develop fever, headache, body aches, or confusion.
There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat WEE.
Reduce your risk by taking steps to prevent mosquito bites.
Overview
Western equine encephalitis is caused by a virus most commonly spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. Most people infected with western equine encephalitis virus do not feel sick. However, the virus can cause some people to develop symptoms of a febrile illness (fever) or severe neurologic disease.
Western equine encephalitis virus has caused sporadic outbreaks of disease in horses and people from the late 1930s through the early 1980s in the United States. The last outbreak in the United States in people was in 1987, and since then, there have only been five cases of western equine encephalitis virus identified in the United States. The last reported case of western equine encephalitis occurred in 1999. Historically, the virus has been found in parts of North America, Central America, and South America.
Risk of infection is highest during mosquito season, which starts in the summer and continues through fall. You can reduce your risk of infection by preventing mosquito bites.

Soil-Transmitted Helminths
About Soil-transmitted helminths
KEY POINTS
Soil-transmitted Helminths, or STH, are parasitic worms that live in the human intestine.
They spread through soil or water contaminated by human feces (poop) that contain the parasite larvae.
STH infections are considered neglected tropical diseases or NTDs.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities.
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer.
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are:
Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.
Contaminating drinking water sources.
Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.
Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil.
Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.
Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.
Hookworm
You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.
Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.
One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Blood and protein or nutrient loss
Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)
Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections
Wash your hands before handling food.
Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.
Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.
Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or ""preventive chemotherapy"".
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other ""neglected tropical diseases"" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.
Melioidosis
About Melioidosis
KEY POINTS
Melioidosis is a bacterial infection in people and animals.
Melioidosis is spread through contact with contaminated soil, air, or water.
Cases may increase after hurricanes, heavy rain, and other severe weather events.
The disease is often confused for other conditions, making diagnosis difficult.
Melioidosis is treated with antibiotics.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Melioidosis is caused by bacteria called Burkholderia pseudomallei, or B. pseudomallei. It's spread to people and animals through direct contact with soil, air, or water contaminated by the bacteria. Cases may increase after hurricanes, heavy rain, and other severe weather events because the bacteria rise to the surface of the soil.
People can get melioidosis by:
Breathing in contaminated dust or water droplets
Having contact with contaminated soil or water, especially through skin breaks (cuts, scrapes, etc.)
It's very rare for people to get the disease from another person.
Many kinds of animals can get melioidosis, including:
Sheep
Goats
Pigs, hogs, boar
Horses
Cats
Dogs
Cows
B. pseudomallei is mostly found in tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where it causes widespread melioidosis. In the United States, B. pseudomallei occurs in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Gulf Coast area of the state of Mississippi. Most melioidosis illnesses in the United States occur in people who have traveled to areas where the disease is more common. Some cases have also occurred in people who have had contact with contaminated products made overseas.
Signs and symptoms
Melioidosis has a wide range of signs and symptoms. You usually develop symptoms of melioidosis within 1 to 4 weeks after you've been exposed to it. Some cases have developed symptoms months or years after exposure. The disease can affect one body system or affect the entire body. Because of these factors, melioidosis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for other diseases.
Sometimes the illness is just in one area (localized), and it may look like an ulcer or skin sore. You might have a fever, swelling, and muscle aches.
Most often, melioidosis shows up as a lung infection. You might have a cough, chest pain, high fever, headache, and you might not feel like eating.
Whether you've just come down with melioidosis or you've had it for a long time, it can affect different organ systems throughout the body (disseminated infection). It can cause problems with the liver, spleen, prostate, joints, bones, lymph nodes, skin, or brain. Melioidosis can lead to a dangerous bloodstream infection (sepsis).
Symptoms of disseminated infection include:
Fever
Headache
Trouble breathing
Stomach or chest pain
Muscle pain
Confusion
Seizure
Risk factors
Although healthy people may get melioidosis, having the following medical conditions may increase your risk:
Diabetes
Heavy alcohol use
Liver disease
Kidney disease
Thalassemia (a blood disorder)
Cancer, or another condition that weakens the immune system
Chronic lung disease, like cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or bronchiectasis
Certain activities also may increase your risk of being exposed to the bacteria that causes melioidosis, including:
Travel to areas where the disease is common.
Breathing in contaminated water droplets or soil dust that get into the air after severe weather like hurricanes or heavy rainfall.
Hobbies or jobs that could put you in contact with contaminated soil or water.
Drinking unchlorinated or untreated drinking water.
Reducing risk
In areas where the disease is widespread, contact with contaminated soil or water can put people at risk for melioidosis. To help lower the risk of exposure:
If you have open skin wounds, or if you have chronic conditions like diabetes or kidney disease, avoid contact with soil and standing water.
If you perform agricultural work or have hobbies or jobs that raise your risk of exposure, wear boots, which can prevent infection through your feet and lower legs.
Healthcare workers can use standard precautions when treating patients with melioidosis to help prevent infection. They should also label samples appropriately if they suspect melioidosis to protect lab personnel.
Laboratory personnel should follow good laboratory practices, including using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protection.
Treatment and recovery
If you are diagnosed with melioidosis, doctors will decide how long you'll need treatment based on how bad the infection is. Treatment generally includes:
Intravenous (in the vein) antibiotics from 2 to 8 weeks, followed by
Oral (pills by mouth) antibiotics for 3 to 6 months
It's important to complete your treatment so that the infection goes away completely.
What CDC is doing
One reason public health authorities study the disease is because the bacteria that cause melioidosis might be used as a weapon in a biological attack. A biological attack is the intentional release of pathogens (germs) that can sicken or kill people, livestock, or crops.
We don't know if this kind of attack will ever happen. CDC and other federal agencies prepare for many of biological attacks to protect as many people as possible.
Keep Reading:
Melioidosis and Bioterrorism
CDC works with state, tribal, local, and territorial agencies to investigate potential cases of melioidosis. Among other cases, in 2021, CDC linked four cases of melioidosis in patients from Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas. A public health investigation eventually linked all cases to a commercially imported product from a melioidosis-endemic country that each of the patients used in their homes.
B. pseudomallei was recently found to occur naturally in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. CDC is working with health departments to learn more about how widespread the bacteria is and what impact it's having on health.
Whooping Cough (Pertussis)
Whooping Cough Vaccination
KEY POINTS
CDC recommends whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination for everyone.
Whooping cough vaccines are the best way to protect against whooping cough.
These vaccines work well, but protection fades over time.
Talk to a vaccine provider if you have questions about whooping cough vaccines.
Overview
CDC recommends whooping cough vaccines for people of all ages.
There are 2 types of combination vaccines that include protection against whooping cough:
DTaP
Tdap
The letter ""T"" in DTaP and Tdap shows they also help protect against tetanus. The letter ""D/d"" in DTaP and Tdap shows they also help protect against diphtheria.

Whooping Cough Vaccine Recommendations
Allergies, reactions: Talk with a vaccine provider
Talk to a vaccine provider about your vaccination history and a specific vaccine's ingredients. There may be times when someone shouldn't get DTaP or Tdap, like if they:
Had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the vaccine(s)
Have a life-threatening allergy to any part of the vaccine(s)
Additionally, discuss with a vaccine provider if a different vaccine other than DTaP or Tdap should be used. A vaccine provider may recommend a different vaccine if someone experienced encephalopathy within 7 days of receiving DTaP or Tdap. Encephalopathy is a brain disease that alters how the brain functions.
Feeling sick?
Generally, vaccination is fine during mild illnesses like a cold. A vaccine provider can advise on whether to get vaccinated or wait until you feel better.
Other guidelines
Tell the vaccine provider if you or your child:
Has seizures or another nervous system problem
Has ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (also called ""GBS"")
Had severe pain or swelling after a tetanus or diphtheria vaccine
How well they work
Vaccines that help protect against whooping cough work well but protection decreases over time.
Keep Reading:
How Well Whooping Cough Vaccines Work
Possible side effects
Most people who get a vaccine that helps protect against whooping cough don't have any serious problems. With any medicine, including vaccines, there's a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days, but serious reactions are possible.
Mild problems
DTaP vaccine
Swelling or soreness where the vaccine provider gave the vaccine
Fever
Irritability (fussiness)
Feeling tired
Loss of appetite
Vomiting
Tdap vaccine
Pain, redness, or swelling where the vaccine provider gave the vaccine
Mild fever
Headache
Feeling tired
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomachache
More serious reactions
More serious reactions after DTaP vaccination happen much less often than mild problems. They can include:
Seizures
Non-stop crying for 3 hours or more
High fever (over 105°F)
Rarely, DTaP vaccination is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg. While rare, if it happens it's usually in older children when they receive their fourth or fifth shot.

Healthy Pets, Healthy People
Wildlife
WHAT TO KNOW
Diseases can spread between people and wild animals.
Getting too close to wild animals can result in injury to you or the animal.
Always enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Don't keep wild animals as pets.
Overview
Wildlife are undomesticated animals living in nature. Wildlife have countless benefits for the ecosystem and for our health and wellbeing, including pollinating our food, controlling pests, and being a source of beauty and inspiration. Seeing wildlife while outside can be a fun and educational experience, and spending time outside in nature can have health benefits. However, it's important to know how to interact with wildlife safely to reduce your risk for certain injuries or illnesses. This also helps keep wildlife safe and healthy.
Wildlife may look cute or seem friendly, but they should always be enjoyed from a distance. Getting too close to wildlife may cause some animals to abandon their young, stop eating, or injure people or pets out of fear. Wildlife can also get sick from or have diseases that are harmful to people and pets. People and pets can spread diseases to wildlife, too. The best ways to keep yourself, your pets, and wildlife healthy are to keep a safe distance and wash your hands after being outdoors. Also, wildlife should never be kept as pets.
Diseases
Common diseases that wildlife can spread are listed below:
Aeromoniasis
Anthrax
Racoon Roundworm (Baylisascaris)
Botulism
Bovine tuberculosis
Brucellosis
Cryptococcosis
Dermatophilosis
(Lumpy wool, Strawberry foot rot, rainscald, rainrot)
Echinococcosis
Giardiasis
Hantavirus
Histoplasmosis
Leptospirosis
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis
Mycobacteriosis
(Fish Tank Granuloma, Swimming Pool Granuloma)
Plague
Rabies
Rat-bite fever
Salmonellosis
Tickborne diseases
Trichinellosis (Trichinosis)
Tularemia
Vesicular stomatitis
Vibriosis
West Nile virus
How to stay healthy around wildlife
Even animals that look and act healthy can carry germs that can make people sick.
Wash your hands
Wash your hands with soap and running water:
After contact with wild animals or their poop
After spending time outdoors
After spending time in places where wild animals might have been (like gardens, sheds, attics, and cabins)
After touching or cleaning your bird feeder or bird bath
Before you eat or drink
Supervise handwashing for young children.
Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available.
Keep your distance from wildlife
Keep your distance from wild animals to keep yourself and animals safe.
When you get too close to wild animals, you risk hurting yourself or the animal, or even getting a disease. Be aware that even animals that look healthy can spread germs to people and other animals.
Stay a safe distance away
If an animal changes its behavior, you're too close. Stay on trails and follow visitor guidelines, including disposing of trash properly.
Call animal control right away if an animal is acting strangely or out of character.
Don't pet or feed wildlife
Slowly back away if a wild animal approaches you, even if it seems friendly. Feeding songbirds in your backyard is okay. Don't adopt wild animals or bring them into your home, even temporarily.
Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, even if they are someone else's pets.
Don't touch dead animals
Don't pick up or touch dead animals with your bare hands. Call animal control to remove any dead animals.
Be prepared before outdoor activities
Before visiting a new place, learn about its wildlife.
Be aware of biting insects, spiders, and venomous snakes in the area. Wear EPA-registered insect repellent, bring a first aid kit, and don't travel alone in remote areas.
Teach kids about outdoor safety around wildlife and while camping.
Filter and disinfect water before drinking from a stream. Even water that looks clean can be contaminated by wildlife poop.
Hunt safely
Always wear gloves when touching dead animals while hunting.
Hunters are at higher risk for certain diseases carried by wildlife. If you hunt, protect yourself and your family from diseases carried by wildlife:
Always wear gloves when handling dead animals, even if they are freshly killed.
Cover any open wounds in your skin when hunting or skinning animals.
Take precautions against ticks while hunting and check yourself for ticks afterwards. Remove ticks quickly.
Wash your hands after handling dead animals, meat, or skin and organs.
Cook meat safely and thoroughly.
Be aware that freezing, drying, smoking, and pickling do not kill all types of germs.
Protect your home and other buildings from wildlife
Protect your home from wild rodents that can spread disease.
Rodents can infest homes and spread disease. Learn how to practice effective rodent control in and around your home.
Keep Reading:
Controlling Wild Rodent Infestations
Keep pets safe around wildlife
Wild animals can injure or spread germs to pets.
Keep pets on a leash when they're outside in unfenced areas.
Always supervise pets when outdoors.
Don't let pets approach or interact with wildlife.
Don't let pets eat dead wild animals.
Ask your veterinarian how to protect your pets from diseases like rabies, leptospirosis, and Giardia infection.
Feed birds in your yard safely
Cleaning bird feeders helps keep you and birds healthy.
Feeding songbirds in your yard can be relaxing and entertaining. However, wild birds can spread diseases to pets and people. Feeding birds can attract other wildlife to your yard too. Follow the steps below to feed birds safely.
Don't touch wild birds
This includes handfeeding. If you find a sick or dead bird in your yard, do not touch it. Call your state wildlife agency
or wildlife rehabilitator
. Keep pets away from bird feeders, bird baths, and the surrounding areas.
Wash your hands
Wash your hands after touching bird food, bird feeders, or bird baths.
Clean your bird feeder
Clean your bird feeder and bird bath at least once each month. If they get dirty, you might need to clean them more often. Clean and refill your bird bath weekly or when it's visibly dirty.
Clean feeders outside your house when possible. If you clean it indoors, use a laundry sink or bathtub, and thoroughly clean and disinfect the area right after. Do not clean bird feeders in your kitchen or places where food is prepared or stored.
Follow these steps to clean and disinfect your bird feeder:
Soak in a diluted bleach solution (9 parts water and 1 part bleach) for at least 10 minutes.
Rinse with water to remove any remaining bleach solution.
Let it dry before refilling it.
If you find a sick or dead bird
Remove your feeder and bird bath for two weeks. Clean the feeder or bath outdoors.
Safely enjoy wildlife while traveling
Don't touch or feed wild animals while traveling.
Some popular tourism locations let you interact with wild animals. Many of these experiences are with animals that can carry germs, even if they look healthy and clean. Some attractions can even harm the animals. Some examples of wildlife attractions that can be unhealthy for you and the animal are:
Riding elephants: Elephants can carry the germs that cause tuberculosis. Elephants can also become aggressive without warning.
Swimming with pigs or dolphins: Pigs and dolphins can spread germs to people. You can get sick just by swimming near these animals.
Holding monkeys: Even monkeys that look healthy can spread germs to people. Monkeys can carry herpes B virus, monkeypox, tuberculosis, Ebola, and simian immunodeficiency virus.
""Skin-cleaning"" fish: Fish and their habitats (whether wild or domesticated) can have germs like Salmonella and Aeromonas
Petting large cats like cheetahs, leopards, tigers, or lions: Big cats can become aggressive.
Enjoying wildlife attractions is part of a fun vacation. However, it's important to research the organization before visiting; some places that call themselves sanctuaries are not actually safe or healthy environments for wildlife or for you. Typically, the organizations that are safest for people and animals are organizations that:
Don't let you touch or feed wild animals.
Touching or feeding wild animals, even those that are used to people, can be stressful for the animal. When animals are stressed, they are more likely to become aggressive or get sick.
Have rules about interacting with the animals and provide plenty of space between you and the animals.
Prevent bites and scratches
Bites and scratches from wild animals can cause injury and spread germs, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious. Keeping your distance from wild animals is the best way to prevent bites and scratches.
What to do if you are bitten or scratched by a wild animal
Wash bites and scratches
Wash wounds with warm soapy water immediately.
Seek medical attention, especially if
The animal looks sick or is acting unusual.
The wound or injury is serious (uncontrolled bleeding, unable to move, extreme pain, muscle or bone is showing, or the bite is over a joint).
The wound or site of injury becomes red, painful, warm, or swollen. This is especially important if the person bitten is younger than 5 years old, 65 or older, a pregnant woman, or has a weakened immune system.
It has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot.
Talk to a healthcare provider about whether you need a rabies shot.
Snake bites
See immediate medical attention for snake bites.
Snakes are important for a healthy environment. They eat rodents that spread germs and ticks, and some nonvenomous snakes even keep venomous snakes away from your yard. Most snakes are not venomous. People and pets who are bitten by snakes, even venomous ones, usually survive. However, you should always seek medical attention for snake bites.
Snakes bite only when they feel threatened or trapped. Stay safe by leaving snakes alone and giving them space.
Prevent snake bites at home
If you see a snake in your home, call animal control to remove it. Don't try to remove or trap it yourself.
Note the size, shape, and color of any snakes you see. Contact a wildlife professional if you're concerned about the snake being venomous.
Keep an eye on children and pets when they are playing outside.
Prevent rodent infestations around your home and remove brush or log piles from your yard. Rodents can attract snakes.
Prevent snake bites outside
Watch where you step, especially if you are not on a path, or if there are logs, fallen trees, water, or other places where snakes can hide.
Don't let pets put their faces into logs or thick bushes where snakes might hide.
If you see a snake, keep your pets away from it, and slowly walk around it. Give it plenty of space.
Learn which venomous snakes live in your area and how to identify them.
What to do if you are bitten by a snake
Try to remember what the snake looked like (size, color, head shape).
Move away from the snake. Keep pets and other people away from it.
If you are close to help, wash the wound with soap and water immediately and contact a medical professional.
If you are not close to help:
Remain calm and still if possible. Keep the area of the bite below heart level by sitting or lying down. This will slow the spread of venom if the snake is venomous.
Get to a doctor as soon as possible. Have someone call 911.
If you are alone, wash the wound and carefully cover it. Walk slowly to the nearest area where you can reach help or call 911.
Don't chase or try to kill the snake. If the snake feels threatened it might try to bite again.
Don't use a tourniquet or try to suck the venom out of the wound. This can make the injury worse.
What to do if your pet is bitten by a snake
Move your pet away from the snake. Don't chase the snake away or kill it.
Try to remember what the snake looked like (size, color, head shape).
Try to keep your pet calm.
If you are close to help, take your pet to a veterinarian right away.
If you are not close to help:
Carry your pet if possible. Carrying your pet will help slow the spread of venom.
If you can't carry your pet, wash the wound, keep it dry, and cover it. Walk slowly with your pet to the nearest area where you can get them to a vet.
How to keep wildlife healthy
The health of people, animals, and the environment are closely connected. Keeping wildlife healthy helps keeps you and your pets healthy.
Be responsible while outdoors
Keep pets on a leash while outdoors in unfenced areas. Pets can harm wild animals.
Don't feed or leave food outside for wildlife. When people feed or come in close contact with wild animals repeatedly, those animals can lose their fear of humans. This can cause wild animals to hurt people or pets or get themselves hurt while searching for food. Feeding wild animals can also change their natural migration patterns or behavior. Feeding songbirds is okay.
Protect wildlife in national parks and local recreational areas by staying on trails and following visitor guidelines, including disposing of trash properly. Leaving trash behind encourages animals to spend time in areas where people are visiting.
Leave orphaned, injured, and abandoned wildlife alone
Don't touch baby animals.
Don't touch animals that look injured or abandoned. When you try to help animals that look orphaned or abandoned
, you could just be causing them harm.
Most baby animals left alone are not orphaned or abandoned. Usually, their parent is nearby. Many animals leave their babies for hours or even days at a time. Parents might leave their babies to search for food or hide the babies from predators.
Baby birds often spend their first few days out of the nest on the ground. They didn't fall out of the nest. Instead, they are learning how to fly and survive on their own. Parents are usually still close by during this time.
Many injured animals heal on their own. You can cause more harm if you try to help. If an animal is badly injured or looks very sick, you should contact a wildlife rehabilitator or state wildlife office
that will connect you with a rehabilitator.
Don't adopt a wild animal or bring it into your home. This can make the animal dependent on humans, which lowers its chances for survival in the wild. In addition, inappropriate food or medicine could harm the animal.
Don't release unwanted pets outdoors
If you don't want your pet anymore, don't release it outdoors. Releasing pets isn't good for the animal or the environment. Most pets released outdoors will die, and some can threaten natural wildlife populations.
Find a new home for your pet:
Consider giving your pet to another experienced pet owner.
Contact a nearby pet store for advice on rehoming your pet.
Contact a local pet rescue group to see if they can help rehome your pet.
Contact a local aquarium or zoo to see if they would accept your pet.

WISEWOMAN
About WISEWOMAN
KEY POINTS
WISEWOMAN provides cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor assessments, referrals for treatment, and support for lifestyle change among participants aged 35–64 to reduce the risk for heart disease and stroke.
The program funds 35 recipients, including 32 states, 2 tribal organizations, and 1 US territory.
The program addresses social and economic factors to help participants make healthy lifestyle changes that allow them to achieve their best health.
Overview
The Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for WOMen Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) program extends preventive health services to achieve optimal cardiovascular health for women aged 35-64 who participate in the CDC-funded National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). The program helps participants understand and reduce their risk of CVD and benefit from early detection and treatment. With health equity as a guiding principle, WISEWOMAN provides culturally informed risk factor screenings and program services that are mindful of the social determinants of health. The preventive health services include assessing CVD risk factors and referring participants to services that reduce those risks through improved diet, physical activity, tobacco cessation, and medication adherence support.
WISEWOMAN currently funds 35 recipients, including 32 states, 2 tribal organizations, and 1 US territory. It focuses on advancing health equity and providing social support services to participants to aid their completion of healthy behavior support services.
WISEWOMAN approach
The WISEWOMAN program aims to identify women at the highest risk of CVD and improve the delivery of heart disease and stroke prevention services, particularly for those with hypertension. The objectives are to improve blood pressure control and reduce disparities in cardiovascular health.
WISEWOMAN helps integrate innovative, evidence-based strategies for heart disease and stroke prevention within health care systems and communities.
Examples of these evidence-based strategies:
Using a team-based care approach, which includes the patient and the patient's primary care provider, nurses, pharmacists, and community health workers, to care for patients with high blood pressure and other risk factors.
Supporting clinicians by providing tools and resources to help patients regularly measure their blood pressure at home.
Providing tools to pharmacists to work with patients to help them take their blood pressure medications as directed.
Providing skill-based training to encourage participants to improve their diet and increase physical activity.
Referring smokers to quit lines or other tobacco cessation resources.
Increasing the number of evidence-based lifestyle programs offered in communities.
Read a summary of the implementation of the WISEWOMAN Program's Core Strategies in Years 1 and 2 (2018–2020) and an evaluation of the program's successes.
The WISEWOMAN program served nearly 150,000 women between 2008 and 2013—91% of whom had at least one risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Over 100,000 women participated in a healthy lifestyle service to reduce their risk for heart disease and stroke. The services provided by each WISEWOMAN program vary, but all are designed to promote lifelong heart-healthy lifestyle changes.

Fatigue
About Fatigue and Work
AT A GLANCE
Fatigue can affect anyone and be related to many work-related factors.
Work-related fatigue can affect worker safety and health.
Employers and workers should work together to reduce fatigue risks and manage fatigue.
Overview
In workplace settings, fatigue is commonly associated with nonstandard schedules which disrupt or shorten sleep. Examples of nonstandard schedules include night shift work and extended work hours.
Fatigue can also be associated with other workplace factors, such as:
Stress
Physically or mentally demanding tasks
Working in hot environments
It can stem from several different factors and its effects extend beyond sleepiness.
Fatigue can:
Slow down reaction times
Reduce attention or concentration
Limit short-term memory
Impair judgment
High levels of fatigue can affect any worker in any job. It has serious consequences for worker safety and health.
To keep workers safe and healthy, employers should:
Learn the risks for fatigue-related events.
Identify the sources of fatigue.
Use strategies to prevent and manage fatigue.

Motor Vehicle Safety at Work
About Motor Vehicle Safety at Work
KEY POINTS
All workers are at risk of crashes, whether they drive light or heavy vehicles, or whether driving is a main or incidental job duty.
Work-related motor vehicle crashes have a societal and economic impact.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is working to make sure that those who operate vehicles or work near vehicles come home safely at the end of their workday.
Why it's important
Millions of workers drive or ride in a motor vehicle as part of their jobs. And, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of work-related deaths in the U.S.1 The type of company or job doesn't matter — the risk is there.
Work-related crashes include:
Single- or multiple-vehicle crashes, on or off public roadways, which occur on the job
Events in which a pedestrian worker (e.g., a law enforcement officer) is struck by a motor vehicle in operation, on or of a public roadway
Facts
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of work-related deaths in the U.S.1
From 2011-2022, more than 21,000 workers in the U.S. died in a work-related motor vehicle crash (35% of all work-related deaths).1
In 2022:
1,369 U.S. workers driving or riding in a motor vehicle off a public road died in a work-related crash (25% of all work-related deaths).1
An additional 510 deaths (9% of all work-related deaths) involved workers driving or riding in a motor vehicle off a public road, or pedestrians struck by motor vehicles.1
Motor vehicle crashes are the 1st or 2nd leading cause of death in every major industry group.1
In 2019 alone, work-related crashes cost employers $39 billion ($75,000 per nonfatal injury and $751,000 per death).2
What's being done
The Center for Motor Vehicle Safety (CMVS) within CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research and develops strategies to prevent work-related motor vehicle crashes and resulting injuries.
The CMVS prioritizes motor vehicle safety for:
Truck drivers
Drivers in other high-risk jobs (e.g., emergency medical services workers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, oil and gas extraction workers)
Drivers of light vehicles (passenger cards, SUVs, pickup trucks)

Workers’ Compensation Studies
About Workers' Compensation Data
KEY POINTS
Workers’ compensation systems give protection to workers who are injured or become ill from their job.
These systems also give employers incentives to reduce work-related injury and illness.
These systems are governed by state law.
Overview
Workers’ compensation systems began as a way to give protection to workers who are injured or become ill from their job. They also give employers incentives to reduce work-related injury and illness. These systems are governed by state laws.
Most employers buy workers’ compensation insurance coverage through private insurers or state-certified compensation insurance funds. Larger employers may have the option to self-insure.
Types of workers' compensation data
Claims Information
Workers' compensation claims may be filed after a worker is injured or becomes ill due to their job. Claims include:
The nature of injury/illness
How the injury/illness occurred
The type and cost of medical care received
Cost of partial wage replacement
The number of days off work
Occupation, age, sex, time with employer, etc.
Employer Information
Insurers and employers collect data on:
The types of hazards present in the workplace
Safety/health programs and controls in place
Return-to-work programs to reduce injury/illness severity
How it works
There is no central source for workers' compensation data in the United States. Each state collects some information for private industry, state, and local government employers.
The federal government maintains separate workers' compensation databases for federally-governed employers.
Organizations such as the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI)
, and the Workers Compensation Research Institute
also collect data in many states.
Standardized data coding systems are used in many states. NCCI and independent state rating bureaus have developed coding systems for industry risk classifications. The Workers' Compensation Insurance Organizations (WCIO)
have developed a coding system for injury cause, nature, and part of body.
The International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions (IAIABC)
has also developed standardized data coding and reporting systems used in many states.

NIOSH Anthropometric Data and ISO Digital Headforms
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
In 2003, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a nationwide anthropometric survey of 3,997 subjects. The resulting head and face measurements were used to develop an anthropometric database detailing the face size distributions of respirator users using both traditional measurement methods and three-dimensional (3D) scanning systems. This database was used to establish fit test panels to be incorporated into NIOSH respirator certification and international standards. One of the panels developed, called the principal component analysis (PCA) panel, uses the first two principal components obtained from a set of 10 facial dimensions (age and race adjusted) and divides user population into five face-size categories. These 10 dimensions are associated with respirator fit and leakage and can predict the remaining face dimensions as well. Respirators designed to fit these panels are expected to accommodate more than 95% of the current U.S. civilian workers. From the 3,997 subje

Firefighter Body Dimensions for Updating Safety Specifications for Fire Apparatus and Firefighter Protective Equipment
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Up-to-date anthropometric information (body dimensions) of the U.S. firefighter population is needed for updating ergonomic and safety specifications for fire apparatus and firefighter protective equipment. Seventy-one measurements relevant to the design of seats, seat belts, cabs, turnout gear, gloves, and head-and-face gear are presented in this webpage. Forty of the 71 measurements were collected with the participants in fitted shorts in both standing and seated postures. Twenty-one of the 71 measurements were collected while the participants were wearing their personal turnout gear, including personal selection of tools stored in their pockets, in both standing and seated postures. Ten of the 71 measurements were hand- and head/face-related dimensions extracted from hand and head/face scans. The data obtained in this study provide the first available U.S. national firefighter anthropometric information which will benefit the design of future fire apparatus and protective equipment to better protect firefi

Inhalation of polycarbonate emissions generated during 3D printing processes affects neuroendocrine function in male rats
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Three-dimensional printing (3DP) of manufactured goods has increased in the last 10 yrs. The increased use of this technology has resulted in questions about the health effects of inhaling emissions generated during printing. The goal of this study was to determine if inhalation of particulate and toxic chemicals generated during printing with polycarbonate (PC) plastic affected the neuroendocrine system. Male rats were exposed to 3D-printer emissions (500 µg/cm3) or filtered air for 1, 4, 8, 15 or 30d for 4d/week (4h/day). The effects of these exposures on hormone concentrations, and markers of function, injury and/or oxidative stress in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus and testes were measured after 1, 8 and 30d of exposure. Thirty days of exposure to 3D-emissions resulted in reductions in thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin. These changes were accompanied by increases in markers of cell injury and reductions in active mitochondria in the olfactory bulb, gonadotropin releasing hormone cells and fibers and tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabeled fibers in the arcuate nucleus, and reductions in spermatogonium. PC plastics contain high concentrations bisphenol A and these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the health effects of inhaling 3D-printer emissions may be due to bisphenol A.

Anthropometric Database for the EMTs in the United States
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Deaths or serious injuries among emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and other ambulance occupants occur at a high rate during transport. According to a study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), EMTs and paramedics have higher fatality rates when compared to all workers, with forty-five percent of EMT deaths resulting from highway incidents, primarily due to vehicle collisions.1 Data from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration showed that among the persons killed in crashes involving an ambulance between 1992 and 2011, twenty one percent were EMTs and patients, while four percent were ambulance drivers.2 To reduce injury potential to the EMTs and other ambulance occupants, NIOSH, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. General Services Administration, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, along with private industry partners, have committed to improving the workspace design of ambulance patient compartments for safe and effective perfo

Systemic toxicity induced by topical application of perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) in a murine model
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Perfluoroheptaoinc acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) are synthetic chemicals belonging to the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) group that includes over 5,000 chemicals. PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA are short-chain PFAS (C7, C6, C5, respectively) that have been labeled as a safer alternative to the legacy PFAS perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS) which have been linked to numerous health effects. This class of chemicals are incorporated into consumer products such as stain resistant carpeting and textiles, nanosprays, medical devices, and fire-fighting foams. There is a high potential for occupational exposure and in the environment, short-chain PFAS have been detected in a variety of water sources leading to concerns for dermal exposure, however, these studies are lacking. In previous studies from our lab, PFOA was demonstrated to be absorbed via the skin and immunomodulatory. Also, the short-chain PFAS, PFBA, was found to have systemic toxic effects on mice with dermal exposure. In the present study, the systemic toxicity of a 28-day dermal PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA (1.25-5% w/v or v/v, or 31.25-125 mg/kg/dose) exposure was evaluated in a murine model.

Trends in Worker Hearing Loss by Industry Sector, 1981-2010
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Background: The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of hearing loss for noise-exposed U.S. workers by industry sector and 5-year time period, covering 30 years. Methods: Audiograms for 1.8 million workers from 1981-2010 were examined. Incidence and prevalence were estimated by industry sector and time period. The adjusted risk of incident hearing loss within each time period and industry sector as compared with a reference time period was also estimated. Results: The adjusted risk for incident hearing loss decreased over time when all industry sectors were combined. However, the risk remained high for workers in Healthcare and Social Assistance, and the prevalence was consistently high for Mining and Construction workers. Conclusions: While progress has been made in reducing the risk of incident hearing loss within most industry sectors, additional efforts are needed within Mining, Construction and Healthcare and Social Assistance.

Total Inward Leakage (TIL) for Respiratory Protective Devices
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Total inward leakage (TIL) is an estimate of the performance of a respirator, which is measured as the leakage of contaminants through the filter media and through the faceseal interface and exhalation valve of respiratory protective devices under laboratory conditions. Several test agents have been used to measure TIL in different countries. There is a lack of consensus on the most appropriate test method to measure TIL. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed a standard (ISO, 2014) on the comparison of TIL measurement using sodium chloride (NaCl) and corn oil aerosols, and sulfur hexafluoride gas. A comparison of the TIL values between different methods will enable the selection of a relatively suitable method for measuring TIL. NIOSH’s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) investigated the TIL values for respirators worn by test subjects exposed to NaCl and corn oil aerosols in two aerosol chambers side-by-side. Four air-purifying respirator categories, made

NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program Noise Measurement Database
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
This noise database was developed to provide researchers and other interested stakeholders with noise measurement results that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has collected during health hazard evaluation (HHE) surveys from 1996 through 2013. HHEs are requested by employees or their representatives, or employers, to help learn whether health hazards are present at their workplace. The scope of HHEs varies based on the requestors’ concerns and the NIOSH project officers’ professional judgment. Only noise measurement results are included in this database; however, many HHEs include evaluation of exposures other than noise. Individual HHE reports are published on the NIOSH website. When available, the database provides a direct link to the HHE report for each of the noise measurement results. The noise database contains workplace noise measurement results from 77 HHE reports, including over 808 personal noise exposure measurements and 582 area noise measurements. It also includes the following information: U.S. state or territory; Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) region; National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) sector; North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; facility description; type of dosimeter or sound level meter used; whether a hearing conservation program was in place; whether a hearing protection was used; whether octave band data was collected; job title; noise-generating activities; location of noise measurements; start and end date for site visit; type (full-shift, partial-shift, or task-based) and duration of noise measurement; type of noise (continuous, impulsive, or intermittent); exposure to ototoxic chemicals; and results in decibels A-weighted (dBA) and percent dose according to OSHA and NIOSH noise measurement criteria. This database is an ongoing project and will be updated at least yearly to add the most recent HHE noise measurement data.

NPPTL Filtering Facepiece Respirators with an Exhalation Valve: Measurements of Filtration Efficiency to Evaluate Their Potential for Source Control
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are used extensively by healthcare personnel (HCP) during a pandemic. FFRs are primarily reserved for those personnel who have a greater risk and longer duration of exposure compared with other workers and the general public. Some FFR models contain an exhalation valve, which is a device that closes to allow inhaled breath to be pulled through the filter media and opens to allow exhaled breath to be expelled from the respirator through the exhalation valve as well as the filter media. These FFR models provide the wearer with a level of protection like that of an FFR without an exhalation valve, and they are thought to increase the wearer’s comfort at high work rates and be suitable for longer periods of use. However, respiratory secretions expelled by wearers may exit along with air through the exhalation valve. A concern with FFRs with an exhalation valve is that individuals may spread disease if unfiltered, virus-laden aerosols pass through the valve. During the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not recommend using an FFR with an exhalation valve for source control (i.e., to filter respiratory secretions to prevent disease transmission to others) and advised that if only this option isavailable and source control was needed, then the valve should be covered with a surgical mask, procedure mask, or a cloth face covering that does not interfere with the respirator fit. The CDC requested research to provide improved science-based recommendations on the use of exhalation valves. This study had three aims: (1) to measure the filtration efficiency provided by FFRs with an exhalation valve under conditions of inward airflow (i.e., in the direction of inhalation) and outward airflow (i.e., in the direction of exhalation); (2) to evaluate how particle penetration in FFRs with an exhalation valve compares to particle penetration in surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts; and (3) to determine the filtration efficiency of three modifications to the exhalation valve in FFRs with the goal of mitigating the emission of unfiltered particles. To accomplish these three aims, thirteen FFR models were each tested in two positions: inward position, which is used by the NIOSH Respirator Approval Program when testing N-type respirators, and outward position, which was used experimentally to channel airflow in the direction of exhalation. For the inward position, three mitigation strategies were used: (1)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with commonly available surgical tape, (2)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with an electrocardiogram (ECG) pad; and (3)stretching a surgical mask over the exterior of the FFR. The purpose of these three strategies was to measure the varying filtration efficiencies to determine their contribution toward source control. Both positions and all mitigation strategies were tested at three airflow rates: 25, 55, and 85 lpm (liters per minute). In addition to the FFR evaluations, researchers evaluated a selection of surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts using the outward position and flowrates described previously.

Respirator Performance against Nanoparticles under Simulated Workplace Activities Data
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHRs) are commonly used by workers for protection against potentially hazardous particles, including engineered nanoparticles (i.e., particles measuring less than 100 nanometers (nm). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of these types of respirators against 10-400 nm particles using human subjects exposed to NaCl aerosols under simulated workplace activities. Simulated workplace protection factors (SWPFs) were measured for eight combinations of respirator models (2 N95 FFRs, 2 P100 FFRs, 2 N95 EHRs, and 2 P100 EHRs) worn by 25 healthy test subjects (13 females and 12 males) with varying face sizes. Before beginning a SWPF test for a given respirator model, each subject had to pass a quantitative fit test. Each SWPF test was performed using a protocol of six exercises for three minutes each: (i) normal breathing, (ii) deep breathing, (iii) moving head side to side, (iv) moving head up and down, (v) bending at th

An Investigation Into the Relationship Between Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis and Dust Exposure in U.S. Coal Miners
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
The National Study of Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis (NSCWP) is a large, continuing epidemiologic study of the respiratory health of U.S. coal miners. By using information from the study, prevalence of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) was related to indexes of dust exposure obtained from research and compliance sampling data. Clear relationships between prevalences of both simple CWP and progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and estimated dust exposure were seen. Additional effects independently associated with coal rank (% carbon) and age were also seen. Logistic model fitting indicated that between 2% and 12% of miners exposed to a 2-mg/m3 dust environment in bituminous coal mines would be expected to have Category 2 or greater CWP after a 40-yr working life; PMF would be expected for between 1.3% and 6.7%. The risks for anthracite miners appeared to be greater. There was a suggestion of a background level of abnormality, not associated with dust exposure, but increasing with age. Although there are certain we

Evaluation of Propylene Glycol Methyl Ether as a Potential Challenge Agent for Leak Detection of Liquid and Headspace from Closed System Drug Transfer Devices using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Measurement of vapors from solutions containing propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) released inside a closed chamber were evaluated. Data used to quantify limits of detection, limits of quantification, bias, precision, and accuracy of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of vapors from 2.5 M PGME solutions are presented. The effects of ethanol as a component of the PGME solution were also evaluated. Liquid drops of PGME solutions and headspace vapors above PGME solutions were released to simulate leaks from Closed System Drug-Transfer Devices (CSTD)s. Using a calibration apparatus, an instrumental LOD of 0.25 ppmv and a LOQ of 0.8 ppmv were determined for PGME vapor. A LOD of 1.1 µL and a LOQ of 3.5 µL was determined for liquid aliquots of 2.5 M PGME solution released in the NIOSH chamber. Accurate quantitation of liquid leaks required complete evaporation of droplets. With the upper end of the usable quantitation range limited by slow evaporation of relatively large droplets and the lower end defined by the method LOQ, the method has a narrow quantitative range for liquid droplets. Displacement of 45 mL of vial headspace containing PGME vapor is the largest amount expected when using the draft NIOSH testing protocol. Release of an unfiltered 45 mL headspace aliquot within the NIOSH chamber was calculated to produce a concentration of 0.8 ppmv based on the Henry’s constant, which is right at the instrumental LOQ. Therefore, the sensitivity of the method was not adequate to determine leaks of PGME vapor from a headspace release through an air filtering CSTD when using the draft NIOSH testing protocols with an FTIR analyzer.

Effects of Crystalline Silica Inhalation in a High-Fat Western Diet
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Adipose tissue (AT), an endocrine organ, plays a central role in maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis through its release of adipokines. Obesity, affecting over 40% of American adults, disrupts adipocyte metabolism leading to chronic systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction (MetDys). MetDys is associated with impaired lung function, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of silica inhalation in a pre-existing MetDys animal model to determine if an occupational exposure of silica dust has the potential to initiate or further the progression of MetDys associated conditions.

A model for detecting the effects of vibration on peripheral blood flow
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Exposure to hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) has been shown to result in cold-induced vasoconstriction and a reduction in blood flow to the hands and fingers of workers. Occupational exposure to HTV can also induce a hypersensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system to various stimuli, which in turn can result in vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels and blanching of the skin because of reductions in peripheral blood flow. The data presented were collected using an established animal model of vibration-induced white finger (Welcome et al. 2008) to determine if changes in blood flow induced by vibration exposure could be used as a biomarker for the development of vibration-induced peripheral vascular disease. Two separate experiments were done. In Experiment 1, changes in blood flow were measured in the ventral tail artery of the rat tail before and after a 4 h exposure to tail vibration (frequency 125 Hz, amplitude 5 g). These data were compared with those of animals that were restrained and had t

Anthropometry of Law Enforcement Officers
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
The accommodation of worker anthropometric variability in the workplace and personal protective equipment (PPE) is key to safe and efficient completion of work tasks. Previously, the best data available was 46 years old, which has largely become outdated due to demographic changes. These data tables consist of 34 traditional semi-nude body dimensions without gear (e.g., chest depth, standing; foot breadth, horizontal, standing; hip circumference; stature; elbow rest height, sitting; and eye height, sitting) and 15 dimension measurements over clothing and with gear (e.g., abdominal extension depth, sitting; hip breadth, sitting; and should-grip length, sitting) of 756 male and 218 female Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs). For many LEOs, patrol vehicles are the workplace where they spend significant portions of their workday and PPE is vital gear to safeguard LEOs from the harm of assaults. Design improvements of vehicle console space, vehicle ingress/egress, and LEO body-worn equipment can result in reduced LEO fatigue, pain, or injury.

Prevalence of Hearing Loss in the United States by Industry, 2000-2008
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Background: Twenty-two million workers are exposed to hazardous noise in the United States. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss among U.S. industries. Methods: We examined 2000–2008 audiograms for male and female workers ages 18–65, who had higher occupational noise exposures than the general population. Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for hearing loss were estimated and compared across industries. Results: In our sample, 18% of workers had hearing loss. When compared with the Couriers and Messengers industry sub-sector, workers employed in Mining (PR = 1.65, CI = 1.57–1.73), Wood Product Manufacturing (PR = 1.65, CL = 1.61– 1.70), Construction of Buildings (PR = 1.59, CI = 1.51–1.68), and Real Estate and Rental and Leasing (PR = 1.61, CL = 1.51–1.71) had higher risks for hearing loss. Conclusions: Workers in the Mining, Manufacturing, and Construction industries need better engineering controls for noise and stronger hearing conservation strategies. More hearing loss research is also needed within traditional ‘‘low-risk’’ industries like Real Estate.

Efficacy of universal masking for source control and personal protection from simulated respiratory aerosols in a room
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Masks block aerosols produced during coughs and exhalations (“source control”). Masks also slow and deflect cough and exhalation airflows, which changes the dispersion of aerosols. Factors such as the directions in which people are facing (orientation) and separation distance also affect aerosol dispersion. However, it is not clear how masking, orientation, and distance interact. We placed a respiratory aerosol simulator (“source”) and a breathing simulator (“recipient”) in a chamber and measured aerosol concentrations for different combinations of masking, orientation, and separation distance. When the simulators were front-to-front during coughing, masks reduced the 15-minute mean aerosol concentration at the recipient by 92% (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 and 1.8 m separation. When the simulators were side-by-side, masks reduced the concentration by 81% at 0.9 m and 78% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). During breathing, masks reduced the aerosol concentration by 66% when front-to-front (p = 0.0056) and 76% when side-by-side (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 m. Similar results were seen at 1.8 m. When the simulators were unmasked, changing the orientations from front-to-front to side-by-side reduced the cough aerosol concentration by 59% at 0.9 m and 60% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). When both simulators were masked, changing the orientations did not significantly change the concentration at either distance during coughing or breathing. Increasing the distance between the simulators from 0.9 m to 1.8 m during coughing reduced the aerosol concentration by 25% when no masks were worn (p < 0.0001) but had little effect when both simulators were masked (4% decrease, p = 0.7090). During breathing, when neither simulator was masked, increasing the separation reduced the concentration by 13%, which approached significance (p = 0.0737), while the change was not significant when both source and recipient were masked (8% decrease, p = 0.3235). Our results suggest that universal masking reduces exposure to respiratory aerosol particles regardless of the orientation and separation distance between the source and recipient.

The effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on cardiovascular function
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Air pollution serves as a major risk factor for the development of asthma, respiratory disease and heart disease. Diesel particulate and fumes are a major contributor to air pollution. Workers in a number of different occupations, including mining, oil and gas exploration and refining, and drivers of heavy equipment who are regularly exposed to diesel exhaust while on the job, and persons living in areas with high levels of air pollution, are at an increased risk for developing asthma, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Understanding the physiological and cellular effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on Various organs in the body is critical for identifying exposure-induced biological and physiological markers of disease or dysfunction. The experiments in this manuscript, focus on the effects of diesel exhaust (DE) inhalation on peripheral and cardiovascular function. In the current studies, we hypothesized that the development of cardiovascular disease in workers regularly exposed to DE is the result of the inhalation of volatile gases and particulate within the vapor that affect the cardiovascular system by altering physiological and cellular processes that affect peripheral vascular responsiveness to agents that cause blood vessels to constrict and vessels that cause blood vessels to dilate, blood pressure, cardiac output and kidney function (kidney function as it may contribute to changes in blood pressure). We also predicted that these changes in physiology would be associated with changes in the expression of proteins and the production of genes that play a role in regulating oxidative stress, responses to decreases in oxygen, and markers of kidney function that are associated with blood pressure.

Efficacy of Portable Air Cleaners and Masking for Reducing Indoor Exposure to Simulated Exhaled SARS-CoV-2 Aerosols — United States, 2021
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
SARS-CoV-2 can be spread by droplets and aerosols expelled by infected people when they cough, talk, sing, or exhale. To reduce exposure to these droplets and aerosols while indoors, CDC recommends measures including physical distancing, universal mask wearing, and room ventilation. Ventilation systems can be supplemented with portable air cleaners to remove infectious material from the air more quickly and provide greater protection. We conducted a case study using respiratory simulators to examine the efficacy of portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaners and universal masking at reducing exposure to simulated exhaled aerosol particles from an infected meeting participant in a conference room. We found that, in a room with good air mixing, the use of two HEPA air cleaners meeting the EPA recommended Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) reduced the overall exposure by up to 65%, and that the combination of the HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced exposure by up to 90%. The air cleaners were most effective when they were close to the aerosol source. Our results demonstrate that portable HEPA cleaners can be an effective method to reduce exposure to airborne particles while meeting indoors, especially in combination with universal masking.
