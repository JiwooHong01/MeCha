Cervical Cancer
Screening for Cervical Cancer
KEY POINTS
The HPV test and the Pap test can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early.
You should start getting Pap tests at age 21. If you are 30 years old or older, talk to your doctor about testing options.
Screening tests
The HPV test and the Pap test can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early.
The HPV test looks for the virus (human papillomavirus) that can cause cell changes on the cervix.
The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for precancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately.
Both tests can be done in a doctor's office or clinic. During the Pap test, the doctor will use a plastic or metal instrument, called a speculum, to look inside your vagina. This helps the doctor examine the vagina and the cervix, and collect a few cells and mucus from the cervix and the area around it. The cells are sent to a laboratory.
If you are getting a Pap test, the cells will be checked to see if they look normal.
If you are getting an HPV test, the cells will be tested for HPV.
What is cervical precancer? When there are cervical cells that look abnormal but are not yet cancerous, it is called cervical precancer. These abnormal cells may be the first sign of cancer that develops years later. Cervical precancer usually doesn't cause pain or other symptoms. It is found with a Pap test.
Cindy's Story: Preventing Cervical Cancer
Audio Description Low Resolution Video
""If I didn't go to that appointment, I might not be around for my kids,"" says Cindy. Her cervical cancer screening test found precancerous cells. She shares her story in this video.
When to get screened
If you are 21 to 29 years old
You should start getting Pap tests at age 21. If your Pap test result is normal, your doctor may tell you that you can wait three years until your next Pap test.
If you are 30 to 65 years old
Talk to your doctor about which testing option is right for you:
An HPV test only. This is called primary HPV testing. If your result is normal, your doctor may tell you that you can wait five years until your next screening test.
An HPV test along with a Pap test. This is called co-testing. If both of your results are normal, your doctor may tell you that you can wait five years until your next screening test.
A Pap test only. If your result is normal, your doctor may tell you that you can wait three years until your next Pap test.
If you are older than 65
Your doctor may tell you that you don't need to be screened anymore if:
You have had at least three Pap tests or two HPV tests in the past 10 years, and the test results were normal or negative, and
You have not had a cervical precancer in the past, or
You have had your cervix removed as part of a total hysterectomy for non-cancerous conditions, like fibroids.
Are you worried about the cost?
CDC offers free or low-cost cervical cancer screening tests through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.
Find out if you qualify.
How to prepare for your test
No special preparation is needed before you have an HPV test.
If you are getting a Pap test, you can take steps to make sure the test results are accurate. Avoid intercourse, douching, and using vaginal medicines or spermicidal foam for 2 days before the test. If you had sex before the test, go to the appointment as planned and let the doctor know.
If you have your period, don't worry. Both tests can still be done at this time.
Test results
It can take as long as three weeks to receive your test results. If your test shows that something might not be normal, your doctor will contact you and figure out how best to follow up. There are many reasons why test results might not be normal. It usually does not mean you have cancer.
If your test results show cells that are not normal and may become cancer, your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated. In most cases, treatment prevents cervical cancer from developing. It is important to follow up with your doctor right away to learn more about your test results and receive any treatment that may be needed.
If your test results are normal, your chance of getting cervical cancer in the next few years is very low. Your doctor may tell you that you can wait several years for your next cervical cancer screening test. But you should still go to the doctor regularly for a checkup.
Pap test result
A Pap test result can be normal, unclear, abnormal, or unsatisfactory.
A normal (or ""negative"") result means that no cell changes were found on your cervix. This is good news. But you still need to get Pap tests in the future. New cell changes can still form on your cervix. Your doctor may tell you that you can wait three years for your next screening test if you received a Pap test only. If you also received an HPV test, and the result is negative, your doctor may tell you that you can wait five years for your next screening test.
It is common for test results to come back unclear. Your doctor may use other words to describe this result, like equivocal, inconclusive, or ASC-US. These all mean the same thing—that your cervical cells look like they could be abnormal. It is not clear if it's related to HPV. It could be related to life changes like pregnancy, menopause, or an infection. The HPV test can help find out if your cell changes are related to HPV. Ask your doctor what to do next.
An abnormal result means that cell changes were found on your cervix. This usually does not mean that you have cervical cancer. Abnormal changes on your cervix are likely caused by HPV. The changes may be minor (low-grade) or serious (high-grade). Most of the time, minor changes go back to normal on their own. But more serious changes can turn into cancer if they are not removed. The more serious changes are often called ""precancer"" because they are not yet cancer, but they can turn into cancer over time. In rare cases, an abnormal Pap test can show that you may have cancer. You will need other tests to be sure. The earlier you find cervical cancer, the easier it is to treat.
If there are not enough cells in the sample or the cells are clumped together, this is considered unsatisfactory. Your doctor may ask you to come back for another Pap test in a few months.
HPV test result
An HPV test result can be positive or negative.
A negative HPV test means you do not have an HPV type that is linked to cervical cancer. Your doctor may tell you that you can wait five years for your next screening test.
A positive HPV test means you do have an HPV type that may be linked to cervical cancer. This does not mean you have cervical cancer now. But it could be a warning. The specific HPV type may be identified to determine the next step.

Public Information Collection Activities
KEY POINTS
Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires all federal agencies to obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget before collecting information from the public.
Read about the PRA and the enforcement of the act at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Overview
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires that any data collection conducted or sponsored by the federal government complies with its regulations. All Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) programs that engage with the general public to collect information must submit PRA requests to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in order to proceed with data collection activities. The Information Collection Review Office (ICRO) of the CDC facilitates the process of reviewing and submitting PRA requests to the OMB on behalf of all CDC programs.
CDC Paperwork Reduction Act Compliance
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) is a law that requires federal agencies to:
Seek public comment on proposed information collections.
Obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before collecting information from the public.
The PRA grants authority to OMB to review and approve federally conducted and sponsored data collections involving ten or more respondents. The law and its implementing regulation (5 CFR 1320
) reduce the burden placed upon non-Federal entities (the public). The PRA prevents Federal agencies and their programs from collecting unnecessary information.
Goals of the PRA are to:
Minimize the burden on the public when collecting information, especially by using technology.
Maximize the practical use of the information collected.
Ensure that an Information Collection does not duplicate already existing information.
Maximize the cooperation amongst federal program areas and agencies.
Promote openness and accountability in the collection and use of information.
Improve integrity, quality, security, and utility of information to all users within and outside the federal government.
Improve federal responsibility and accountability.
To access federal agencies' and their internal program offices' active and inactive information collection clearance packages, go to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
. This is a United States government website produced by the OMB and the General Services Administration.
Meningitis
About Parasitic Meningitis
KEY POINTS
Parasites can cause meningitis or affect the brain or nervous system in other ways.
Meningitis from parasites is less common than viral and bacterial meningitis.
Some people may have increased risk of infection because of where they live or travel.
Diagnosis can be hard and there aren't any specific treatments.
What it is
Meningitis caused by parasites is called EM which is short for either:
Eosinophilic meningitis
Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis
Types
The 3 main parasites that cause EM in some infected people are:
Angiostrongylus cantonensis (neurologic angiostrongyliasis)
Baylisascaris procyonis (baylisascariasis; neural larva migrans)
Gnathostoma spinigerum (neurognathostomiasis)
Symptoms
People with EM who have symptoms can have typical meningitis symptoms. They also may have an eye infection.
People with EM caused by A. cantonensis often have tingling or painful feelings in their skin.
When to seek emergency care
Anyone with symptoms of meningitis should see a healthcare provider right away. A healthcare provider can determine if you have meningitis, what's causing it, and the best treatment.
Complications
These parasites can cause severe complications, such as
Loss of coordination and muscle control
Weakness/paralysis
Coma
Permanent disability
Death
Risk factors
Risk factors vary by parasite, but can include age, animal contact, and geographic location.
A. cantonensis
Most of these infections are diagnosed in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, including in Hawaii.
B. procyonis
This parasite infects raccoons throughout the United States, mainly in the Midwest, Northeast, Middle Atlantic, and West Coast.
People in these areas who spend time around raccoons are at increased risk. Young children are also at risk due to increased likelihood of putting contaminated fingers, soil, or objects in their mouths.
G. spinigerum
This infection is most commonly diagnosed in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand, and Japan.
How it spreads
These parasites normally infect animals not people. People get infected primarily by eating infected animals or contaminated foods, or being exposed to infected animals.
Typical source of infection
A. cantonensis: Raw or undercooked snails or slugs, contaminated produce
B. procyonis: Environments (such as dirt) contaminated with raccoon feces
G. spinigerum: Raw or undercooked freshwater fish or eels, frogs, poultry, snakes
How it doesn't spread
Generally, people don't spread parasitic meningitis or the parasites that cause it to other people.
Reducing risk
Visit CDC's website for each parasite to learn specifics on how to prevent infection with these and other parasites. Generally, you can reduce your risk in the following ways:
A. cantonensis: Don’t eat undercooked or raw foods that might be infected
B. procyonis: Avoid contact with raccoons and their feces
G. spinigerum: Don’t eat undercooked or raw foods that might be infected
Testing and diagnosis
In addition to laboratory tests for meningitis, healthcare providers look for evidence of parasitic infection. It's often hard to find these parasites.
The following may be helpful for making a diagnosis:
Travel or exposure history
Clinical examination
Other medical tests, such as brain scans
Treatment and recovery
There's no specific treatment for EM caused by these parasites. However, treatment for the infection might help some people.
Pain medication may be used for headaches.
Medications may also be used to reduce the body’s reaction to the parasite.
Typhoid Fever and Paratyphoid Fever


About Typhoid Fever and Paratyphoid Fever
KEY POINTS
Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are life-threatening illnesses.
Each of the illnesses is caused by a kind of Salmonella bacteria (germs).
Most people in the United States with these illnesses were infected during international travel.
You can find out if you need a typhoid fever vaccine at www.cdc.gov/travel.
Overview
Symptoms
Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever have similar symptoms, including fever. The illnesses are life-threatening and people with symptoms should get medical help immediately.
Germs responsible
The illnesses are caused by Salmonella bacteria.
Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella serotype Typhi.
Paratyphoid fever is caused by Salmonella serotype Paratyphi.
Illness estimates
Every year, millions of people around the world get sick from these diseases.
Typhoid fever
9.2 million illnesses are estimated to occur worldwide each year
5,700 illnesses and 620 hospitalizations are estimated to occur in the United States each year. Most people are infected while traveling internationally.
Paratyphoid fever
3.8 million illnesses are estimated to occur worldwide each year
CDC does not have estimates of illnesses and hospitalizations in the United States
Where illness is common
These illnesses are most common in parts of the world where water and food can be unsafe, and sanitation can be poor, including parts of:
Asia (especially Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh)
Africa
Latin America
Most people in the United States with typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever were infected while traveling to these places.
Risk factors
The chances of getting typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever in the United States are very low.
The chances increase for people in the United States who:
Travel to countries in Africa, Asia, or Latin America where the diseases are common
Visit rural areas of those countries
Visit family and friends in those countries
Are not vaccinated against typhoid fever
Almost all people in the United States with these diseases report that they have traveled internationally. Most report that they traveled to countries in South Asia, including Pakistan, India, or Bangladesh.
How it spreads
The bacteria spread to and among people in several ways
The bacteria that cause these illnesses are shed (gotten rid of) in poop. People who shed the bacteria include:
People who have symptoms of typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever
People who are no longer sick but still have the bacteria in their body
You can get typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever after swallowing the bacteria. The bacteria can get in your mouth in several ways, including:
Through food, drinks, and water that have been contaminated by sewage
Through food that has been rinsed in contaminated water and then eaten
Through food that has been touched by a person who did not wash their hands after using the bathroom or changing a diaper
You can take steps to keep safe from these diseases

The Air Quality Index (AQI)
Sometimes the air quality outdoors may not be safe for everyone. What can you do?
Pay attention to the Air Quality Index (AQI)
. The AQI tells you when high levels of air pollution are predicted and how air pollution affects your health.
Finding the AQI is easy. It's on the Web, on many local TV weather forecasts, or you can sign up for free e-mail tools or download the AirNow app
.
Download
Air Quality Index scale
The AQI is easy to use. If the AQI predicts a ""Code Orange"" (unhealthy for sensitive groups) day don't cancel your plans—use the AQI to help you plan a better time or place for them.
The AQI tells you about major air pollutants in the U.S. that are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, including ozone and particle pollution. Ozone and particle pollution may harm the health of hundreds of thousands of Americans each year.
Ozone and particle pollution
Let's say that the ozone level where you live is predicted to be Code Orange tomorrow. If you're a runner—even if you're healthy—that air quality could hurt you. Using the AQI, you can plan your run for when ozone levels will be lower, shorten your run or walk instead, or run on a treadmill indoors.
Particle pollution has been linked to heart attacks and strokes, and even death in people with heart disease. On a day when particle pollution will be at Code Orange, do something less intense. Walk instead of run or do only lighter outdoor work.
Use the AQI Wherever You Go
Don't forget to check the AQI when you're on vacation or travelling within the U.S. No matter where you go, you can always access the AQI.

Parvovirus B19 and Fifth Disease
About Parvovirus B19
AT A GLANCE
Parvovirus B19 infection is usually mild in people who are otherwise healthy.
Common symptoms include ""slapped cheek"" rash in children, and joint pains in adults.
Complications can occur among people with underlying blood disorders or weakened immune system.
Infection early during pregnancy can cause a slight increase in the risk of a miscarriage.
Overview
Parvovirus B19 infection usually causes no symptoms or mild illness, such as flu-like symptoms, rashes and joint pains. In individuals with blood disorders or a weakened immune system, infection can cause a low blood count. Infection during pregnancy can sometimes lead to additional complications.
Symptoms
Some people who get infected with this virus will have no symptoms.
When symptoms of parvovirus B19 infection occur, they are usually mild and may include the following:
Fever
Headache
Cough
Sore throat
Rashes
Joint pain
Rashes
The clinical presentation most often associated with parvovirus B19 infection is a red rash on the face, also called a ""slapped cheek"" rash. This is also known as Fifth Disease (or Erythema Infectiosum). This rash typically appears a few days after the fever or flu-like symptoms. It is more common in children than adults.
Parvovirus B19 infection can also cause a general rash on the chest, back, buttocks, or arms and legs. The rash may be itchy. It usually goes away in 7 to 10 days but can come and go for several weeks. As it starts to go away, it may look lacy.
Joint Pain
Infection with parvovirus B19 can lead to pain and swelling in the joints, called polyarthopathy syndrome. This is more common in adults than children and is most common in women.
Adults may experience joint pain without other symptoms. Joints are affected on both sides, usually in the hands, feet and knees. The joint pain usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks but can last for months or longer. It usually goes away without any long-term problems.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Parvovirus B19
Complications
Parvovirus B19 infection is usually mild for children and adults who are otherwise healthy. However, for some people, it can cause serious health complications affecting the nerves, joints, or blood system.
Parvovirus B19 has been shown to cause a severe drop in blood count (anemia) in some patients with certain blood disorders or with a weakened immune system.
You may be at increased risk for complications from a parvovirus B19 infection if you have one or more of these health conditions:
Leukemia or other cancers
Organ transplant
HIV infection
Blood disorders such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia
Parvovirus B19 in pregnancy
If you get a parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy, the virus could spread to the baby. This is not common but could cause a miscarriage. See 'Parvovirus B19 in Pregnancy' for further information.
Keep Reading:
Parvovirus B19 in Pregnancy
Recent data on parvovirus B19 activity in the U.S.
Parvovirus B19 has become more prevalent this year with an increased number of cases in 2024, compared to previous years. Recent MMWR articles demonstrate how certain groups at increased risk from infection have been affected by severe health outcomes.
Notes from the Field: Human Parvovirus B19 Infections Among Pregnant Persons — Minnesota, January–September 2024
Diagnosis
In special circumstances, your healthcare provider may test your blood for parvovirus antibodies. The test will determine if you are susceptible or possibly immune to parvovirus B19 infection or if you were recently infected.
Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about whether you should get tested.
Treatment
Parvovirus B19 infections are usually mild and will go away on their own. Children and adults who are otherwise healthy usually recover completely.
Treatment usually involves relieving symptoms, such as fever, itching, and joint pain and swelling. For persons who develop a low blood count, treatment may include supportive care, blood products, and other specialized therapies.
See your healthcare provider if:
You have complications from a parvovirus B19 infection, or
You are infected while pregnant.
Patient Safety
Tips for Being a Safe Patient
KEY POINTS
Being a safe patient reduces your risk for illnesses while you receive care in places like a hospital.
Patients, caregivers and healthcare providers all play a role in patient safety.
Why it's important
Did you know you can get infections in healthcare settings while being treated for something else?
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) can spread from person to person, through hands, medical equipment and more. HAIs are becoming more resistant to antibiotics and antifungals, making them difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat.
Patients and their loved ones can help prevent HAIs, including those caused by antimicrobial-resistant germs. These tips describe how to be a safe patient and help reduce your risk of infections.
What you can do to be a safe patient
1. Tell your healthcare provider about any recent care.

2. Tell your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection or if your infection is getting worse.

3. Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed and tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effects, such as diarrhea.

4. Remind staff and visitors to keep their hands clean.

5. Allow people to clean your room.
Tips for patient safety
Tell healthcare providers about any recent care
Be sure to tell your provider if you:
Were hospitalized in another facility.
Received healthcare outside of the United States in the last six months.
Ever had an antimicrobial-resistant infection.
Communicate with healthcare providers
Speak up
. Talk to your healthcare provider about any questions or worries. Ask what they're doing to protect you.
Tell your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection, if an infection is not getting better, or if it’s getting worse. Ask, “could this be sepsis?”
If you have a urinary or central line catheter, ask daily when they can be removed. Leaving a catheter in place too long increases the chances you’ll get an infection.
Know the signs and symptoms of infection. Some skin infections appear as redness, pain or drainage at the IV catheter site or surgery site. Skin infections usually come with a fever, too.
Insist that your healthcare providers never reuse a needle or syringe on more than one patient.
Tell your healthcare provider if you have three or more diarrhea episodes in 24 hours, especially if you’ve been taking an antibiotic.
Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed
Only take antibiotics when your provider thinks you need them.
If prescribed antibiotics, ask if they're necessary.
Follow all instructions you're given for taking them.
Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effects, such as diarrhea.

Antibiotic Prescribing and Use
Remind everyone to clean their hands
Cleaning hands often prevents the spread of germs, including resistant germs.
People should clean their hands every time they enter your room, before and after they touch equipment, you, or your wound(s), and more. This includes your healthcare providers and visitors such as family and friends.
Ask questions like, ""Before you start the exam, would you mind cleaning your hands again?"" and, ""Can you clean your hands before changing my bandages?""
Keep Reading:
About Hand Hygiene for Healthcare Settings
Allow people to clean your room
Having a clean room while you're in the hospital or other healthcare setting is important. Don't say, ""come back later."" Even if it's an inconvenient time, let staff clean your room.
Know when and why healthcare staff wear gowns and gloves
Healthcare workers may wear gowns and gloves to prevent spreading germs with their hands and clothes.
Staff should tie their gown at the neck and back, so it covers their front and shoulders.
Be mindful of antimicrobial-resistant germs
Identifying and treating resistant germs early helps prevent their spread.
You can carry a resistant germ even if you don't have symptoms.
Allow healthcare personnel to test you for an antimicrobial-resistant germ if they ask. Testing helps personnel pick the right antibiotic or antifungal treatment.
Ask your provider what they and the facility will do to protect you and your family from an antimicrobial-resistant infection.
Keep Reading:
About Antimicrobial Resistance
Stay safe before and after surgery
Take steps, such as telling your healthcare provider about other medical problems you may have and not shaving near where you will have surgery, to avoid things like surgical site infections (SSIs).
What CDC is doing
The Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) protects patients and healthcare personnel, and promotes safety, quality and value in national and international healthcare delivery systems. DHQP also tracks HAIs and antimicrobial resistance through its Emerging Infections Program, National Healthcare Safety Network, the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network and the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory and Response Network. DHQP works closely with health departments and healthcare partners to prevent HAIs and stop the spread of resistant germs.

Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Motorcycle Safety
Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Motorcycle Safety
KEY POINTS
Thousands of pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists die on our nation's roads every year.
These crash injuries and deaths are preventable.
Wearing a helmet while riding on a bicycle, e-bicycle, or motorcycle can save lives.
Pedestrian Safety
Safe roadway environments can help keep prevent pedestrian injury.
Over 8,000 pedestrians were killed on our nation's roads in crashes involving a motor vehicle in 2022.1
Local and state public health partners, other transportation-related agencies, and communities can work together to keep pedestrians safe in multiple ways, including considering evidence-based strategies that promote driving at safe speeds.23
You can take steps to keep yourself safe as a pedestrian, like by wearing reflective clothing and crossing streets at a designated crosswalk or intersection whenever possible.
Keep reading: Pedestrian Safety
Bicycle Safety
Stay safe while riding a bicycle.
Nearly 1,000 bicyclists die and about 120,000 are injured in crashes that occur on roads in the United States every year.1
All bicyclists, regardless of age, can help protect themselves by wearing properly fitted bicycle helmets every time they ride.
Effective interventions to reduce injuries and fatalities to bicyclists include bicycle helmet laws and changes to the environment (e.g., protected bike lanes).2

Lice
PARASITES 
About Head Lice
KEY POINTS
Head lice are parasitic insects that usually live on your scalp.
Symptoms include itching, tickling, or sores on your scalp.
Both prescription and over-the-counter medications treat head lice infestations.
Overview
Head lice, or Pediculus humanus capitis, are parasitic insects that feed on human blood. You can find them mostly on your head, but also on your eyebrows and eyelashes. Adult head lice are roughly 2 – 3 mm long (about the size of a sesame seed).
Both over-the-counter and prescription medications are available to treat head lice in your hair (infestation).
Symptoms
People with head lice may not have symptoms, particularly with a first infestation or when an infestation is light. Itching (pruritus) is the most common symptom of head lice infestation. It is caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites. It may take four to six weeks for itching to appear the first time a person has head lice.
Other symptoms may include the following:
A tickling feeling or a sensation of something moving in the hair
Irritability and sleeplessness
Sores on the head caused by scratching, which can sometimes become infected with bacteria normally found on your skin
Head lice do not transmit any disease and therefore are not considered a health hazard.
Who is at risk?
In the United States, infestation with head lice is most common among preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and caretakers.
There is not reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the United States; however, an estimated 6 – 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 – 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head lice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact.
In the United States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African American persons than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the United States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of some types of hair, but not others.
How it spreads
Head lice mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of a person infested with lice. Head lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or fly. Adult lice can live on a person's head for about 30 days. However, they will die within two days if they fall off a person and cannot feed. Adult female head lice are usually larger than males and can lay about six eggs each day. Nits (lice eggs) cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as those found close to the scalp. Nits take about a week (range 6 – 9 days) to hatch into nymphs (young lice). Nymphs look similar to adult lice but are very small (size of a pinhead); they take about seven days to mature into adult lice.
The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. This contact can be common among children playing at places like school or the home. Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of you or your environment.
Although not as common, head lice may spread by:
Wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person
Using infested combs, brushes, or towels
Lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with an infested person
Contracting lice from a wig or hairpiece is extremely unlikely. Especially if the wig or hairpiece hasn't been worn in the past 48 hours by a person with head lice.
Head lice can survive under water for several hours but are unlikely to spread in a swimming pool. Chlorine levels in pool water do not kill head lice.
Animals do not get or spread head lice.
Prevention
Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of head lice:
Avoid head-to-head (hair-to-hair) contact during play and other activities at home, school, and elsewhere (sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camp).
Do not share clothing such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, hair ribbons, or barrettes.
Do not share combs, brushes, or towels. Disinfest combs and brushes used by an infested person by soaking them in hot water (at least 130°F) for 5 – 10 minutes.
Do not lie on beds, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals that have recently been in contact with a person infested with head lice.
Machine wash and dry clothing, towels, bed linens, and other items that a person infested with lice wore or used during the two days before treatment. Use the hot water (130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. If you can't wash or dry clean items, seal them in a plastic bag and store them for two weeks.
Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where the infested person sat or lay. However, spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing.
Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control head lice and can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
To help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, or camp, teach children to avoid activities that may spread head lice. For example, teach children to
Avoid hair-to-hair contact during play.
Not to share clothing such as hats, hair ribbons, barrettes, scarves, coats, or sports uniforms.
Not to share combs, brushes, or towels.
Reminder
CDC's guidance has not changed—you do not need to send students with head lice infestation home early from school. They can go home at the end of the day, be treated, and return to class after beginning appropriate treatment. Nits may stay in hair after treatment, but successful treatment will kill crawling lice.
Diagnosis
Misdiagnosis of head lice infestation is common. Finding a live nymph (baby louse) or adult louse on the scalp or hair is the best way to diagnose a head lice infestation.
Because adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be difficult to find. A fine-toothed louse comb may help you find lice.
If you do not see crawling lice, look for nits attached firmly within ¼ inch of the base of hair shafts. You will often see nits on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than ¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always hatched or dead.
Although head lice and nits can be visible with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or nits. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles.
If you do not see nymphs or adults, and the only nits found are more than ¼ inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and does not need treatment.
How to Examine for Head Lice
If you are not sure if a person has head lice, see your healthcare provider.
Lice
PARASITES 
About Body Lice
KEY POINTS
Body lice are parasitic insects that feed on human blood.
Body lice spread by direct contact with others who have them.
Symptoms include itching, rash, and bites.
The only treatment is to improve hygiene and access to clean clothes.
Overview
Body lice are parasites, or insects, that feed on human blood. Body lice can spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. Adult body lice are small, only 2.3 – 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed).
Improved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment needed for body lice infestations; however, in some cases peduculicides are recommended. Body lice can spread disease (epidemic typhus, Bartonella quintana infection, and epidemic relapsing fever).
Symptoms
Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense itching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the skin.
When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become thickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper thighs).
Who is at risk
Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. They affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread quickly in:
People experiencing homelessness
Refugees
Survivors of war or natural disasters
How it spreads
Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with a person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice tends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean clothes.
Nits (lice eggs) take 6 – 9 days to hatch. Nits are tiny (0.8 – 0.3 mm) and hard to see; they can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a pinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per day. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse will die within 1 – 2 days off the host.
Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice.
Prevention
Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice:
Bathe regularly and change into machine-washed clothes at least once a week.
Machine wash and dry infested clothing and bedding using the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle.
Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store for two weeks.
Do not share clothing, beds, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with body lice.
You can fumigate or dust with chemical insecticides to control and prevent the spread of body lice for certain diseases (e.g., epidemic typhus).
Diagnosis
You can diagnose body lice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes you can see a body louse crawling or feeding on the skin.
Although body lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or eggs.
See a healthcare provider if you are unsure about an infestation.
Treatment and recovery
You can treat a body lice infestation by improving personal hygiene. Bathe and change into clean clothes at least once a week. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels used by the person infested with lice using hot water (at least 130°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle.
Pediculicide, a medicine that can kill lice, is sometimes used for treatment. If prescribed a pediculicide, apply it exactly as directed on the bottle or by your healthcare provider. However, a pediculicide is generally not necessary if hygiene is maintained and items are machine washed appropriately at least once a week.
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
DECEMBER 13, 2023
About Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)
KEY POINTS
Untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious condition, in women
1 in 8 women with a history of PID experience difficulties getting pregnant.
You can prevent PID if you know how to protect yourself. This fact sheet answers basic questions about PID.
What it is
What is PID?
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) an infection of a woman's reproductive organs. It is a complication often caused by some STIs, like chlamydia and gonorrhea. Other infections that are not sexually transmitted can also cause PID.
Signs and symptoms
How do I get PID?
You are more likely to get PID if you
Have an STI and do not get treated
Have more than one sex partner
Have a sex partner who has sex partners other than you
Have had PID before
Are sexually active and are age 25 or younger
Douche
Use an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control. However, the small increased risk is mostly limited to the first three weeks after the IUD is placed inside the uterus by a doctor
How can I reduce my risk of getting PID?
The only way to avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting PID:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STI test results
Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex
How it spreads
How do I know if I have PID?
There are no tests for PID. A diagnosis is usually based on a combination of your medical history, physical exam, and other test results. You may not realize you have PID because your symptoms may be mild, or you may not experience any symptoms. However, if you do have symptoms, you may notice
Pain in your lower abdomen
Fever
An unusual discharge with a bad odor from your vagina
Pain and/or bleeding when you have sex
Burning sensation when you urinate
Bleeding between periods
You should
Be examined by your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms
Promptly see a doctor if you think you or your sex partner(s) have or were exposed to an STI
Promptly see a doctor if you have any genital symptoms such as an unusual sore, a smelly discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods
Get a test for chlamydia and gonorrhea every year if you are sexually active and younger than 25 years of age
Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider if you are sexually active and ask whether you should be tested for other STIs
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of getting PID?
The only way to avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting PID:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STI test results
Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex
Testing
Can PID be cured?
Yes, if PID is diagnosed early, it can be treated. However, treatment won't undo any damage that has already happened to your reproductive system. The longer you wait to get treated, the more likely it is that you will have complications from PID. While taking antibiotics, your symptoms may go away before the infection is cured. Even if symptoms go away, you should finish taking all of your medicine. Be sure to tell your recent sex partner(s), so they can get tested and treated for STIs, too. It is also very important that you and your partner both finish your treatment before having any kind of sex so that you don't re-infect each other.
You can get PID again if you get infected with an STI again. Also, if you have had PID before, you have a higher chance of getting it again.
Treatment and recovery
What happens if I don't get treated?
If diagnosed and treated early, the complications of PID can be prevented. Some of the complications of PID are
Formation of scar tissue both outside and inside the fallopian tubes that can lead to tubal blockage
Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the womb)
Infertility (inability to get pregnant)
Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain
Talaromycosis
FUNGAL DISEASES
Talaromycosis (Penicilliosis) Basics
KEY POINTS
Talaromycosis (formerly penicilliosis), a fungal infection, spreads in Southeast Asia, southern China, and India.
Talaromycosis usually affects people with weakened immune systems.
Bumps on the skin are common. Other symptoms vary and affect different parts of the body.
Talaromycosis typically affects people with HIV differently than others who get infected.
Overview
Talaromycosis, formerly called penicillosis, is an infection caused by the fungus Talaromyces marneffei.
Talaromycosis affects people who live in or visit Southeast Asia, southern China, or northeastern India. Most people who get talaromycosis have a weakened immune system. People living with HIV are particularly at risk.
Skin bumps are a common sign of Tarlarmycosis. Other symptoms can include fever and cough. Talaromycosis usually affects people with HIV differently than other people who get infected.
Signs and symptoms
Most people who get talaromycosis already had a weakened immune system. Talarmycosis typically affects people with HIV differently than other people who get infected.
Common symptoms
Bumps on the skin are a common symptom. They are usually small and painless. The bumps usually appear on the face and neck but can also appear in other places on the body.
Other symptoms include:
Fever
General discomfort
Weight loss
Cough or shortness of breath
Swollen lymph nodes, liver, or spleen
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
The fungus can make people sick weeks to years after they come in contact with it.
Infections in people who have HIV
In people with advanced HIV disease, talaromycosis is more likely to spread to the bloodstream and other parts of the body. Skin bumps, fever and swelling of the spleen are also more common symptoms in people living with HIV. Skin bumps have a slightly different appearance and have a dent in the middle.
Infections in people who do not have HIV
Talaromycosis more commonly affects the mouth, throat, lungs, liver, and bone in people who do not have HIV. However it is still possible for infections to spread into the blood and other parts of hte body. Skin bumps are smooth without indentation in people with talaromycosis who do not have HIV.
Risk factors
Talaromycosis affects people who live in or visit Southeast Asia, southern China, or eastern India. Healthy people rarely get talaromycosis.
Most people who get talaromycosis have a medical condition that weakens their immune system, such as:
Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome
Cancer
HIV/AIDS
Organ transplant
Other autoimmune diseases
Agricultural workers and farmers, particularly those working during the rainy season, appear to be more likely to get talaromycosis.
Global burden of talaromycosis
SOURCE: Thuy Le, M.D., D.Phil., Associate Professor, Duke University School of Medicine
Causes
Scientitsts believe that people get talaromycosis after breathing in T. marneffei from the environment. Bamboo rats can also get talaromycosis but there is no evidence that it spreads from rats to people. Talaromycosis does not spread from person to person.
In Thailand, infections are more common during rainy seasons so rain might promote the growth of the fungus.
Talaromyces marneffei
Talaromyces marneffei can change from its native mold form in the environment to a parasitic yeast once in a warm-blooded host. In the environment (at 25°C), the mold form produces yellow green colonies and a characteristic soluble red pigment
Lifecyle of talaromycosis
Show Text Description
Prevention
A healthcare provider might prescribe medicine to prevent talaromycosis in high-risk individuals. This includes people with weakened immune systems and who live in places where the fungus is present. Itraconazole is the most commonly used medicine to prevent talaromycosis. However, healthcare providers also can prescribe other antifungal medicines.
Testing and diagnosis
Talaromycosis can be diagnosed by using a sample from the body part that is affected. For example:
Bone marrow
Blood
Fluid in and around the lungs
Lymph node
Skin
The sample is sent to a laboratory for a fungal culture or to be examined under the microscope. The sample can also be tested for the presence of a protein or DNA of the fungus.

Influenza (Flu)
People at Increased Risk for Flu Complications
WHAT TO KNOW
Some people are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu. If you are at higher risk, flu vaccination is especially important. When you get vaccinated, you reduce your risk of getting sick with flu and possibly being hospitalized or dying from flu. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people at higher risk of serious flu complications who have flu infection or suspected flu infection.
People at increased risk
Adults 65 years and older
Children younger than 2 years old1
People with asthma
People with chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and cystic fibrosis)
People with neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions
People with blood disorders (such as sickle cell disease)
People with endocrine disorders (such as diabetes mellitus)
People with heart disease (such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease)
People with kidney disorders
People with liver disorders
People with metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders)
People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher
People younger than 19 years old on long-term aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications.
People with a weakened immune system due to disease (such as people with HIV or AIDS, or some cancers such as leukemia) or medications (such as those receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer, or persons with chronic conditions requiring chronic corticosteroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system)
People who have had a stroke
People with certain disabilities—especially those who may have trouble with muscle function, lung function, or difficulty coughing, swallowing, or clearing fluids from their airways.
Other people at higher risk from flu:
Pregnant women, including up to 2 weeks after the end of pregnancy
People who live in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities
People from certain racial and ethnic minority groups are at increased risk for hospitalization with flu, including non-Hispanic Black persons, Hispanic or Latino persons, and American Indian or Alaska Native persons
1 Although all children younger than 5 years old are considered at higher risk of serious flu complications, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years old, with the highest hospitalization and death rates among infants younger than 6 months old.
Flu and people with chronic conditions
Adults with certain chronic conditions are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu.
In fact, during recent flu seasons, 9 out of 10 people hospitalized with flu had at least one underlying health condition – that's why getting an annual flu vaccine is especially important for people with certain chronic health conditions
A flu vaccine reduces the risk of getting sick with flu. For people with certain chronic health conditions a flu vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of flu-related worsening of chronic conditions and prevent flu-associated hospitalization.
Prevention
Flu Vaccination is the Best Protection
The best way to prevent flu and its potentially serious complications is for everyone 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year. It is especially important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications to be vaccinated each year.
Other Preventive Actions
In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with asthma should take the same everyday preventive actions CDC recommends for everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies.
Treatment
CDC recommends early flu antiviral treatment for people who have flu or suspected flu who are at higher risk of serious flu complications.

Influenza (Flu)
Flu and People Living with HIV
WHAT TO KNOW
People with HIV (PWH) are at higher risk of serious flu-related complications.
Due to this risk, it is especially important that PWH get a flu shot each year.
If you have HIV and get sick with flu symptoms, call your doctor right away.
CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with HIV who have flu or suspected flu.
Populations at increased risk
People living with HIV (PWH) are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications, especially those who have a very low CD4 cell count (very suppressed immune system) or who are not taking medicine to treat HIV (called antiretroviral therapy, or ART). Of all PWH in the United States from 2018–19, 81% were prescribed ART, leaving nearly 20% potentially at increased risk for flu complications. Studies have indicated that flu symptoms might be prolonged and the risk of flu-related complications and prolonged influenza virus shedding
is higher for certain people living with HIV.
Because they are at higher risk of serious flu-related complications, it is especially important that PWH get a flu shot annually. PWH who are not receiving ART might not have as strong an immune response to vaccination as those who are receiving ART. PWH who get flu symptoms, especially those with low CD4 cell counts not receiving ART, should be treated with influenza antiviral drugs right away.
About HIV
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV attacks cells in the body's immune system called CD4 cells. If untreated, it gradually destroys the body's ability to fight infection and certain cancers. CDC estimates that nearly 1.2 million people in the United States 13 years and older were living with HIV at the end of 2019, the most recent year of available data.
Prevention
A flu shot is the best protection against flu
If you have HIV, you are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications, in addition to taking ART, the best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu shot.
Several randomized studies in adults living with HIV have shown that flu vaccination can reduce the risk of flu illness. Studies in the United States have shown that flu vaccination prevents illness and reduces the need for doctor's visits among PWH and other conditions resulting in immune suppression.
People living with HIV should get a flu shot (not the nasal spray flu vaccine) every year. Injectable flu vaccines (or flu shots) are recommended for use in PWH and other health conditions. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine [LAIV] (nasal spray) vaccine should not be used in people with HIV and AIDS. LAIV (FluMist®) contains a weakened form of the live influenza virus and is not recommended for use in people with weakened immune systems (immunosuppression).
Note: While PWH may still mount an immune response to flu vaccination, people with advanced HIV disease may not respond as well. Doctors may consider using influenza antiviral drugs for prevention in some cases.
Make a statement this flu season.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also important
Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death.
PWH should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination to protect against pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections.
You can get either Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (but not both) when you get a flu vaccine.
Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.
Keep Reading:
Pneumococcal Vaccination
Other preventive actions for people with living with HIV
In addition to getting a flu shot every year, people living with HIV should take the same everyday preventive actions CDC recommends of everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with viruses.

Institute for Healthcare Improvement, Model for Improvement

The Model for Improvement is a simple tool for accelerating improvement. The model is not meant to replace change models that organizations may already be using, but rather to accelerate improvement. This model has been used successfully by hundreds of health care organizations to improve many different health care processes and outcomes.
National Public Health Performance Standards Program
The National Public Health Performance Standards provide a framework to assess capacity and performance of public health systems and public health governing bodies. This framework can help identify areas for system improvement, strengthen state and local partnerships, and ensure that a strong system is in place for providing the 10 essential public health services.
Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP)

MAPP is a framework and tool for community health improvement developed by NACCHO and CDC.

About Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)
KEY POINTS
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the legs.
Other health conditions and disorders of arteries can mimic the symptoms of PAD.
What it is
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the legs or lower extremities is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the legs. It is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. PAD can happen in any blood vessel, but it is more common in the legs than the arms.
The image on the left shows a normal artery. The right shows an artery narrowed by atherosclerosis, causing PAD.
Signs and symptoms
The classic symptom of PAD is pain in the legs with physical activity, such as walking, that gets better after rest. However, up to 4 in 10 people with PAD have no leg pain.1 Symptoms of pain, aches, or cramps with walking (claudication) can happen in the buttock, hip, thigh, or calf.2
Physical signs in the leg that may indicate PAD include:
Muscle atrophy (weakness).
Hair loss.
Smooth, shiny skin.
Skin that is cool to the touch, especially if there is pain while walking (that is relieved by stopping walking).
Decreased or absent pulses in the feet.
Sores or ulcers in the legs or feet that don't heal.
Cold or numb toes.23
Risk factors
Smoking
High blood pressure
Atherosclerosis
Diabetes
High cholesterol
Age above 60 years
Both men and woman are affected by PAD; however, African Americans people have an increased risk of PAD. Hispanic people may have similar to slightly higher rates of PAD compared with non-Hispanic White people. Approximately 6.5 million people age 40 and older in the United States have PAD.1
Other health conditions and disorders of arteries can mimic the symptoms of PAD, and not all PAD is due to atherosclerosis.23
If you have PAD, you are at risk for developing coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, which could lead to a heart attack or stroke.4
Prevention
Get plenty of physical activity to help prevent PAD or improve symptoms of PAD.2
Do not use tobacco. Smoking increases the risk of PAD and makes PAD symptoms worse.4
Control high blood pressure and manage high blood cholesterol and diabetes.
If you have PAD, participating in supervised exercise training programs can improve and prolong your ability to walk longer distances.
Diagnosis
Prevalence of PAD (%) by age group (years)
The prevalence of PAD increases with age for both men and women.
If you have symptoms of PAD, your doctor may do an ankle brachial index (ABI). This is a noninvasive test that measures the blood pressure in the ankles and compares it with the blood pressure in the arms at rest and after exercise. Your doctor may also do imaging tests such as ultrasound
, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomographic (CT) angiography.123
Treatment and recovery
Your doctor may recommend that you take aspirin or other similar antiplatelet medicines. These medicines could prevent serious complications from PAD and associated atherosclerosis. You may also need to take medicine to reduce your blood cholesterol.24
If you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about ways to help you quit smoking.
You may need surgery to bypass blocked arteries.
A supervised exercise program is recommended for people with pain caused by too little blood flow to muscles. Such a program could improve quality of life, and reduce leg symptoms.5

Persons Who Inject Drugs (PWID)
Infectious Diseases in Persons Who Inject Drugs
KEY POINTS
A deadly consequence of the opioid crisis is increased blood-borne infections, including viral hepatitis, HIV, and bacterial and fungal infections.
Infections are spread through contaminated injection drug equipment, unsanitary conditions and low vaccination rates among at-risk populations.
What CDC is doing
A man deposits used syringes into a red disposal container.
CDC's infectious disease programs work to implement evidence-based prevention programs in school and community settings, and to stop the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV among people who inject drugs. Access to comprehensive prevention services is essential for all persons who inject drugs.
Syringe services programs (SSPs) are community-based prevention programs that can provide a range of services, including access to and disposal of sterile syringes and injection equipment, vaccination, testing, and linkage to infectious disease care and substance use treatment. Nearly 30 years of research shows that comprehensive syringe services programs (SSPs) are safe, effective, and cost-saving, do not increase illegal drug use or crime, and play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections. Below are a summary of CDC resources on infectious disease and injection drug use.

Whooping Cough (Pertussis)
Whooping Cough Vaccination
KEY POINTS
CDC recommends whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination for everyone.
Whooping cough vaccines are the best way to protect against whooping cough.
These vaccines work well, but protection fades over time.
Talk to a vaccine provider if you have questions about whooping cough vaccines.
Overview
CDC recommends whooping cough vaccines for people of all ages.
There are 2 types of combination vaccines that include protection against whooping cough:
DTaP
Tdap
The letter ""T"" in DTaP and Tdap shows they also help protect against tetanus. The letter ""D/d"" in DTaP and Tdap shows they also help protect against diphtheria.

Why getting vaccinated is important
Whooping cough affects people of all ages. Babies younger than 1 year old are at greatest risk for getting whooping cough and having severe complications from it.

Whooping Cough Vaccine Recommendations
Allergies, reactions: Talk with a vaccine provider
Talk to a vaccine provider about your vaccination history and a specific vaccine's ingredients. There may be times when someone shouldn't get DTaP or Tdap, like if they:
Had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the vaccine(s)
Have a life-threatening allergy to any part of the vaccine(s)
Additionally, discuss with a vaccine provider if a different vaccine other than DTaP or Tdap should be used. A vaccine provider may recommend a different vaccine if someone experienced encephalopathy within 7 days of receiving DTaP or Tdap. Encephalopathy is a brain disease that alters how the brain functions.
Feeling sick?
Generally, vaccination is fine during mild illnesses like a cold. A vaccine provider can advise on whether to get vaccinated or wait until you feel better.
Other guidelines
Tell the vaccine provider if you or your child:
Has seizures or another nervous system problem
Has ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (also called ""GBS"")
Had severe pain or swelling after a tetanus or diphtheria vaccine
How well they work
Vaccines that help protect against whooping cough work well but protection decreases over time.
Keep Reading:
How Well Whooping Cough Vaccines Work
Possible side effects
Most people who get a vaccine that helps protect against whooping cough don't have any serious problems. With any medicine, including vaccines, there's a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days, but serious reactions are possible.
Mild problems
DTaP vaccine
Swelling or soreness where the vaccine provider gave the vaccine
Fever
Irritability (fussiness)
Feeling tired
Loss of appetite
Vomiting
Tdap vaccine
Pain, redness, or swelling where the vaccine provider gave the vaccine
Mild fever
Headache
Feeling tired
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomachache
More serious reactions
More serious reactions after DTaP vaccination happen much less often than mild problems. They can include:
Seizures
Non-stop crying for 3 hours or more
High fever (over 105°F)
Rarely, DTaP vaccination is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg. While rare, if it happens it's usually in older children when they receive their fourth or fifth shot.

Vaccination locations
Children and teens
DTaP and Tdap are part of the routine childhood immunization schedule and regularly available for children at:
Pediatric and family practice offices
Community health clinics
Public health departments
Adults
For adults, a healthcare provider's office or pharmacy are usually the best places to receive recommended vaccines. If your healthcare provider doesn't have Tdap vaccine, ask for a referral.
Federally funded health centers can also provide services if you don't have a regular source of health care. Locate one near you
.
You can also contact your health department to learn more about where to get vaccines in your community.
Vaccine costs
There are several ways to cover the cost of DTaP and Tdap vaccines:
Private health insurance
Most private health insurance plans cover this vaccine. Check with your insurance provider for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children program
The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program provides vaccines to children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them.

The Pesticide Illness and Injury Surveillance Program was developed to examine over-exposure to pesticides in the workplace.
We use this knowledge to prevent these exposures from happening. This kind of surveillance also serves as an early warning system for any harmful effects not detected by pesticide manufacturer testing.
Data sources
We use two data sources to monitor the trends in pesticide-related illnesses and injuries that occur on the job:
SENSOR-Pesticides (Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risk-Pesticides) program data
National Poison Data System (NPDS) data
SENSOR-Pesticides data
EXPAND ALL
The SENSOR Program
builds and maintains occupational illness and injury surveillance within state health departments.
One of the conditions supported under SENSOR is acute occupational pesticide-related illness and injury. This is referred to as the ""SENSOR-Pesticides"" program. Using cooperative agreement funds from NIOSH and the EPA, health departments conduct surveillance on acute occupational pesticide-related illnesses or injuries.

Pet Travel Safety
WHAT TO KNOW
Plan ahead of time if including pets in your travel plans.
Microchip your pet and make sure your contact information is updated.
Make sure your pet's vaccinations are up to date.
Check regulations and required documentation for your destination before traveling.
Preparing for travel with pets
Owning a pet can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and explore new places. You may want to take your pet with you when you travel to new places. Traveling can sometimes be stressful, both for you and your pets. Preparation can help prevent stress and keep you and your pets safe and healthy.
Before traveling, properly identify your pet in case you get separated during your trip. Make sure your pet is microchipped for identification and keep your contact and pet information updated.
Keeping pets safe in the car
Having a smooth and safe road trip with your pet requires preparation and planning, especially if driving long distances.
To prepare your pet, take them on a series of short drives and gradually increase the amount of time spent in the car.
Before traveling across state lines, check the requirements for bringing pets along.
If your pet is riding on the seat, keep them in the back seat in a harness attached to the seat buckle to prevent injury. Allowing pets to roam around the car or ride with their head outside the window can be dangerous.
If your pet is kept in their crate, check that your pet can stand, sit, lie down, and turn around while inside the crate. Also, make sure the crate is well ventilated. Secure the crate so it won't slide or shift when the car stops.
Bring plenty of water, food, a bowl, leash, waste bags, grooming supplies, medication and first-aid, and any travel documents including proof of rabies vaccination. Feed your pet 3 to 4 hours before leaving on your trip to prevent car sickness or vomiting.
Make frequent stops to allow dogs to go to the bathroom and stretch their legs.
Never leave your pet alone in a parked vehicle. On hot days, temperatures can rise quickly within minutes and can cause death. In cold weather, animals left in cars can freeze to death.
Keeping pets safe on airplanes
Traveling with pets by plane takes careful preparation and planning and could also be costly. If you must bring your pet on a flight, here are suggestions to keep your pet safe:
Weeks before your trip
Book a direct flight when possible to decrease the chances of your pet being separated from you during extreme weather or layovers.
Check your pet's vaccinations to make sure they are up to date. Get a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of your departure. For international travel, additional planning and healthcare requirements may be needed. Research the requirements for pets for your destination country
as well as for the United States. When returning to the United States from abroad, your dog must meet all US entry requirements upon return.
For animals stowed in the plane's cargo area, purchase a US Department of Agriculture-approved shipping crate. The crate must be large enough for your pet to stand, sit, and turn around in comfortably.
Before heading to the airport
Line the cargo crate with some type of bedding—shredded paper or towels—to absorb potential accidents. Place a small dish of water in the crate. Check the crate door is securely closed but not locked, so airline staff can open it in case of an emergency.
Your pet's crate should have proper identification if shipped as cargo. Mark ""live animal"" on the crate, and include your name, cell phone, and destination phone number.
At the airport
Before departure or after arrival, give your dog a potty break before securing it in the crate for travel.
On the plane
Keep pets in carriers and follow airline policies when bringing them on planes.
If hand-carried, never place your pet in an overhead bin. Pets must be secured in their crates below the seat in front of you in accordance with airline policies.
International travel with pets
There are several requirements for traveling abroad with pets.
Learn more
Prevent injury and illness when traveling
Keep pets on a leash when traveling to prevent illness and injury.
Practice safe and healthy habits to prevent your pet from getting sick or hurt on trips. Some diseases pets may be at risk for while traveling include rabies, leptospirosis, campylobacteriosis, and diseases spread by mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks like Lyme disease and West Nile virus. Some of these diseases can spread between people and animals.
Always supervise pets while traveling and on adventures.
Keep your pet in a carrier or on a leash.
Don't allow pets to interact with other animals, especially street dogs, stray animals or wild animals.
Don't let pets swim in, play in, or drink stagnant water or water that looks discolored, smells bad, has foam, scum, algal mats, or paint-like streaks on the surface, or has dead fish or other animals washed up on its shore or beach. Some bodies of water contain harmful algal blooms that can make people and pets sick.
Check pets for ticks after outdoor outings and talk to your veterinarian about use of a regular preventive treatment for fleas, ticks, and parasites.
First aid when traveling
Keep basic first-aid supplies for your pet in your car. You can use a travel-sized first-aid kit for your pet on flights.
Keep the phone numbers of your veterinarian, the National Animal Poison Control Center of the ASPCA (1-888-426-4435), and a 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital in the area where you will be visiting, easily accessible.
Perform a daily health check on your pet when away from home to assess their physical and behavioral changes. If you have concerns about your pet, contact your veterinarian or a local veterinarian.
Always remember: follow up any first aid administered to your pet with immediate veterinary care. First-aid care is not a substitute for veterinary care, but it may save your pet's life until veterinary treatment is available.

Genomics and Your Health
Pharmacogenomics
KEY POINTS
Pharmacogenomics looks at how your DNA affects the way you respond to drugs.
Understanding this can lead to better health outcomes by helping you know ahead of time whether a drug is likely to benefit you and be safe for you to take.
Knowing this information can help your healthcare provider find medicines that will work best for you.
What it is
Pharmacogenomics is an important example of the field of precision medicine, which aims to tailor medical treatment to each person or to a group of people. Pharmacogenomics looks at how your DNA affects the way you respond to drugs. In some cases, your DNA can affect whether you have a bad reaction to a drug or whether a drug helps you or has no effect. Pharmacogenomics can improve your health by helping you know ahead of time whether a drug is likely to benefit you and be safe for you to take. Knowing this information can help your healthcare provider find medicine that will work best for you.
How it works
Drugs interact with your body in many ways, depending both on how you take the drug and where the drug acts in your body. After you take a drug, your body needs to break it down and get it to the intended area. Your DNA can affect multiple steps in this process to influence how you respond to the drug. Some examples of these interactions are described here.
Drug receptors
Some drugs need to attach to proteins on the surface of cells, called receptors, in order to work properly. Your DNA determines what type of receptors you have, and how many, which can affect your response to the drug. You might need a higher or lower amount of the drug than most people, or you might need a different drug.
The number and type of receptors on your cells can affect how you respond to a drug.
EXAMPLE: Breast cancer and T-DM1. Some breast cancers make too much HER2, a receptor, and this extra HER2 helps the cancer develop and spread. The drug T-DM1 can be used to treat this type of breast cancer and works by attaching to HER2 on cancerous cells and killing them. If you have breast cancer, your healthcare provider may test a sample of your tumor to determine if T-DM1 is the right treatment for you. If your tumor has a high amount of HER2 (HER2 positive), your healthcare provider may prescribe T-DM1. If your tumor does not have enough HER2 (HER2 negative), T-DM1 will not work for you.
Drug uptake
Some drugs need to be actively taken into the tissues and cells in which they act. Your DNA can affect uptake of certain drugs. Decreased uptake can mean that the drug does not work as well and can cause it to build up in other parts of your body, which can cause problems. Your DNA can also affect how quickly some drugs are removed from the cells in which they act. If drugs are removed from the cells too quickly, they might not have time to act.
If your cells have decreased uptake of a drug, the drug can build up and cause problems.
EXAMPLE: Statins and muscle problems. Statins are a type of drug that act in the liver to help lower cholesterol. In order for statins to work correctly, they must first be taken into the liver. Statins are transported into the liver by a protein made by the SLCO1B1 gene. Some people have a specific change in this gene that causes less of a statin called simvastatin to be taken into the liver. When taken at high doses, simvastatin can build up in the blood, causing muscle problems, including weakness and pain. Before prescribing simvastatin, your healthcare provider may recommend genetic testing for the SLCO1B1 gene to check if simvastatin is the best statin for you or to determine what dose would work best.
Drug breakdown
Your DNA can affect how quickly your body breaks down a drug. If you break the drug down more quickly than most people, your body gets rid of the drug faster and you might need more of the drug or a different drug. If your body breaks the drug down more slowly, you might need less of the drug.
If your body breaks down a drug more quickly than most people, you might need more of the drug or a different drug. If your body breaks down a drug more slowly than most people, you might need less of the drug.
EXAMPLE: Depression and amitriptyline. The breakdown of the antidepressant drug amitriptyline is influenced by two genes called CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. If your healthcare provider prescribes amitriptyline, they might recommend genetic testing for the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes to help decide what dose of the drug you need. If you break down amitriptyline too fast, you will need a higher dose for it to work, or you may need to use a different drug. If you break down amitriptyline very slowly, you will need to take a smaller dose or will need to take a different drug to avoid a bad reaction.
Targeted drug development
Pharmacogenomic approaches to drug development target the underlying problem rather than just treating symptoms. Some diseases are caused by specific changes (mutations) in a gene. The same gene can have different types of changes, which have different effects. Some genetic changes may result in a protein that does not work correctly, while others may mean that the protein is not made at all. Drugs can be created based on how the genetic change affects the protein, and these drugs will only work for a specific type of genetic change.
EXAMPLE: Cystic fibrosis and ivacaftor. Cystic fibrosis is caused by genetic changes in the CFTR gene that affect the CFTR protein. The CFTR protein forms a channel, which acts as a passageway to move particles across the cells in your body. For most people the protein is made correctly, and the channel can open and close. Some genetic changes that cause cystic fibrosis result in a channel that is closed. The drug ivacaftor acts on this type of genetic change by forcing the channel open. Ivacaftor would not be expected to work for people with cystic fibrosis whose genetic change causes the channel not to be made at all.
People who do not have cystic fibrosis have a CFTR channel that can open and close.
Some people with cystic fibrosis have a CFTR channel that cannot open. The drug ivacaftor acts to open the channel.
Some people with cystic fibrosis do not make the channel. The drug would not be expected to work for these people.
What it means for you
While pharmacogenomic testing is currently used for only a few drugs, the field is growing very quickly. Improved understanding of how pharmacogenomics can protect your health and improve your treatment will be increasingly important. Talk to your healthcare provider about what pharmacogenomics might mean for your health.

Chemical Emergencies
Phosgene
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Phosgene is a toxic gas or liquid that can cause damage to the skin, eyes, nose, throat, and lungs.
Signs and symptoms depend on how the amount of phosgene, how the person was exposed, and for how long.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Phosgene, known as ""CG"" in the military, is a major industrial chemical used to make plastics and pesticides.
Phosgene is a toxic gas or liquid that can cause damage to the skin, eyes, nose, throat, and lungs.
Possible characteristics of phosgene include:
Colorless or white to pale yellow at room temperature
Smell of newly mown hay or green corn at low levels
Strong and unpleasant smell at high levels
For shipping or storing, phosgene is turned into a liquid by cooling and applying pressure.
When liquid phosgene is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground and spreads quickly.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long.
Keep in mind
Some people with asthma or other chronic lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing phosgene than others.
During or immediately after exposure to dangerous levels of phosgene, the following signs and symptoms may develop:
Chest tightness
Coughing
Choking
Burning sensation in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes
Blurred vision and/or eyes tearing
Breathing problems, shortness of breath, or rapid shallow breathing
Frostbite if exposed to liquid phosgene
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
These signs and symptoms may also be delayed for up to 48 hours.
There are other delayed effects that may not show for up to 48 hours. These effects include:
Difficulty breathing
Coughing up white to pink-colored fluid (sign of pulmonary edema)
Low blood pressure
Respiratory failure
Heart failure
People who have been exposed to phosgene should be monitored during the 48-hour period.
Exposure
Air
If phosgene is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the phosgene gas. Because phosgene gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase the chance of exposure there.
The smell of phosgene is not a good enough warning that there is a dangerous level in the air. At low levels of phosgene, the irritating signs and symptoms can be mild and delayed. This could cause people to not leave an unsafe area and continue to breathe in phosgene.
Food
Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with phosgene can expose people to phosgene. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Avoid eating food that may have touched phosgene if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by phosgene. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Water
People can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains phosgene. If clothing has touched liquid phosgene, people can be exposed by touching the clothing or phosgene vapors (gas) from the clothing.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the phosgene was released and breathe fresh air.
If the phosgene release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the phosgene does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the phosgene was released.
If the phosgene release was indoors, get out of the building.
If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible because phosgene is heavier than air and will sink.

Responding to Chemical Emergencies
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering as soon as you can. Showering is the best method for removing phosgene from your body.
Ideally, undress, blot, and shower immediately or as soon as you can, as described below. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take off your clothes
If clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes.
Avoid pulling clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the phosgene from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Drop clothes to the floor.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
Follow these steps to blot your body:
Use different dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Start blotting with your head and hair.
Then blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
First wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with a lot of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds. Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10 to 15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch phosgene. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.

About Getting Clean
Get help
Call 911, go to the hospital (if local officials say it is safe to leave), or call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.

Check the radio, television, mobile news app, or text message alerts for more information.
Treatment
No known cure exists for phosgene exposure.
Treatment involves removing phosgene from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Supportive medical care can be given in a hospital setting or by trained emergency responders.
If someone has swallowed phosgene, do not force vomiting.
Long-term health effects
Most people who recover after an exposure to phosgene make a complete recovery.
However, exposure may lead to chronic bronchitis (long-term inflammation in the lungs) and emphysema (lung condition that causes shortness of breath).
Exposure to phosgene can also lead to reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS), asthma caused by chemicals.
Chemical Emergencies
Phosgene Oxime
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Phosgene oxime is a chemical warfare agent that causes strong itching and a rash similar to hives.
Signs and symptoms happen immediately after exposure.
Phosgene oxime has different effects on specific parts of the body.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Phosgene oxime, known as ""CX"" in the military, is a human-made chemical warfare agent. Phosgene oxime was first made in 1929, but it has never been used on the battlefield.
Phosgene oxime is a type of agent called an urticant or nettle agent. It causes strong itching and a rash similar to hives when it touches the skin. Phosgene oxime is also called a corrosive agent because it causes a specific type of skin and tissue damage.
There is limited specific information on this chemical. It can be described as:
Colorless as a solid.
Yellowish brown as a liquid.
An unlikeable and irritating scent.
Where it is found
Phosgene oxime is not found naturally in the environment.
Phosgene oxime has never been used during wartime, despite being made as a chemical warfare agent.
Phosgene oxime vapor (gas) is heavier than air, so it will settle in lower areas. Phosgene oxime does not last in the environment for very long. It breaks down in soil within 2 hours when temperatures are normal. It breaks down in water within a few days.
How it works
Phosgene oxime causes instant and almost unbearable pain on exposed skin and eyes. When breathed in, it causes immediate irritation to the respiratory (breathing) tract. Phosgene oxime can go through clothing and rubber faster than other chemical warfare agents.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms occur immediately following a phosgene oxime exposure. The level of phosgene oxime poisoning depends on the amount exposed, how the person is exposed, and for how long.
Phosgene oxime can have the different effects on specific parts of the body.
Showing these signs or symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to phosgene oxime.
Eyes
Signs and symptoms include severe pain and irritation and eye tearing. There is also possible temporary blindness.
Respiratory tract
Signs and symptoms include:
Immediate irritation to the upper respiratory (breathing) tract
Runny nose
Hoarseness
Sinus pain
Getting phosgene oxime through the skin or breathing it in may cause:
Fluid build up in the lungs (pulmonary edema).
Shortness of breath.
Cough.
Skin
In a few seconds: Pain occurs.
In 30 seconds: Blanching (whitening) of the skin circled by red rings will occur.
In about 15 minutes: Skin starts showing hives.
After 24 hours: Whitened areas of skin become brown and die and a scab is formed.
Itching and pain may continue as you heal.
Exposure
People's chance of exposure depends on how close they are to the place where the phosgene oxime was released.
Air: People can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing it in.
Water: People can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains phosgene oxime.
Food: People can be exposed by eating the food. People can also be exposed directly by touching liquid phosgene oxime.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get fresh air by leaving the area where the phosgene oxime is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chances of exposure to phosgene oxime.
If phosgene oxime was released outside, move away from the area. Go to the highest ground possible, because phosgene oxime is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas.
If phosgene oxime was released indoors, get out of the building.

Responding to Chemical Emergencies
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. If you swallowed phosgene oxime, do not force vomiting or drink fluids. Call 911 and tell them what happened.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing with liquid phosgene oxime on it as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas and take off the clothing as quickly as possible.
Wash your body
Wash any phosgene oxime from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you and others from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
If possible, put the clothing in a plastic bag. Then put the first plastic bag in a second plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
If you put your clothes in bags, let the local or state health department or emergency personnel know when they come. Do not handle the plastic bags.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
There is no cure for phosgene oxime.
Treatment involves removing the phosgene oxime from the body as soon as possible. Treatment also includes providing supportive medical care in a hospital setting.
Long-term health effects
No information is available on the long-term health effects of phosgene oxime in humans.

Lice
PARASITES 
About Pubic ""Crab"" Lice
KEY POINTS
Pubic lice, also known as ""crab"" lice, are parasitic insects found in the pubic or genital area.
They are usually spread by sexual contact.
Symptoms include itching or visible lice in the genital area.
Both prescription and over-the-counter treatments can treat pubic lice.
Overview
Pubic lice are parasitic insects that feed on human blood. They are short and crab-like and look very different from head and body lice. Pubic lice typically attach to hair in the pubic area. Adult pubic lice are 1.1–1.8 mm in length (size of a pencil tip).
Either over-the-counter or prescription medications can treat pubic lice infestations. Infestation or infested person means that a person has lice.
Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of pubic lice include:
Itching in the genital area
Visible nits (lice eggs)
Lice crawling or attached to pubic hair
Lice in other hairy areas (eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, mustache, armpits, chest, back)
Pubic lice do not transmit disease. However, you could get sores and a bacterial infection from intense scratching.
Who is at risk
Anyone can get pubic lice. Pubic lice usually spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults.
How it spreads
You usually get pubic lice from intimate, person-to-person contact, usually sexual contact. Occasionally pubic lice can spread by clothing, bedding, or (very rarely) using a toilet seat that was just used by a person infested with public lice.
Adult pubic lice are found only on humans and require blood to survive. They will die within 24 – 48 hours without a blood meal. Female adult pubic lice lay about 30 eggs during their 3 – 4-week life span. Eggs hatch after about a week. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) mature into adults over 6 to 9 days.
Animals do not get or spread pubic lice.
Pubic lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication of sexual exposure or abuse.
Prevention
The following are steps that can help prevent and control the spread of pubic (""crab"") lice:
Examine yourself and seek treatment if you experience any of the symptoms of pubic lice or a sexual partner has recently had pubic lice.
All sexual contacts should be examined. All those who are infested should be treated.
Avoid all sexual contact with others until treatment is successful.
Machine wash and dry worn clothing and used bedding by the infested person in the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store them for two weeks.
Do not share clothing, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with pubic lice.
Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control pubic (""crab"") lice. They can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
Diagnosis
Pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a ""crab"" louse or nits on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body. These areas include the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, groin, torso, scalp, or anus. Pubic lice are short and crab-like; they appear very different from head and body lice (I.e., they are broader and flatter than other lice). Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to see them.
Lice found on the head generally are head lice, not pubic lice.
If you are unsure about infestation or if treatment is not successful, see a healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Consider getting tested for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
Treatment and recovery
You can treat pubic lice with a lice-killing lotion containing 1% permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide.
These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription at a local drug store or pharmacy. These medications are safe and effective when used exactly according to the instructions in the package or on the label.

Information on Swine / Variant Influenza
About Swine/Variant Flu
WHAT TO KNOW
Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs.
Influenza viruses that commonly circulate in swine are called “swine influenza viruses” or “swine flu viruses.”
Like human influenza viruses, there are different subtypes and strains of swine influenza viruses.
The main swine influenza viruses circulating in U.S. pigs in recent years have been, swine triple reassortant (tr) H1N1 influenza virus, trH3N2 virus, and trH1N2 virus.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called ""variant viruses."" They also can be denoted by adding the letter ""v"" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States.

Pinworm Infection
PARASITES 
About Pinworm Infection
KEY POINTS
Pinworm infection is caused by small, thin, white parasitic roundworms.
Anyone can get pinworm infection, but it primarily affects children, people in long-term care facilities, and household members and caretakers of persons with pinworm infections.
Medication, handwashing, and good hygiene are the best ways to stop the spread of pinworm.
Overview
Pinworms are a type of parasitic roundworm that can infect your intestines. Parasites are organisms (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Pinworm infection causes itching around the anus (butthole). Anyone can get a pinworm infection, but it usually affects children, people living with or caring for children, and people living in long-term care facilities or institutional settings. Pinworm infection is preventable and treatable.
On average, a single pinworm is about the size of a staple. The scientific name for a pinworm is Enterobius vermicularis and some healthcare providers may use the terms enterobiasis or oxyuriasis to refer to pinworm infection.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of pinworm infection are usually mild, and some people have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, it is typically itching around the anus. Female pinworms lay their eggs at night on the skin around the anus, which can cause the skin to itch. Some infected people have difficulty sleeping or restlessness. Some infected people have reported abdominal pain. Occasionally, pinworms can move to the vaginal area, causing irritation and inflammation. Repeated scratching can make the skin red and puffy and lead to bacterial skin infections—in addition to the pinworm infection.
Risk factors
Pinworm infection occurs worldwide. Pinworms can infect anyone, in any setting, and are the most common worm infection in the United States. Pinworm infection occurs most commonly among
School-aged and preschool-aged children,
People in institutional settings, and
Household members and caretakers of people with pinworm infection.
Pinworm infections often occur in more than one person in a household. It is common to see multiple infections in institutional and childcare settings as pinworms spread easily.
How it spreads
While an infected person sleeps, female pinworms leave the intestine through the anus and deposit their eggs on the surrounding skin. Two to three hours after pinworms lay their eggs, the eggs become capable of infecting other people who accidentally swallow them. The eggs can easily infect another person, especially caretakers or close contacts of infected children or adults:
If, after they touch an infected area around the anus, or get eggs under their fingernails, they then touch their mouth.
After pinworm eggs get onto diapers, clothes, bedding, food, or other items, the worms could then make it from the object to someone's mouth. (If not properly washed or cleaned, pinworm eggs can survive 2 – 3 weeks on objects.)
When pinworm eggs, which are tiny, float through the air and someone breaths them in then swallows them (rare).
Prevention
Washing your hands with soap and warm water is the best way to prevent pinworm infection. This is especially important after
Using the toilet
Changing diapers, and
Touching people who have pinworm or handling items they have used.
Always wash your hands before handling food. Teach children the importance of washing their hands thoroughly and often.
Repeated infections are common. Treat everyone—people infected with pinworms, their caretakers, and members of their household—with the same two-dose treatment. Learn more prevention methods and how to prevent multiple infections and spread.
Diagnosis
If you or someone you know is showing signs of a pinworm infection, speak with your healthcare provider. There are three ways, with your help, your provider can diagnose pinworm infection:
Look for pinworms around the anus 2 – 3 hours after the who may be infected person goes to sleep.
Conduct a ""tape test"" to collect possible pinworm eggs around the anus.
Look at samples from under the fingernails of the person who may have pinworms.
Learn more about the specific steps to take on the Diagnosis page.
Treatment and recovery
There are medications, both over the counter and prescription, that can treat pinworm infection. If you or someone you care for are experiencing symptoms of pinworm infection, talk with your healthcare provider to be properly diagnosed.
Treat everyone in the same household and caregivers of the person diagnosed with pinworms at the same time. Treatment involves two doses of medication with the second dose given two weeks after the first dose. The medications kill worms but cannot kill eggs. The second dose is important to prevent infection by newly hatched adult worms that were not killed by the first treatment because they were still eggs.

Plague
About Plague
KEY POINTS
Plague is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis.
Plague occurs naturally in areas of the western United States, where it circulates among wild rodents and other animals.
Plague can be cured with antibiotics, but treatment must be given quickly.
Overview
Plague is a disease that affects humans and other mammals. It is caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis. Humans usually become infected through the bite of an infected rodent flea or by handling an infected animal. Plague can be cured with antibiotics, but these must be given promptly to prevent serious illness or death. Plague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Nowadays, it is a rare but persistent cause of illness in rural areas in the western United States and certain regions of Africa and Asia.

Pneumoconioses Disease
About Pneumoconioses
KEY POINTS
The pneumoconioses are a group of lung diseases caused by the lung’s reaction when breathing in certain dusts.
The main cause of the pneumoconioses is workplace exposure.
All forms of pneumoconioses can be severe.
Overview
Healthy lung versus black lung.
The primary pneumoconioses are:
Abestosis – caused by inhaling asbestos fibers
Silicosis – caused by inhaling silica dust
Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (commonly referred to as CWP or black lung) caused by inhaling coal mine dust
There is also a form called mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Byssinosis, caused by exposure to cotton dust, is sometimes included with pneumoconioses. Although the pattern of lung abnormality in Byssinosis is different from the types of disease listed above. Also, many consider the term pneumoconosis as referring only to diseases caused by inhaling mineral dusts.
Pneumoconiosis typically takes years to develop. However, rapidly progressive forms of silicosis can occur after short periods of intense exposure. When severe, the diseases often lead to lung impairment, disability, and premature death. Pneumoconioses can be avoided through appropriate dust control.
Other forms of pneumoconiosis can be caused by inhaling dusts containing:
Aluminum
Antimony
Barium
Graphite
Iron
Kaolin
Mica
Talc
Symptoms
Pneumoconiosis symptoms depend on how severe the disease is. They include:
Shortness of breath
Coughing
Increased phlegm
Diagnosis
Identifying and classifying pneumoconioses
Lung x-ray showing pneumoconiosis in coal miner.
The pneumoconioses are typically detected through radiological imaging. Severity of lung impairment can be assessed using pulmonary function tests. The International Labor Office (ILO) provides guidelines
for classifying radiographs of the pneumoconioses.
NIOSH operates the B Reader Program. This program allows physicians to document their proficiency in classifying radiographs (using ILO guidelines) by taking an examination.
Treatment
Pneumoconiosis cannot be cured. Controlling symptoms through proper treatment is vital. Workers should avoid exposure to dust and smoking. Treatment may include oxygen or medications that help to open lung passages. Workers should see a doctor if they have symptoms they suspect are related to their workplace.
Resources

Pneumocystis Pneumonia
FUNGAL DISEASES
Pneumocystis Pneumonia Basics
KEY POINTS
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a serious lung infection that affects people with weakened immune systems.
PCP is airborne, spreading person-to-person, and can cause symptoms, like fever, cough, and chest pain.
Treatment for PCP must include prescription medication.
PCP can cause death without treatment.
Overview
Pneumocystis  pneumonia (PCP) is a rare, serious lung infection caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. Most people with PCP have a weakened immune system due to a medical condition, like HIV, or from medication, like corticosteroids.
Pneumocystis pneumonia is a risk for people with health conditions.
Symptoms
The symptoms of PCP can develop over several days or weeks and include:
Fever
Cough
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Chills
Fatigue (tiredness)
Risk factors
Most people who get PCP have weakened immune systems. Some diseases and conditions that increase risk of PCP include:
HIV/AIDS (About 30% to 40% of people who get PCP have HIV/AIDS)
Chronic lung diseases
Cancer
Inflammatory diseases or autoimmune diseases (for example, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis)
Solid organ or stem cell transplant
The other people who get PCP are usually taking medicine (such as corticosteroids) that lowers the body’s ability to fight germs or sickness.
How it spreads
PCP spreads from person to person through the air. Some healthy adults can carry the Pneumocystis  fungus in their lungs without having symptoms. They can spread it to other people, including those with weakened immune systems.
Prevention
There is no vaccine to prevent PCP. Medicine to prevent PCP are recommended for people living with HIV, stem cell transplant patients, and some solid organ transplant patients. Healthcare providers might also prescribe medicine to prevent PCP in other patients, such as people who are taking long-term, high-dose corticosteroids.
The medicine most commonly used to prevent PCP is called trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Other medicines are available for people who cannot take TMP/SMX.
Testing
Healthcare providers test for PCP by taking a sample of mucus (sputum) from the patient's lungs. Sometimes, a small sample of lung tissue (a biopsy) is used to diagnose PCP or take a blood sample.
Samples are analyzed in clinical laboratories. One method that can be used is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which detects PCP DNA. A blood test to detect β-D-glucan (a part of the cell wall of many different types of fungi) can also help diagnose PCP.
Treatment and recovery
PCP is treated with prescription medication. The most common treatment is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), a medication also known as co-trimoxazole and by several different brand names, i.e. Bactrim, Septra, and Cotrim. This medicine is given by mouth or through a vein for 3 weeks.
TMP/SMX can cause side effects such as rash and fever. Other medications are available for patients who cannot take TMP/SMX.
Note: Most fungal diseases are treated with antifungal medications. Antibiotics typically are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Unlike other fungal diseases PCP is treated with an antibiotic and antifungal medications do not work to treat it.
Research
There is no national surveillance for PCP in the United States. There were 10,590 estimated U.S. hospitalizations due to Pneumocystis pneumonia in 2017.
History of HIV and PCP
During the 1980s, clusters of PCP were one of the first signs of the HIV/AIDS epidemic emerging in the United States. It became one of the main AIDS-defining illnesses with an estimated three-in-four people living with HIV/AIDS developed PCP.
Since then, PCP in people living with HIV has decreased substantially due to antiretroviral therapy and treatment with TMP/SMX. In some developing countries that lack access to these treatments, PCP remains a common infection among people living with HIV.

FUNGAL DISEASES
Pneumocystis Pneumonia Basics
KEY POINTS
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a serious lung infection that affects people with weakened immune systems.
PCP is airborne, spreading person-to-person, and can cause symptoms, like fever, cough, and chest pain.
Treatment for PCP must include prescription medication.
PCP can cause death without treatment.
Overview
Pneumocystis  pneumonia (PCP) is a rare, serious lung infection caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. Most people with PCP have a weakened immune system due to a medical condition, like HIV, or from medication, like corticosteroids.
Pneumocystis pneumonia is a risk for people with health conditions.
Symptoms
The symptoms of PCP can develop over several days or weeks and include:
Fever
Cough
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Chills
Fatigue (tiredness)
Risk factors
Most people who get PCP have weakened immune systems. Some diseases and conditions that increase risk of PCP include:
HIV/AIDS (About 30% to 40% of people who get PCP have HIV/AIDS)
Chronic lung diseases
Cancer
Inflammatory diseases or autoimmune diseases (for example, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis)
Solid organ or stem cell transplant
The other people who get PCP are usually taking medicine (such as corticosteroids) that lowers the body’s ability to fight germs or sickness.
How it spreads
PCP spreads from person to person through the air. Some healthy adults can carry the Pneumocystis  fungus in their lungs without having symptoms. They can spread it to other people, including those with weakened immune systems.
Prevention
There is no vaccine to prevent PCP. Medicine to prevent PCP are recommended for people living with HIV, stem cell transplant patients, and some solid organ transplant patients. Healthcare providers might also prescribe medicine to prevent PCP in other patients, such as people who are taking long-term, high-dose corticosteroids.

Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP)
Ventilator-associated Pneumonia Basics
KEY POINTS
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can develop when a patient is on a ventilator.
VAP can be treated with antibiotics.
There are ways to reduce the risk of a patient contracting VAP.
Overview
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a type of healthcare-associated infection (HAI). It is a lung infection that develops in a person who is on a ventilator.
Causes
VAP happens when bacteria get into a patient's lungs and cause an infection.
Reducing risk
Quit smoking. Patients who smoke get more infections. Seek information about how to quit before surgery.
Ask healthcare providers to clean their hands before touching the patient or equipment.
Ask about raising the head of the bed.
Ask when the patient can try breathing without a ventilator.
Ask how often healthcare providers clean the patient's mouth.
Healthcare providers should always follow Core Infection Prevention and Control Practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Acute care hospitals should use strategies to prevent VAP
.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment generally includes antibiotics, but the type of antibiotic depends on the bacteria causing the infection. The healthcare provider will decide which antibiotic is best.
What CDC is doing
Tracking VAP infections through the National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by VAP and slow the spread of resistant germs.

AT A GLANCE
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death if inhaled.
Find quick facts about CO poisoning and what can be done to prevent it.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill.
Many household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and charcoal grills produce this poison gas.
Symptoms
The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as “flu-like.”
If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping or drunk can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms.
Risk factors
Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning. Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO.
Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 100,000 visit the emergency room, and more than 14,000 are hospitalized.
Reducing risk
CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps.
CO detectors
Replace your CO detector following manufacturer instructions
Install battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors near every sleeping area in your home.
Check CO detector batteries when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly.
Consider buying a detector with a digital readout. This type of detector can tell you the highest level of CO concentration in your home, in addition to sounding an alarm.
Replace your CO detector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years. Set a reminder on your smartphone or other device calendar when you purchase and install the detector.
Oil and gas furnaces and other household appliances
Have your heating system serviced annually
Have your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year.
Make sure your gas appliances are vented properly. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors, as shown below. This prevents CO from leaking if the joints or pipes aren't fitted tightly.
When you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a national testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories.
If you smell an odor from your gas refrigerator, have an expert service it. An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it could be leaking CO.
Never heat your house with a gas oven. Don't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented.
Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors
Chimneys, charcoal, and portable appliances
Have your chimney checked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris, which can cause CO to build up inside your home or cabin.
Never burn charcoal indoors. Burning charcoal - red, gray, black, or white - gives off CO.
Never use a portable gas camp stove indoors. Do not use portable flameless chemical heaters indoors.
Portable generators
Download
Operate your generator outdoors more than 20 feet from windows, doors, and vents to avoid CO poisoning
Never use a generator inside your home or garage, even if doors and windows are open.
Only use generators outside, more than 20 feet away from any windows, doors, and vents.
When using a generator, use a battery-powered or battery backup CO detector in your home.
If you have a had a poisoning incident related to any generator...
Let the Consumer Product Safety Commission know!
Report it now
Automobile
Have a mechanic check the exhaust system of your car or truck every year. A small leak in the exhaust system can lead to a buildup of CO inside the car.
Never run your car or truck inside a garage that is attached to a house, even with the garage door open. Always open the door to a detached garage to let in fresh air when you run a car or truck inside.
If you drive a car or SUV with a tailgate, when you open the tailgate open the vents or windows to make sure air is moving through. If only the tailgate is open, CO from the exhaust will be pulled into the car or SUV.

Poisonous Plants and Work
KEY POINTS
Poisonous plants that can cause skin irritation include poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.
Burning poisonous plants may lead to lung irritation.
Employers and workers can take actions to stay safe.
Overview
Many plants are poisonous to humans when ingested or through skin contact with plant chemicals. The most common problems with poisonous plants arise from contact with the sap oil. Several plants native to the United States can cause an allergic skin reaction. These include poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. Workers may also develop lung irritation from contact with burning poisonous plants.
Any workers who spend time outside are at risk of exposure to poisonous plants. Some jobs include:
Farmers
Landscapers and gardeners
Painters
Roofers
Construction workers
Forestry workers
Firefighters
Geographic distribution
Poisonous plant species are found throughout the United States (except Alaska and Hawaii).
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has maps showing the geographic location of:
Western poison ivy
Eastern poison ivy
Pacific poison oak
Atlantic poison oak
Poison Sumac
Types
Identifying poisonous plants
The old saying “Leaves of three, let it be!” is a helpful reminder for identifying poison ivy and poison oak. However, it does not apply to poison sumac, which usually has clusters of 7–13 leaves.
In some species, poison ivy and poison oak may also have more than three leaves. Their appearance may also vary depending upon the species, the local environment, and the season. There may also be common lookalike plants in the same areas.
Poison Ivy
Poison ivy: Photos courtesy of U.S. Department of Agriculture
Eastern poison ivy is typically a hairy, ropelike vine with three shiny green leaves budding from one small stem. The leaves may be red in the fall.
Western poison ivy is typically a low shrub with three leaves that does not form a climbing vine.
It may have yellow or green flowers and white to green-yellow or amber berries.
Poison Oak
Poison oak: Photos courtesy of U.S. Department of Agriculture
Poison oak is typically a shrub with three leaves, like poison ivy.
Pacific poison oak may be vine-like.
It may have yellow or green flowers and clusters of green-yellow or white berries.
Poison Sumac
Poison sumac: Photos courtesy of U.S. Department of Agriculture
Poison sumac is a woody shrub that has stems with 7–13 leaves arranged in pairs.
It may have glossy, pale yellow, or cream-colored berries.
Symptoms
Symptoms of contact with poisonous plants include:
Red rash within a few days of skin contact
Bumps, red patches or streaking, or weeping blisters
Note: fluids in blisters will not cause blisters to spread on you or others
Swelling
Itching
Types of Exposure
Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac release an oil (urushiol) when part of the plant is damaged or burned. When the oil gets on the skin, most exposed people have an allergic reaction (contact dermatitis). Workers can become exposed to urushiol through:
Direct contact with the plant.
Indirect contact, such as touching tools, livestock, or clothing that have urushiol on them.
Inhaling particles containing urushiol from burning plants.
Exposure to an amount of urushiol less than a grain of salt causes a rash in 80-90 percent of adults. The rash may significantly impede or prevent a person from working. Burning these poisonous plants can be very dangerous because the allergens can irritate lungs.
Reducing risk
What employers can do
Employers can protect their workers from poisonous plants by training them about:
Their risk of exposure to poisonous plants.
How to identify poisonous plants.
How to prevent exposure to poisonous plants.
What they should do if they are exposed to poisonous plants.
What workers can do
Wear long sleeves, long pants, boots, and gloves. Wash exposed clothing separately in hot water with detergent.
Use barrier skin creams, such as a lotion containing bentoquatam which may offer some protection before contact. Barrier creams should be washed off and reapplied twice a day.
Clean tools with rubbing alcohol (isopropanol or isopropyl alcohol) or soap and lots of water. Urushiol can remain active on the surface of objects for up to 5 years. Wear disposable gloves while cleaning.
Do not burn plants that may be poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac. Inhaling smoke from burning plants can cause severe allergic respiratory problems.
When burning poisonous plants
Employers should prevent workers from being exposed to burning poisonous plants whenever possible. When exposure to burning poisonous plants is unavoidable, employers should provide workers with a NIOSH-certified half-face piece particulate respirator.
Respirators should be rated R–95, P–95, or better. Firefighters may require a higher level of respiratory protection to protect against possible exposure to combustion products.
Respirators should protect against exposure to burning poisonous plants. However, they will not protect against all products in smoke, such as carbon monoxide.
Respirators must be worn correctly and consistently throughout the time they are used. For respirators to be effective there must be a tight seal between the user’s face and the respirator.
Employers must have a written comprehensive respiratory protection program if workers use respirators (see OSHA Respiratory Protection standard 29 CFR 1910.134
).
First Aid
Rinse skin immediately.
Use rubbing alcohol, poison plant washes, or dishwashing soap, and lots of water.
Rinse often to prevent wash solutions from drying on the skin and further spreading the urushiol.
Scrub under nails with a brush.
Apply wet compresses, calamine lotion, or hydrocortisone cream to the skin to reduce itching and blistering.
Follow the directions on any creams or lotions.
Do not apply creams or lotions to broken skin.
Oatmeal baths may relieve itching.
Take an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (like Benadryl) to help relieve itching.
Follow directions on the package.
Antihistamines may make you drowsy.
If children touch contaminated work clothing, contact a pediatrician.
Get medical help in severe cases, or if the rash is on the face or genitals.
Call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room if you or another worker:
Has a severe allergic reaction, like swelling or difficulty breathing.
Has had a severe reaction to poisonous plants in the past.

Polio Vaccination
KEY POINTS
There is no cure for polio (or poliomyelitis), but it can be prevented with safe and effective vaccination.
CDC recommends that children get 4 doses of polio vaccine to protect them against severe polio disease, including paralysis.
Most adults in the United States were vaccinated as children and are therefore likely to be protected from getting polio.
Introduction
The best way to protect against polio, or poliomyelitis, is to get vaccinated. Polio vaccination has been part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in the United States for decades. It's still part of the routine childhood immunization schedule.
Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is the only polio vaccine that has been given in the United States since 2000. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is used in other countries.
Available vaccines
There are two types of vaccines that protect against polio.
Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)
The only polio vaccine that has been used in the United States since 2000.
It is given by shot in the leg or arm, depending on the patient's age.
Oral polio vaccine (OPV)
No longer licensed or available in the United States
It is still used in many parts of the world.
Children receive doses of the vaccine by drops in the mouth.
Since 2000, only IPV has been used to eliminate the risk of polio variants that can occur with OPV
.
Recommendations
As part of routine childhood immunization, children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. IPV may sometimes be given in the same shot with other vaccines (also called combination vaccines). You can ask your child's doctor about this option.
Children should get 4 doses total, one at each of the following ages:
2 months old
1st dose
4 months old
2nd dose
6–18 months old
3rd dose
4–6 years old
4th dose
Children who are delayed in getting all recommended doses should finish their series by following the recommended catch-up schedule.
Most adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you have never been vaccinated against polio you should get 3 doses of IPV:
The first dose at any time
The second dose 1 to 2 months later
The third dose 6 to 12 months after the second
Anyone not fully vaccinated. If you have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine before, you should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses.
People at risk. If you are fully vaccinated but at increased risk of poliovirus exposure, you may receive 1 lifetime booster dose of IPV.
If you plan to travel outside the U.S.
People who will be traveling to a country where the risk of getting polio is greater should be vaccinated against polio well before leaving for their trip. If a child cannot complete the routine series before leaving, a polio accelerated schedule is recommended.
Vaccines for International Travelers
Why getting vaccinated is important
Polio vaccination protects you child from:
Getting polio, a potentially serious disease.
Developing lifelong paralysis from polio.
The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can later develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults. This can occur 15 to 40 years later.
About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die. This is because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.
Polio can be brought into the U.S.
Thanks to a successful vaccination program, most people in the United States are protected from polio. However, people who are not vaccinated or who haven't received all recommended doses may be at risk of getting polio. The disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It only takes one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio into the United States.
Who should get vaccinated
Infants and children
As part of routine childhood immunization, all children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. This includes children who have not started their polio vaccine series or who are delayed in getting all recommended doses. People who plan to travel internationally should make sure they and their children are fully vaccinated against polio before departure.
Adults
Most adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you know or suspect that you are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated you should receive polio vaccination.
Situations that put adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus include:
You are traveling to a country where there is a documented increased risk of exposure to poliovirus. Ask your healthcare provider if you need to be vaccinated.
You are working in a laboratory or healthcare setting and handling specimens that might contain polioviruses.
You are a healthcare worker or caregiver who has close contact with a person who could be infected with poliovirus.
Public health authorities have identified you as being part of a group or population at increased risk of exposure because of an outbreak.
Who shouldn't get vaccinated
Check with your healthcare provider if your child has:
A severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of IPV.
A severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of IPV. Ask your health care provider if you want information about vaccine components.
People who are moderately or severely ill should wait to get the vaccine until they recover. These include infants with moderate or severe diarrhea or vomiting. If you have a mild illness, such as a cold, they can probably get the vaccine today.
The vaccine is safe and effective
IPV protects against severe disease caused by poliovirus in almost everyone who has received all the recommended doses.
Two doses of IPV provide at least 90% protection.
Three doses of IPV provide at least 99% protection.
Possible side effects
There is a chance of side effects, but they are usually mild and go away on their own. Serious reactions are also possible.
Some people get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people do not have any problems with it.
Some problems that could happen after getting this vaccine:
People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your healthcare provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears after you get the shot.
Some people get more severe and lasting shoulder pain than the typical soreness that can follow injections. This happens very rarely.
Finding and paying for the vaccine
Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers.

Where to Find Vaccines
Vaccine costs
There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines:
Health insurance
Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children Program
Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines.
Common questions
What are the childcare & school vaccine requirements?
All 50 states and DC have state laws that require children entering childcare or public schools to have certain vaccinations. There is no federal law that requires this. CDC recommends that all children get 4 doses of IPV before or at school entry.
Students in school settings have a higher likelihood of spreading chickenpox because they are constantly in close contact with each other. Getting vaccinated means:
Less illness and less school time missed by students.
Less chance of exposing people who cannot get vaccinated.

It is still used in many parts of the world.
Children receive doses of the vaccine by drops in the mouth.
Since 2000, only IPV has been used to eliminate the risk of polio variants that can occur with OPV
.
Recommendations
As part of routine childhood immunization, children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. IPV may sometimes be given in the same shot with other vaccines (also called combination vaccines). You can ask your child's doctor about this option.
Children should get 4 doses total, one at each of the following ages:
2 months old
1st dose
4 months old
2nd dose
6–18 months old
3rd dose
4–6 years old
4th dose
Children who are delayed in getting all recommended doses should finish their series by following the recommended catch-up schedule.
Most adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you have never been vaccinated against polio you should get 3 doses of IPV:
The first dose at any time
The second dose 1 to 2 months later
The third dose 6 to 12 months after the second
Anyone not fully vaccinated. If you have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine before, you should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses.
People at risk. If you are fully vaccinated but at increased risk of poliovirus exposure, you may receive 1 lifetime booster dose of IPV.
If you plan to travel outside the U.S.
People who will be traveling to a country where the risk of getting polio is greater should be vaccinated against polio well before leaving for their trip. If a child cannot complete the routine series before leaving, a polio accelerated schedule is recommended.
Vaccines for International Travelers
Why getting vaccinated is important
Polio vaccination protects you child from:
Getting polio, a potentially serious disease.
Developing lifelong paralysis from polio.
The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can later develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults. This can occur 15 to 40 years later.
About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die. This is because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.
Polio can be brought into the U.S.
Thanks to a successful vaccination program, most people in the United States are protected from polio. However, people who are not vaccinated or who haven't received all recommended doses may be at risk of getting polio. The disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It only takes one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio into the United States.
Who should get vaccinated
Infants and children
As part of routine childhood immunization, all children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. This includes children who have not started their polio vaccine series or who are delayed in getting all recommended doses. People who plan to travel internationally should make sure they and their children are fully vaccinated against polio before departure.
Adults
Most adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you know or suspect that you are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated you should receive polio vaccination.
Situations that put adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus include:
You are traveling to a country where there is a documented increased risk of exposure to poliovirus. Ask your healthcare provider if you need to be vaccinated.
You are working in a laboratory or healthcare setting and handling specimens that might contain polioviruses.
You are a healthcare worker or caregiver who has close contact with a person who could be infected with poliovirus.
Public health authorities have identified you as being part of a group or population at increased risk of exposure because of an outbreak.
Who shouldn't get vaccinated
Check with your healthcare provider if your child has:
A severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of IPV.
A severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of IPV. Ask your health care provider if you want information about vaccine components.
People who are moderately or severely ill should wait to get the vaccine until they recover. These include infants with moderate or severe diarrhea or vomiting. If you have a mild illness, such as a cold, they can probably get the vaccine today.
The vaccine is safe and effective
IPV protects against severe disease caused by poliovirus in almost everyone who has received all the recommended doses.
Two doses of IPV provide at least 90% protection.
Three doses of IPV provide at least 99% protection.
Possible side effects
There is a chance of side effects, but they are usually mild and go away on their own. Serious reactions are also possible.
Some people get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people do not have any problems with it.
Some problems that could happen after getting this vaccine:
People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your healthcare provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears after you get the shot.
Some people get more severe and lasting shoulder pain than the typical soreness that can follow injections. This happens very rarely.
Finding and paying for the vaccine
Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers.

Where to Find Vaccines
Vaccine costs
There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines:
Health insurance
Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children Program
Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines.
Common questions
What are the childcare & school vaccine requirements?
All 50 states and DC have state laws that require children entering childcare or public schools to have certain vaccinations. There is no federal law that requires this. CDC recommends that all children get 4 doses of IPV before or at school entry.
Students in school settings have a higher likelihood of spreading chickenpox because they are constantly in close contact with each other. Getting vaccinated means:
Less illness and less school time missed by students.
Less chance of exposing people who cannot get vaccinated.

Chemical Emergencies
Cyanide
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Cyanide is a fast acting and potentially deadly chemical.
Signs and symptoms of ammonia exposure depend on how much you were exposed to.
Get away from the area, get clean, and get medical care if exposed.
Background
Cyanide is a fast acting and potentially deadly chemical that affects the body's ability to use oxygen.
It comes from natural substances in some foods and in certain plants, including the pits and seeds of some common fruits.
Cyanide is sometimes described as having a ""bitter almond"" smell. It does not always give off a smell, and not everyone can smell it.
Types
Gas or liquid
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) - also known as ""AC"" in the military
Cyanogen chloride (CNCI) - also known as ""CK"" in the military
Solid (crystal)
Sodium cyanide (NaCN)
Potassium cyanide (KCN)
Uses of cyanide
Making paper, textiles and plastics
Developing photographs
Metallurgy
Includes electroplating, metal cleaning and removing gold from its ore
Killing pests and vermin
Signs and symptoms
Breathing in cyanide gas causes symptoms to show up the fastest, but swallowing solid or liquid cyanide can be dangerous too.
These symptoms can happen during or right after someone is exposed:
Chest pain and/or chest tightness
Dizziness, weakness, and/or confusion
Eye pain and/or eye tearing
Excitement
Restlessness
Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath or wheezing
Rapid or slow breathing
Rapid or slow heart rate
Headache
Nausea and/or vomiting
If exposed to large amounts, signs and symptoms include:
Coma
Death
High or low blood pressure
Loss of consciousness
Lung injury
Seizures
These symptoms can happen very quickly when exposed to a large amount of cyanide. These symptoms can happen with any type of exposure (breathing in, skin or eye contact, or swallowing).
Exposure
Water
If cyanide is in the water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the water.
Air
If cyanide is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the cyanide gas. If solid cyanide is put into water, it can make hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN or AC). This can increase chances of breathing in the gas.
Cyanide gas is most dangerous in enclosed places where gas will be trapped. Cyanide gas can spread quickly in open spaces depending on the weather. less harmful outdoors.
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN or AC) gas is lighter than air, so the gas will rise. Cyanogen Chloride (CNCl or CK) is heavier and will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there.
Cyanide in food
Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with cyanide can expose people to cyanide. This is more likely to happen with solid cyanide.
Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched liquid cyanide if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an cyanide release. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the cyanide was released and breathe fresh air.
If the cyanide release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the cyanide does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the cyanide was released.
If the cyanide release was indoors, get out of the building.
Resource
Make sure you understand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency broadcasts and local authorities for instructions.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. Showering is the best method for removing cyanide from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take your clothes off
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will prevent the cyanide from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
If you were exposed to solid cyanide, skip this step and wash your body as described in the next section.
If you were exposed to any form except solid cyanide, follow these steps to blot your body:
Use dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Use a different cloth or towel for each body part.
Start blotting with your head and hair.
Then blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds.
Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch cyanide. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.
Get help
To get help right away:
Call 911.
Go to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave.
Call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.
Treatment
The most important thing is for people to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.
If someone has swallowed cyanide, do not force vomiting.
Cyanide poisoning is treated with specific antidotes (treatment to reduce the effects of poison). Antidotes for cyanide poisoning are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.
It is also treated with supportive medical care in a hospital or by trained emergency personnel.
Long-term health effects
Survivors of large amounts of cyanide exposure may develop heart, brain, and nerve damage.
Powassan Virus
About Powassan
KEY POINTS
Powassan virus is spread to people by the bite of an infected tick.
Powassan virus disease is rare but is increasing.
Initial symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, and weakness.
There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat Powassan virus disease.
Reduce your risk by avoiding ticks.
Overview
Powassan virus is spread to people by the bite of an infected tick. Although still rare, the number of reported cases of people sick from Powassan virus has increased in recent years. Most cases in the United States occur in the northeast and Great Lakes regions from late spring through mid-fall when ticks are most active.
Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and weakness. Powassan virus can cause severe disease, including inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Symptoms of severe disease include confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, and seizures.
There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat Powassan virus disease. Reduce your risk of infection from Powassan virus by avoiding ticks.

Precision Health: Predict and Prevent Disease
KEY POINTS
Your genes, behaviors (such as exercise and eating habits), and environment are all factors that affect your health.
The goal of precision health is to protect your health by measuring these factors and acting on them.
Interventions can be tailored to you, rather than using the same approach for everyone.
Precision health approaches can improve prediction and prevention of diseases.
What it is
You might have heard the terms ""precision medicine"" and ""precision health"" and wondered how they relate to you. Precision medicine, also called personalized medicine, helps your healthcare provider find your unique disease risks and treatments that will work best for you. Precision health is broader—it includes precision medicine but also includes approaches that occur outside the setting of a healthcare provider's office or hospital, such as disease prevention and health promotion activities. Precision health involves steps that everyone can take on their own to protect their health, as well as steps that public health professionals can take (sometimes called precision public health).
How it works
Let's explore how precision health approaches can improve prediction and prevention of diseases.
Family health history can help you know which diseases you are more likely to get: Having family members with certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or cancer, can sometimes mean you are more likely to get that disease. Collecting your family health history and sharing it with your healthcare provider can help you take steps to prevent disease or find it early. In some cases, your healthcare provider might recommend genetic counseling and testing for a disease that runs in your family.
EXAMPLE: When talking about your family health history, your healthcare provider asks if anyone in your family has had breast cancer. You mention that your mother was diagnosed at age 51. Your healthcare provider tells you that having a parent or sibling with breast cancer makes you more likely to get breast cancer. Therefore, they stress to you the importance of following current guidelines
and getting a yearly mammogram, starting at age 40.
Personal devices can keep track of your health information: Mobile health applications on your smart device are an easy way to track information, such as nutrition, physical activity, and blood pressure. Measurements are taken in real time and can inform you of progress and even alert you to changes that could mean you need to seek medical care, although these devices are not a replacement for regular checkups.
EXAMPLE: Joe, an active 49-year-old man with no history of heart problems, got an alert on his smartphone that he had atrial fibrillation (also called AFib). He went to a nearby urgent care center, where healthcare providers confirmed that he had the condition. Left untreated, atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke. By finding out about his atrial fibrillation early, Joe could take steps to treat it before he had any serious health problems.
Social media can help public health workers track disease and communicate health information: Public health researchers are exploring how social media could be used to help track disease outbreaks, for example by looking for posts that self-report symptoms of a disease. Health departments can use social media to communicate important health information to a large audience.
EXAMPLE: Your state health department posts a message on social media in response to seeing an increase in the number of flu cases. The post details how to prevent the flu, what to do if you think you have it, and who is most at risk for complications. You've been busy and haven't had time to get a flu shot, but seeing this post encourages you to get one the next day.
Genome sequencing can help find, track and control infectious disease outbreaks: The type of germ that's making people sick can be identified using genome sequencing, which shows the DNA fingerprint of the germ. Healthcare providers and public health officials then can more easily find out which people's illnesses are caused by the germ. Knowing exactly which germ is making their patients sick can help healthcare providers determine the treatment that will work best. Public health workers can more accurately track the germ and find its source.
EXAMPLE: After eating at a restaurant, you and your friend have symptoms of food poisoning. You are seen by your healthcare provider, who orders tests of your stool. When Salmonella bacteria are identified in your stool, your healthcare provider alerts the health department. The health department then performs genetic testing on the Salmonella bacteria from your stool sample and determines that they are from a strain that matches that of several other confirmed cases in your area, all of whom reported eating papayas. Using this information, public health workers then find the source is a certain brand of papayas and remove them from grocery stores and restaurants, thereby preventing additional cases.
Newborn screening can find medical conditions early to prevent complications: Babies born in the United States are checked for certain medical conditions soon after birth. This is called newborn screening, which includes a blood test and screenings for hearing loss and heart defects. Newborn screening can prevent disability or death by identifying conditions and treating them sooner.
EXAMPLE: Through newborn screening, a baby is diagnosed with a type of primary immunodeficiency called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) soon after she is born. Babies with SCID can die without treatment because their bodies cannot fight infections.
Medical options can prevent disease in people with inherited conditions: Some people have inherited conditions that make them more likely to get a disease. Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic change are more likely to get breast or ovarian cancer, and men with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic change have an increased risk for some cancers as well. People with Lynch syndrome are more likely to get colorectal (colon) and other cancers. People with familial hypercholesterolemia are more likely to develop heart disease at a younger age and to die from the disease. However, if you have one of these inherited conditions, knowing about it can allow you to take steps to prevent the cancer or heart disease or find it early. Medical options can include screening earlier or more often, taking medicine, or having surgery.
EXAMPLE: Roger has a family health history of Lynch syndrome. He decides to have genetic testing for the Lynch syndrome genetic change that his family members have. If testing shows that he has the genetic change, he can take steps to prevent cancer and find it early if it develops, including starting yearly colonoscopy screening tests early.
What you can do
To fulfill the promise of precision health, much more research is needed. The All of Us Research Program,
led by the National Institutes of Health,
has begun enrolling participants and plans to enroll one million or more U.S. participants. All of Us participants will be followed for several years. They answer surveys on different topics and share their electronic health records. Participants may provide blood, urine, or saliva (spit) samples for lab and DNA tests. All health information is stored in a secure database.
All of Us researchers are using this information to look at how genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors can affect health, including likelihood of getting certain diseases and effectiveness of interventions. Having a wide variety of participants for this study is important to make sure it benefits everyone—learn more.

Pregnancy and HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STDs, & Tuberculosis Prevention
HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD & Tuberculosis Prevention in Pregnancy
KEY POINTS
Infections with HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, and TB can complicate pregnancy and may have serious consequences for a woman, her pregnancy outcomes, and her baby.
Screening and treatment for these infections, and vaccinations against viruses can prevent many bad outcomes.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
Infection with HIV, viral hepatitis or STIs can affect the wellbeing of the mother, the pregnancy outcome, and child.
Screening and treatment for these infections, and vaccinations against viruses, such as hepatitis B and human papillomavirus, can prevent many bad outcomes.
Screening for infections is the first step in accessing the care and treatment needed to prevent transmission of the infection to the infant and to improve the mother's health. Prenatal screening for some infections (HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus) is recommended for all pregnant women. Screening for other infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, and TB) is recommended for some women at risk for infection.
For additional information on screening for women at higher risk for STIs, visit STDs during Pregnancy – CDC Fact Sheet (Detailed)
For information about TB diagnosis during pregnancy, visit TB and Pregnancy.
Prevention tips
To protect all women and infants, CDC recommends the following:
Hepatitis B Virus Infection (HBV)
All pregnant women should be screened during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing. Pregnant women with a history of appropriately timed triple panel screening and without subsequent risk for exposure to HBV (i.e., no new HBV exposures since triple panel screening) only need hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening. Testing pregnant women known to be chronically infected or immune enables documentation of the HBsAg test result during that pregnancy to ensure timely prophylaxis for exposed infants. Newborns of pregnant women who are HBsAg positive should receive the HepB vaccine and HepB immune globulin at birth and complete the HepB vaccine series according to the recommended vaccination schedule.
Hepatitis C Virus Infection (HCV)
All pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis C during each pregnancy. While there is no treatment available to prevent transmission of HCV infection from mother to child, screening for HCV infection during pregnancy allows health care providers to identify infected women who should receive treatment during the postpartum period and infants who should receive testing during a pediatric visit. Identification of HCV infection during pregnancy also can inform pregnancy and delivery management issues that might reduce the risk of HCV transmission to the infant.
HIV
All pregnant women should be tested for HIV as early as possible, preferably at the first prenatal visit. The earlier HIV is diagnosed and treated, the more effective HIV medicines — called antiretroviral therapy or ART — can be at preventing transmission and improving the health outcomes of both mother and child.
Syphilis
All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, ideally during the first trimester of pregnancy. Among women who may be less likely to receive prenatal care, consider testing at the time of pregnancy testing. The earlier syphilis is diagnosed and treated during pregnancy, the more likely congenital syphilis and its complications (such as stillbirth) can be prevented in the infant. Penicillin G is effective for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus, as well as treating fetal and maternal infection. Pregnant women who live in communities with high rates of syphilis, who are at high risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., substance use or a new sex partner), or who were not previously tested during the pregnancy should also be screened again at 28 weeks and at delivery.
Tuberculosis (TB)
Healthcare providers should assess all persons, including pregnant women, for risk factors associated with latent TB infection and TB disease. While universal testing for latent TB infection and TB disease is not recommended for pregnant women in the United States, targeted testing for those with risk factors, including people living with HIV infection, people born in high TB prevalence countries, and those who are known contacts of persons with TB disease, facilitates prompt initiation of curative treatment for those with TB disease.
Pregnancy and Vaccination
About Vaccines and Pregnancy
PURPOSE
Getting vaccinated while you’re pregnant helps your body create protective antibodies you can pass on to your baby. These antibodies can help protect your baby from those diseases during the first few months of life.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Things to Know
1. You aren't just protecting yourself—vaccines during pregnancy give your baby some early protection too!
Did you know a baby can get some disease protection from their mom during pregnancy? Getting flu, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19 vaccines while you're pregnant helps your body create protective antibodies (proteins produced by the body to fight off diseases), and you can pass on those antibodies to your baby. These antibodies can help protect your baby from those diseases during the first few months of life.
Vaccines during pregnancy give your baby some early protection too.
2. Flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccination while pregnant can help keep you and your little one safe.
CDC and a panel of experts who make vaccine recommendations have concluded that flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant women and their babies. These experts carefully reviewed the available safety data before recommending any vaccines during pregnancy.
Vaccines, like medicine, can have side effects. But most people who get vaccinated have mild or no side effects. CDC continually monitors vaccine safety, and the most common side effects of these vaccines include fever, tiredness, and body aches, as well as redness, swelling, and tenderness at the site where the shot was given.
Flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant women and their babies.
3. The Tdap vaccine helps protect against whooping cough, which can be really dangerous for your baby.
You'll need a Tdap vaccine during your pregnancy, with optimal timing between the 27th through 36th week of each pregnancy, preferably during the earlier part of this time period. Tdap helps protect against whooping cough (pertussis), which can be life-threatening for newborns.
About half of babies younger than 1 year old who get whooping cough need treatment in the hospital. The younger a baby is when they get whooping cough, the more likely the baby will need to be treated in a hospital. While some babies cough a lot, other babies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead, it can cause them to stop breathing and turn blue. Siblings, parents, or caregivers who don't know they have whooping cough can infect babies since the disease often causes only mild symptoms in older children and adults.
Tdap helps protect against whooping cough (pertussis), which can be life-threatening for newborns.
4. Getting a flu vaccine while pregnant can help protect you and your baby against flu.
Changes in your immune, heart, and lung functions during pregnancy make you more likely to get seriously ill from flu. Pregnancy increases the risk of being hospitalized with the flu and having flu-related complications if you get sick with the flu. Flu may also be dangerous for your pregnancy. Fever during pregnancy, for any reason, has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Additionally, babies are more likely to get very sick from flu. Flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. When you get a flu vaccine during pregnancy, you pass antibodies along to your baby that can help protect them from flu in the first few months after they're born, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves.
Get a flu shot if you are pregnant during flu season—it's the best way to protect yourself and your baby from flu. Flu vaccine is safe during pregnancy and can be given during any trimester.
When you get a flu vaccine during pregnancy, you pass antibodies along to your baby that can help protect them from flu in the first few months after they're born.
5. Getting an RSV vaccine during your pregnancy or getting your baby an RSV immunization can help protect your baby
RSV is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants. Babies infected with RSV can have difficulty breathing and eating and sometimes may need respiratory support or hydration in the hospital. There are two ways to protect your baby from getting very sick with RSV. You can choose to get RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of your pregnancy during September to January, or your baby aged 8 months or younger can get RSV immunization during their first RSV season.
Getting an RSV vaccine during your pregnancy or getting your baby an RSV immunization can help protect your baby.
6. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant can help protect you and your baby from getting very sick from COVID-19.
If you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 than women who are not pregnant. Additionally, if you have COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are more likely to have complications that can affect your pregnancy and developing baby.
COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, including women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future. Evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe and effective and suggests that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential risks. New data show that vaccination during pregnancy can help protect babies younger than 6 months old, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves, from hospitalization due to COVID-19.
Everyone, including women who are pregnant, should stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines, including getting an updated vaccine when it's time to get one.
COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, including women who are pregnant or might become pregnant in the future.
7. Timing of vaccinations is everything!
You know all about timing. Week after week, you are tracking your baby's growth and development and counting down the days until you meet your little one! When it comes to vaccines, timing is also important.
Flu seasons vary in their timing from season to season. For most people, CDC recommends getting the flu vaccine in September or October to ensure that they are protected before flu activity begins to increase. Early vaccination during July and August also can be considered for women who are in the third trimester of pregnancy during those months.
Instead of during a specific time of year, CDC recommends you get your Tdap vaccine in each pregnancy, ideally between the 27th and 36th week. Getting Tdap during this period preferably during the earlier part, helps pass the greatest amount of protective antibodies to your baby before birth. This will help protect your baby during their first few months of life when they are most vulnerable to serious disease and complications.
You can get your RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy during September to January, or your baby aged 8 months or younger can get RSV immunization during their first RSV season.
You can get your updated COVID-19 vaccine at any point in pregnancy.
When it comes to vaccines, timing is important.
8. Anyone who is around your baby needs vaccines too.
Newborns do not yet have fully developed immune systems, making them particularly vulnerable to infections. Older kids and adults can spread viruses to babies, even if they don't feel very sick. Because of this, anyone who is around babies should be up to date on all recommended vaccines. This includes parents, siblings, and any other caregivers, like grandparents, or babysitters. Anyone who needs vaccines should get them at least two weeks before meeting the baby because it takes about two weeks to develop antibodies after vaccination.
Anyone who is around babies should be up to date on all recommended vaccines.
9. If you get pregnant again, you'll need a Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy.
The amount of antibodies you have in your body after getting vaccinated decreases over time. When you get a vaccine during one pregnancy, your antibody levels may not stay high enough to provide enough protection during future pregnancies, even if your babies are close in age. So, make sure you give baby number 2 (and 3 and 4…) the greatest amount of protective antibodies and the best disease protection possible by getting your Tdap vaccine each time you are pregnant. You should also get a flu shot every flu season, and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.
You'll need a Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy.

About Teen Pregnancy
KEY POINTS
US teen birth rates have continued to decline since 1991.
Although US teen births are declining, the US teen birth rate is higher than in many other high-income countries.
US teen birth rates vary among different racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic groups.
Overview
The US teen birth rate (births per 1,000 females aged 15-19 years) has declined 78% from 1991 to 2021.
Teen birth rates declined from 15 births per 1,000 females in 2020 to 14 births per 1,000 females in 2021. This is a record low and a decrease of 7% from 2020.1
Reasons for the declines are not totally clear. Evidence suggests these declines are due to more teens abstaining from sexual activity, and more sexually active teens using birth control.2
Although steadily declining, the US teen birth rate is higher than in other high-income countries.3 Additionally, rates vary among different racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic groups.14
What the data show
Racial and ethnic disparities
The 2021 teen birth rates (births per 1,000 females aged 15-19)1 varied by race and ethnicity:
24 for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native females.
22 for non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander females.
22 for non-Hispanic Black females.
21 for Hispanic females.
9 for non-Hispanic White females.
2 for non-Hispanic Asian females.
Geographic and socioeconomic disparities
Geographic differences in teen birth rates persist, both within and across states.4
Teens in certain settings are at higher risk of teen pregnancy and birth than other groups. For example, women ever in foster care were more likely to have a teen birth than women who had never been in foster care.5
Social determinants of health (Healthy People 2030
)—such as community levels of high unemployment, low education, and low income—have been associated with higher teen birth rates.
Interventions that address socioeconomic conditions like these may play a critical role in addressing disparities observed in US teen birth rates.6
What CDC is doing
Quality sexual and reproductive health services, such as birth control and sexually transmitted infection services, are important for supporting adolescent health. However, best practice recommendations for these services are not always followed.
CDC supports the Quality and Access for Reproductive Health Equity (QARE, pronounced 'care') for Teens project. This project is led by the National Association of Community Health Centers, along with Cicatelli Associates (CAI). It aims to improve best practices in health center services and increase access to those services.
Maternal Infant Health
Preterm Birth
AT A GLANCE
Preterm birth is when a baby is born too early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy have been completed. In 2022, preterm birth affected about 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States.
Preterm birth rates
The preterm birth rate declined 1% from 2021 to 2022, to 10.4%, following an increase of 4% from 2020 to 2021. However, racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth rates remain. In 2022, preterm birth among Black women (14.6%) was about 50% higher than White (9.4%) or Hispanic women (10.1%).
Health problems related to preterm birth
Important growth happens throughout pregnancy─ including in the final months and weeks. For example, the brain, lungs, and liver need the final weeks of pregnancy to fully develop. Unless there is a medical need, delivery should not be scheduled before 39 weeks of pregnancy.
Babies born too early (especially before 32 weeks) have higher rates of death and disability. In 2022, preterm birth and low birth weight accounted for about 14.0% of infant deaths (deaths before 1 year of age). Babies who survive may have breathing problems, feeding difficulties, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, vision problems
, and hearing problems. Preterm births may also take an emotional toll and be a financial burden for families.
What to do if you're experiencing preterm labor
Preterm labor is labor that happens too soon, before 37 weeks of pregnancy. If you think you are experiencing signs of preterm labor
, see a health care provider right away. Your provider may be able to give you medicine so that the baby will be healthier at birth.
Factors associated with preterm birth
Many times we do not know what causes women to deliver their babies early. Several factors may increase the likelihood that a woman could deliver early.1 Below are groups with higher rates of preterm birth.
Demographic or social characteristics
Teens.
Women who become pregnant over age 35.
Black women.*
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women.*
American Indian or Alaska Native women.*
Women with lower incomes.
Women experiencing stress.
Pregnancy and medical conditions
Women who have had a prior preterm birth.
Women with an infection, including COVID-19.
Women carrying more than 1 baby (twins, triplets, or more).
Women with high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy.
Behavioral characteristics
Women who use tobacco.
Women who use drugs.
*Race is used to describe and categorize groups of people by physical characteristics such as skin color or lineage. It is not a biological driver of differences in preterm birth.
Talk with your doctor about signs of preterm labor and what to do.
Preventing preterm birth
Preventing preterm birth remains a challenge because causes may not always be well understood. However, pregnant women can take important steps to help reduce their risk of preterm birth and improve their general health:
Quit smoking. For help quitting, see How to Quit Smoking.
Avoid alcohol and drugs.
Get prenatal care early and throughout pregnancy.
Seek medical attention for any signs or symptoms of preterm labor.
Talk with your doctor if you had a previous preterm birth.
Another step women and their partners can take to reduce the risk is to wait at least 18 months between pregnancies
.
Risk of preterm birth after conceiving using IVF
Women who conceive through in vitro fertilization (IVF) or another assisted reproductive technology (ART) are at higher risk for preterm birth. This is primarily because they are more likely to be pregnant with more than one baby at a time.
CDC activities
Perinatal Quality Collaboratives
CDC's Division of Reproductive Health recently expanded support to 36 Perinatal Quality Collaboratives (PQCs). Funding supports the capabilities of PQCs to improve the quality of perinatal care in their states. This includes efforts to reduce preterm birth.

Recommended Vaccines for Preteens and Teens
KEY POINTS
CDC recommends meningococcal vaccination for all preteens and teens.
Talk to a healthcare or vaccine provider about meningococcal vaccination to help protect your child's health.
Vaccines your teen may need
View LargerDownload
Teens and young adults now have 3 meningococcal vaccine options.
There are 3 types of meningococcal vaccines used in the United States. Each type helps protect against different serogroups (strains) of meningococcal bacteria.
Meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccines
Protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y
Serogroup B meningococcal or MenB vaccines
Protect against serogroup B
Pentavalent or MenABCWY vaccine
Protects against serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y
Keep Reading:
Meningococcal Vaccination
Recommendations by vaccine type
MenACWY vaccines
All preteens (11 to 12 year olds) should get a MenACWY vaccine. Since protection decreases over time, CDC recommends a booster shot at 16 years old. The booster shot provides protection during the ages when teens are at highest risk of meningococcal disease.
Many colleges require proof of MenACWY vaccination within 5 years before starting school. Regardless of school requirements, CDC recommends a booster for all teens who received the first shot before their 16th birthday. Teens who receive their first MenACWY shot at or after age 16 years don't need a booster.
MenB vaccines
Teens may get a MenB vaccine, preferably at 16 through 18 years old.
While any teen may choose to get a MenB vaccine, certain preteens and teens should get it. CDC recommends MenB vaccines for preteens and teens with the following risk factors:
A complement component deficiency
Functional or anatomic asplenia
An inhibited complement system due to receiving certain medicines
Part of a population at increased risk during an outbreakA
MenABCWY vaccine as an option
Preteens and teens who are getting MenACWY and MenB vaccines at the same visit can receive MenABCWY vaccine instead. If a MenABCWY vaccine isn't available, MenACWY and MenB vaccines can be given as two separate shots, preferably in different arms.
MenB considerations
Serogroup B meningococcal disease is relatively rare. Outbreaks have occurred at several U.S. colleges during the past decade. CDC's current recommendation gives people access to MenB vaccines to help prevent this uncommon, but serious illness.
However, healthcare providers and parents should discuss the risk of the disease and weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination. Available data suggest these vaccines safely provide protection, but that protection decreases fairly quickly after vaccination.
Learn more about how well meningococcal vaccines work.
Brand considerations
CDC has no preference as to which brand of meningococcal vaccine anyone receives.
However, it's important to note that both MenB vaccine brands require multiple shots for maximum protection. People must get the same MenB vaccine brand for all shots. MenABCWY vaccine includes the MenB vaccine Trumenba®. If someone receives MenABCWY vaccine, then they need to get Trumenba® for their second MenB shot.
Safety and side effects
Meningococcal vaccines safely provide protection. Like with medicines, there is a chance of side effects with vaccines. Learn more about the possible side effects of meningococcal vaccines.
Teens are more likely to have side effects after MenB vaccination compared to other vaccines given to preteens and teens. Those other vaccines include HPV, MenACWY, and Tdap vaccines.
CDC continually monitors the safety of all vaccines. For more information, view the vaccine information statements:

Influenza (Flu)
Preventing Seasonal Flu
HIGHLIGHTS
The best way to reduce your risk from seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications is to get a flu vaccine every year. This page has resources to help answer your questions about flu vaccines.
Prevention steps and strategies
Take time to get a flu vaccine.
Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season, especially people at higher risk.
CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important action in reducing your risk of flu and its potentially serious outcomes.
Flu vaccines help to reduce the burden of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths on the health care system each year. (Read more about flu vaccine benefits.)
Flu vaccination also has been shown to reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.
For 2024-2025, all flu vaccines will be designed to protect against three influenza viruses (Visit Vaccine Virus Selection for this season's vaccine composition.)
Everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October but people should continue to get vaccinated as long as flu viruses pose a threat to their community.
Vaccination of people at higher risk of developing serious flu complications is especially important to decrease their risk of severe flu illness.
People at higher risk of serious flu complications include young children, pregnant women, people with certain chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart and lung disease, and people 65 years and older.
Vaccination also is important for health care workers and other people who live with or care for people at higher risk of serious flu illness to keep from spreading flu to them. This is especially true for people who work in long-term care facilities, which are home to many of the people most vulnerable to flu.
Children younger than 6 months are at higher risk of serious flu illness but are too young to be vaccinated. People who care for infants should be vaccinated instead.
Take everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs.
Take actions every day to help stop the spread of germs. Getting a flu vaccine is the most important.
Take other preventive actions in addition to vaccination that may help reduce the spread of viruses like flu.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. For flu, CDC recommends that people stay home, for at least 24 hours, until both are true: your symptoms are getting better overall, and you have not had fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication)*. About Preventing Spread of Respiratory Viruses When You're Sick | What To Do If You Get Sick.
After these two criteria are met, there are some additional precautions that can be taken to protect others from respiratory illness.
These include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.
More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies.
Cover coughs and sneezes.
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
Wearing a mask is an additional prevention strategy that you can choose to further protect yourself and others. When worn by a person with an infection, masks reduce the spread of the virus to others. Masks can also protect wearers from breathing in infectious particles from people around them.
Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs spread this way.
You can improve air quality by bringing in fresh outside air, purifying indoor air, or gathering outdoors. Cleaner air can reduce the risk of exposure to viruses.
Treatment
Take flu antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them.
If you are sick with flu, antiviral drugs can be used to treat your illness.
Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. They are prescription medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaled powder) and are not available over-the-counter.
Flu antiviral drugs can make flu illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For people at higher risk of serious flu illness, treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having a milder illness and having a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay.
Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick, but starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person is at higher risk of severe flu illness or is very sick from flu.
If you are at higher risk of severe flu illness and get flu symptoms, call your health care provider early so you can be treated with flu antivirals if needed. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking this drug.
Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people also may have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with influenza virus and have respiratory symptoms without a fever. Visit CDC's website to find out what to do if you get sick with flu. Learn about some of the similarities and differences between flu and COVID-19, and the difference between flu and the common cold.
There are prescription medications called “flu antiviral drugs” that can be used to treat flu illness.

Prevention Through Design
Prevention through Design
KEY POINTS
Prevention through Design can prevent and reduce occupational injuries, illnesses, and fatalities by designing out or minimizing hazards and risks.
NIOSH is committed to the successful implementation of Prevention through Design efforts (see NIOSH strategic goals 5 and 6).
Overview
One of the best ways to prevent and control occupational injuries, illnesses, and fatalities is to ""design out"" or minimize hazards and risks. NIOSH leads a national initiative called Prevention through Design (PtD). The purpose of PtD is to promote this concept and highlight its importance in all business decisions.
Defining
The PtD initiative was developed to support designing out hazards, the most reliable and effective type of prevention. PtD encompasses all of the efforts to anticipate and design out hazards to workers in facilities, work methods and operations, processes, equipment, tools, products, new technologies, and the organization of work. The focus of PtD is on workers who execute the designs or have to work with the products of the design.
Approach
The PtD National Initiative will be developed and implemented by industry sector addressing four functional areas: Research, Education, Practice, and Policy. As the chart below indicates, this process encourages stakeholder input through a sector-based approach consistent with the one used under the National Occupational Research Agenda.
Prevention through Design
The ultimate goal of the PtD initiative is to prevent or reduce occupational injuries, illnesses, and fatalities through the inclusion of prevention considerations into all designs that impact workers.
Along the way, sub-goals will be identified to provide a path toward achieving the primary goal. NIOSH will serve as a catalyst to establish this Initiative, but in the end, the partners and stakeholders must actively participate in addressing these goals to make PtD business as usual.
News & Events
Educational Modules Released
NIOSH has released four PtD educational modules. Each module outlines the motivations for PtD, encourages inclusion of worker health and safety considerations early in the design process, and identifies hazards associated with the topic.

Naegleria fowleri Infection
About Naegleria fowleri Infections
KEY POINTS
Naegleria fowleri is a free-living ameba, a kind of one-celled organism that thrives in warm freshwater lakes, rivers, and hot springs.
It is often called the ""brain-eating ameba"" because it can infect the brain and destroy brain tissue.
Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri are very rare but nearly always fatal.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Naegleria fowleri lives in soil and warm freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs around the world.
In very rare cases, Naegleria fowleri has been found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. The ameba also has been found in tap water.
If water containing the ameba goes up the nose and to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone who gets PAM dies from it.
Between 1962 and 2023, there were 164 reported cases of PAM in the United States. Only four have survived.

Signs and symptoms
Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days.
As PAM progresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations.

Symptoms of Naegleria fowleri Infection
Exposure risks
Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri usually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh water during summer months. Infections often happen when it's been hot for long periods, resulting in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.
A few infections have occurred when people used tap water that contained Naegleria fowleri to rinse their sinuses or cleanse their nasal passages.
In very rare instances, people have become infected from recreational water like splash pads and a surf park that did not have enough chlorine.
You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing water containing the ameba. You also can't get an infection from someone else or pass it on to others.
Keep Reading:
What Causes Naegleria fowleri Infection
Reducing risk
To help protect yourself against a Naegleria fowleri infection:
Hold your nose or wear a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into fresh water.
Always keep your head above water in hot springs.
Don't dig in shallow water because the ameba is more likely to live there.
Use distilled or boiled tap water when rinsing your sinuses or cleansing your nasal passages.

How to Prevent Naegleria fowleri Infection When Rinsing Sinuses or Nasal Passages
Diagnosis
A Naegleria fowleri infection is diagnosed using laboratory tests. These tests are available in only a few labs in the United States, including CDC.
Because these infections are so rare and hard to detect, diagnosis sometimes happens after a person has died.
Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of PAM.
Treatment and recovery
Naegleria fowleri can destroy brain tissue and cause the brain to swell. Unfortunately, more than 97% of people with PAM have died from the infection.
PAM progresses very quickly. This has made treatments for the disease difficult to identify. There is some evidence that certain drugs may be effective.

Clinical Care of Naegleria fowleri Infection
What CDC is doing
CDC's Free-Living and Intestinal Amebas Lab is one of only a few labs in the country that can identify Naegleria fowleri. It is experienced in diagnosing Naegleria fowleri infections and can provide results quickly.

About CDC's Naegleria fowleri Program
Free-living amebas
A free-living ameba is a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water and soil around the world. Most people will come into contact with these amebas during their lives but won't get sick. Others will develop rare but serious infections.
Although there are several types of free-living amebas that live in the environment, three are known to cause severe disease in people:
Acanthamoeba
Balamuthia mandrillaris
Naegleria fowleri
All of these amebas can cause life-threatening brain infections. Some can also cause infections of the eyes, skin, sinuses, and other parts of the body.

Primary Immunodeficiency (PI)
About Primary Immunodeficiency (PI)
KEY POINTS
People with primary immunodeficiency (PI) have an immune system that doesn't work correctly. This makes them more likely to get and become very sick from infections.
PI often has a genetic cause and runs in families. Tell your healthcare provider if you have a family health history of PI.
Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you or your child could have PI.
Finding and treating PI early can prevent or delay some health problems that PI causes.
What it is
Your immune system helps your body fight infections. People with primary immunodeficiency (PI) have an immune system that does not work correctly. This means that people with PI are more likely to get and become very sick from infections.
There are more than 400 types of PI that vary in severity, which affects how early they are detected. In some cases, a person with a mild form may not find out that they have PI until adulthood. In other cases, the disorder causes problems in infancy and is found soon after birth. All states include testing for one type of PI called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
as part of newborn screening. Treatments can help the immune system work better. Which treatment works best depends on the type of PI a person has.
Signs and symptoms
People with PI are more likely to have the following:
More frequent or repeated infections, such as
Ear infections
Sinus infections
Pneumonia
Bronchitis
Meningitis
Skin infections
Thrush (a fungal infection of the mouth or skin, also called candidiasis)
Infections that last longer than in most people
Infections that are hard to treat and do not respond to antibiotics or require IV antibiotics
Infections that are more severe and require hospitalization, such as sepsis or abscesses (pus-filled infections) of internal organs
Infections that most people don't get (sometimes called opportunistic infections)
Lack of weight gain or growth in an infant (failure to thrive)
Digestive problems, such as chronic diarrhea
Talk to your healthcare provider if you think that you or your child has signs of PI. Your healthcare provider might refer you or your child to a clinical immunologist, a healthcare provider who specializes in the immune system. You can use the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology's Find an Allergist/Immunologist tool
to find a healthcare provider near you.
Complications
People with PI are more likely to have autoimmune disorders
and certain blood disorders. Because your immune system protects your body against cancer, people with PI are more likely to have certain cancers. In some cases, PI is due to a genetic disorder that involves other health problems, such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (also called DiGeorge syndrome)
Family health history
PI often has an underlying genetic cause and can run in families. Sharing your family history of PI with your healthcare provider can be important for your and your children's health or if you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. If you or your child have been diagnosed with PI, be sure to share this information with your family members. Your healthcare provider might refer you for genetic counseling and testing if you have been diagnosed with PI or have a family health history of PI.
Prevention and treatment
Early diagnosis can help prevent or delay some of the health problems caused by PI. Left untreated, some types of PI can result in serious health problems, including organ damage, and even death. Even with treatment, most types of PI do not have a cure.
Prevention
Taking steps to prevent infection is very important if you have PI. These steps include
Washing your hands the right way
Taking good care of your teeth
Maintaining healthy habits, including being physically active, eating healthy, and getting enough sleep
Avoiding crowds and exposure to people who are sick
Asking your healthcare provider which vaccinations are safe for you.
In some cases, people with PI cannot have live vaccines such as rotavirus, chickenpox, oral polio, and measles, mumps, rubella. Newborn screening for SCID can find babies with this PI early, before they receive these vaccines, so that they are not given these vaccines prior to treatment for SCID.
Treatment
Treatments vary, depending on the type of PI, and can include
Treatments to prevent infections
Antibiotics and other medicines to prevent certain infections
Treatments that help your immune system work better (including immunoglobulin replacement therapy
and interferon-gamma therapy
)
Treatments to address the underlying cause
Stem cell transplant to provide your body with working immune cells from another person (donor)
Treatments might be available that are specific to your PI. For example, one type of SCID occurs when a person's body doesn't make enough of a type of protein called an enzyme. Treatment for this type of SCID can include enzyme replacement therapy, which involves providing the person's body with the missing enzyme.

Prion Diseases
About Prion Diseases
KEY POINTS
Prion diseases are a family of illnesses that affect people and animals.
These diseases are rare but always lead to death in the person or animal within months to years of symptoms beginning.
There is no treatment or vaccine.
Overview
Prion diseases occur when proteins normally in the body misfold and cause illness. The misfolding leads to brain damage and other symptoms. Symptoms may take years to develop. But once they do, the disease rapidly progresses and leads to death.
Some of the reasons people may get sick with prion diseases is eating or handling meat contaminated with prions. People may also become infected if they get prions in their bodies. This may occur through organ transplant or being exposed to contaminated equipment during surgery.
Types
Prion disease in people
Many different prion diseases affect people, but some are more common than others. The most common prion disease in people is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Another prion disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), has a similar name but is a different, much rarer, disease.
Other prion diseases include kuru, variably protease-sensitive prionopathy, sporadic fatal insomnia, and inherited forms caused by genetic mutations.
CJD
CJD is a prion disease that causes a person's brain to break down or stop working normally. Once symptoms start, the disease progresses quickly. It is always fatal, usually within a year.
CJD is sometimes called ""classic CJD"" to avoid confusion with variant CJD. Most cases of classic CJD are in older people. They appear sporadically. This means there is no known reason that the cases begin.
A smaller number of cases occur in people who inherited genetic changes that make them prone to CJD. Occasionally, there have also been illnesses in people who were exposed to surgical equipment or other products contaminated with prions.
vCJD
vCJD is tied to eating beef from a cow that had a prion disease called Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). It was discovered in 1996 in the United Kingdom.
The disease affected much younger people than CJD. vCJD often infected people their 20s or younger. It caused mental symptoms and behaviors, as well as pain when touching things (dyesthesiasis), that CJD does not.
There have only been four vCJD cases reported in the United States. All occurred in people who were likely exposed to BSE outside the U.S.
Myths and misconceptions
Though they have very similar names, CJD and vCJD are very different. They affect different groups of people and have different causes.
They have different symptoms and affect the body differently. [Table goes here]
How animals are affected
Prion disease in animals
There are a number of known prion diseases in animals. The two most important in the United States are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD).
BSE
BSE is a type of prion disease that affects cows. The first cases were identified in the mid-1980s, but BSE didn't gain widespread attention until a major outbreak in the United Kingdom later that decade into the 1990s. Millions of cows were infected.
By 2005, 24 countries had reported BSE among native cattle. (20 of the 24 were in Europe).
The first BSE case in North America was reported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the United Kingdom. Additional BSE cases were identified in Canada beginning in 2003.
Later that year, a cow in Washington State also tested positive. The cow had come from a Canadian farm prior to being imported into the United States and was likely exposed there. This case remains the only classic BSE case identified in the United States, although cases of atypical BSE have been found.
Experts eventually concluded that the spread of infection in cattle was likely tied to feeding practices. They speculate it began when cows were fed meat and bone meal from other cows that had prion disease.
CWD
CWD is a prion disease that affects animals like deer, elk, moose, and reindeer. It has been found in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Imported cases have also been reported in South Korea. First recognized in Colorado in the late 1960s, CWD has now been identified in 32 U.S. states.
Though there have been no cases of CWD in people, experts think it poses a theoretical risk to people. This is because CWD is related to BSE, which has caused disease in people. If CWD could spread to people, hunters and people who eat meat from CWD-infected animals would likely be most at risk.

THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF PRION DISEASES1 (cdc.gov)

Correctional Health
Public Health Considerations for Correctional Health
PURPOSE
To provide people who are justice system-involved, correctional facility staff, public health professionals, community organizations, and anyone else with an interest in correctional health with resources.
Review CDC resources, guidelines, and data on correctional health and justice-involved populations
Correctional health is community health
CDC provides treatment guidelines and other correctional health resources.
Correctional health encompasses all aspects of health and well-being for adults and juveniles who are justice system*-involved. This starts at the point of arrest, continues at detention or incarceration, and carries through after they return to their community (called ""reentry""). Correctional health also includes the health of families and communities of persons who are justice system-involved, as well as the health administrators and staff who work in facilities.
Justice System-Involved
A person who is 'justice system-involved' is any person who is currently or has ever been arrested or incarcerated in a detention or correctional facility. This term also includes those reentering their communities after detention or incarceration, including those on parole or probation. 'Criminal legal system' may also be used as an alternative to 'justice system' to reflect historic and current challenges to achieving justice in the U.S. criminal legal system.
Persons who are justice system-involved are more likely to experience risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB), latent TB infection (LTBI), and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and concussions. The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries is higher than in the general population. Additionally, a high proportion of people with justice system involvement have a history of unstable housing and mental health and substance use disorders, which increases vulnerability and risk for HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection, and injuries like TBI. This puts many in need of linkage to substance use and mental health treatment, employment, and permanent housing upon release. Justice-involvement also leads to family and community instability and adverse childhood events, with 1 in 28 children having a caregiver who is incarcerated.
Taken together, these multiple health conditions and social determinates of health contribute to the health disparities found in this population and their communities.
CDC has worked to provide people who are justice system-involved, correctional facility staff, public health professionals, community organizations, and anyone else with an interest in correctional health with data, testing and treatment guidelines, educational materials, and other correctional health resources.

Develops and provides useful health education materials for staff and justice-involved persons.
Reentry
Supports projects that improve the continuity of care for people returning to their communities.
Offers policy and planning guidance that support efforts to improve the continuity of care within communities.
Surveillance
Identifies/monitors cases and potential exposures to HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, TB, and other pathogens among persons who are justice-involved or work in correctional facilities.
Statistics
The prevalence of infections, diseases, and injuries among people who are incarcerated is higher than in the general population.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
, over 5 million people are estimated to be under the supervision of U.S. adult correctional systems (in prison or jail, or on probation or parole). Many persons who are justice-involved experience multiple risk factors for HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI), and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and concussions. The prevalence of these infections, diseases, and injuries among people who are incarcerated is higher than in the general population.
HIV
In 2021, about 1.1% of persons incarcerated in state and federal prisons were known to be persons with HIV; this rate was three times higher than the prevalence in the general U.S. population.
In 2021, 16 U.S. states conducted mandatory HIV testing of all persons under state law enforcement custody, and 23 states and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons offered opt-out HIV testing, accounting for 84% of all persons admitted and sentenced to more than 1 year in the custody of state and federal correctional authorities.
In a 2013 survey of women across 20 metropolitan areas with high HIV prevalence, women who were recently incarcerated were significantly more likely to have factors that increase their risk for HIV infection than those who were never incarcerated, including receiving money or drugs in exchange for sex with a partner, multiple casual partners, multiple casual condomless partners, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis.
More information on HIV surveillance in the United States.
Viral hepatitis
In 2009, a systematic review of 23 studies from incarcerated populations in the U.S. reported a wide chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence range of 0.9%–11.4%.
HBV prevalence has been estimated to be 3 to 38 times higher in correctional settings than in the general population in 2009.
From 2013–2016, people who were incarcerated were estimated to have a rate of current hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 10 times higher (10.7% vs 1%) than persons in the general population.
Approximately 30% of all persons infected with HCV in the United States spend at least part of the year in correctional facilities.
More information on Viral Hepatitis surveillance in the United States.
STIs
Males and females 35 years of age and younger in juvenile and adult detention facilities have been reported to have higher rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea than nonincarcerated persons in the community.
Jail-based chlamydia screen-and-treat programs can potentially decrease chlamydia prevalence in communities with higher incarceration rates —as much as 13% in large communities and 54% in small communities.
More information on STIs among persons in correctional facilities.
Tuberculosis (TB)
In 2021, 2.4% of persons 15 years of age or older diagnosed with tuberculosis were current residents of correctional facilities at the time of diagnosis.
From 2003–2013, annual median tuberculosis incidence was about 6 times higher for persons in jails and federal prisons compared with the general population.
An analysis during 2011–2019 demonstrated that large tuberculosis outbreaks still occur in state prisons and account for a large proportion of total tuberculosis cases in some states.
For more information on TB risk and people who live or work in correctional facilities.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
Research in the United States and from other countries suggests almost half (46%) of people in correctional or detention facilities such as prisons and jails have a history of TBI, but the exact number is not known.
Studies show an association between people in correctional or detention facilities with a history of TBI and mental health problems, such as severe depression and anxiety, substance use disorders, difficulty controlling anger, and suicidal thoughts and/or attempts.
People in correctional or detention facilities with TBI-related problems may not be screened for a TBI or may face challenges with getting TBI-related care. These challenges may continue after a person is released from the facility.

Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality
AT A GLANCE
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protects privacy and confidentiality in accordance with federal laws.
CDC uses Certificates of Confidentiality and other resources to protect identifiable and potentially identifiable information.
Overview
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commits to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information we have, in accordance with federal laws. The Privacy and Confidentiality Unit (PCU) provides guidance on privacy and confidentiality for all federally funded and supported activities through consultation and issuance of Assurances of Confidentiality to CDC programs.
Privacy
CDC provides technical support and education to CDC employees; grantees; partners; and state, Tribal, and local health departments on:
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
Other federal privacy laws.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
The HIPAA Privacy Rule
(45 CFR Parts 160
and 164
) regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, called protected health information (PHI), by covered entities. The Privacy Rule protects all PHI transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g. electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity or its business associates. It excludes certain educational and employment records.
The Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights in respect to their health information including, but not limited to, the right to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of their privacy rights and how their PHI will be used and disclosed.
The Privacy Rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without the written authorization from the individual; however, there are several exceptions to this requirement including disclosures
for public health activities.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g
; 34 CFR Part 99
) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Health care information is generally part of the education record. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
FERPA gives parents certain rights regarding their child's education record. These rights include the right to inspect and request corrections to the record. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.
FERPA generally prohibits the disclosure of any personally identifiable information contained in an education record without the appropriate written consent. FERPA offers limited exceptions to this requirement.
Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality (CoCs) protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable and potentially identifiable research information, with limited exceptions.
Any investigator or institution issued a CoC shall not:
Disclose or provide covered information, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding.
Disclose or provide covered information to any other person not connected with the research.
CDC investigators with a CoC may ONLY disclose identifiable and potentially identifiable information in the following circumstances:
If required by other federal, state, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases.
If the subject consents.
For the purposes of scientific research that is compliant with human subjects' regulations.
CoCs cover any CDC-funded research project collecting or using identifiable and potentially identifiable information, in compliance with Section 301(d)
of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). All CDC-funded research activities are automatically issued a CoC through their award. No physical certificate will be issued. The CoC will apply as a term and condition of award. This applies to:
Grants.
Cooperative Agreements.
Contracts.
CDC-sponsored intramural research.
For research activities enrolling human participants, CDC requires investigators to inform participants of the CoC protections and the limits to those protections.
Assurance of Confidentiality
An Assurance of Confidentiality (AoC) is a formal confidentiality protection authorized under Section 308(d)
of the PHSA. CDC investigators use it to collect or maintain sensitive identifiable information from individuals and institutions. The law states that no identifiable information may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied. The exception is if such institution or individual consented to that disclosure. Protected information includes identifiable information on institutions or individuals who are the subjects of non-research, public health activities with an approved AoC.
CDC implements agency AoC protection for public health activities conducted by CDC investigators that involve the collection or maintenance of identifiable information. This protection allows CDC programs to assure individuals and institutions involved in non-research activities (e.g., surveillance) that those conducting the activity will protect the confidentiality of the identifiable data collected.
Disclosures can be made without individual authorization only for purposes stated at the time of data collection or specifically consented to thereafter by each of the parties provided the promise of confidentiality.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa
About Pseudomonas aeruginosa
KEY POINTS
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infections typically occur in healthcare settings.
Good hand hygiene and infection prevention and control can help reduce the risk of infection.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be resistant to antibiotics, making these infections difficult to treat.
Overview
Pseudomonas is a group of bacteria commonly found in the environment, like in soil and water. The most common type causing infections among humans is Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
P. aeruginosa can cause infections in the blood, lungs (pneumonia), urinary tract or other parts of the body after surgery.
Types
Some types are resistant to nearly all antibiotics, including carbapenems, known as multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa. In 2017, MDR P. aeruginosa caused an estimated 32,600 infections among hospitalized patients and 2,700 estimated deaths in the United States.1
At-risk populations
Patients in healthcare settings are at highest risk, especially those who:
Are on breathing machines (ventilators).
Have devices such as catheters.
Have open wounds from surgery or burns.
How it spreads
Contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment.
Exposure in the soil or water.
Person-to-person contact, like from contaminated hands.
Reducing risk
Patients and caregivers should:
Keep their hands clean, particularly before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device.
Remind people (including healthcare providers) to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting.
Healthcare providers and facilities should:
Always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Have water management plans in place.
Testing
To determine if someone has a P. aeruginosa infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This test can also determine what treatment will work best.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment generally includes antibiotics. Unfortunately, treatment options are limited for MDR P. aeruginosa.
What CDC is doing
Providing testing to identify antimicrobial resistance cases, measure resistance and track transmission in a healthcare setting through the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network.
Tracking P. aeruginosa infections through the National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by P. aeruginosa and slow the spread of resistant germs.

Healthy Swimming
Preventing Hot Tub Rash
KEY POINTS
If contaminated water stays on someone's skin for a long time, it can cause a rash known as ""hot tub rash"" (Pseudomonas folliculitis).
Hot tub rash is caused by the germ Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is commonly found in the environment (for example, in water or soil).
Symptoms of hot tub rash
Hot tub rash usually appears a few days after sitting in a poorly maintained hot tub.
Hot tub rash can affect people of all ages. It is often worse in areas where a swimsuit held contaminated water up against the skin. Symptoms include:
Itchy, red, and bumpy rash
Pus-filled blisters around hair follicles
Mild rashes usually clear up in a few days without medical treatment. Check with your healthcare provider if a rash gets worse or if you get it more than once.
Prevention steps and strategies
To reduce the risk of hot tub rash
Remove your swimsuit and shower with soap after getting out of the water, especially hot tubs.
Wash your swimsuit after using it.
Use test strips to check the water, especially in hot tubs, for adequate disinfectant level and pH. CDC recommends the following disinfectant (chlorine or bromine) and pH levels for hot tubs:
Chlorine: at least 3 parts per million (ppm or mg/L). If the reading is above 10ppm, talk to the operator or owner.
Bromine: 4–8 ppm
pH: 7.0–7.8
If chlorine level, bromine level, or pH is not within the correct range, tell the operator or owner immediately.

PARASITES 
About Pubic ""Crab"" Lice
KEY POINTS
Pubic lice, also known as ""crab"" lice, are parasitic insects found in the pubic or genital area.
They are usually spread by sexual contact.
Symptoms include itching or visible lice in the genital area.
Both prescription and over-the-counter treatments can treat pubic lice.
Overview
Pubic lice are parasitic insects that feed on human blood. They are short and crab-like and look very different from head and body lice. Pubic lice typically attach to hair in the pubic area. Adult pubic lice are 1.1–1.8 mm in length (size of a pencil tip).
Either over-the-counter or prescription medications can treat pubic lice infestations. Infestation or infested person means that a person has lice.
Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of pubic lice include:
Itching in the genital area
Visible nits (lice eggs)
Lice crawling or attached to pubic hair
Lice in other hairy areas (eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, mustache, armpits, chest, back)
Pubic lice do not transmit disease. However, you could get sores and a bacterial infection from intense scratching.
Who is at risk
Anyone can get pubic lice. Pubic lice usually spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults.
How it spreads
You usually get pubic lice from intimate, person-to-person contact, usually sexual contact. Occasionally pubic lice can spread by clothing, bedding, or (very rarely) using a toilet seat that was just used by a person infested with public lice.
Adult pubic lice are found only on humans and require blood to survive. They will die within 24 – 48 hours without a blood meal. Female adult pubic lice lay about 30 eggs during their 3 – 4-week life span. Eggs hatch after about a week. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) mature into adults over 6 to 9 days.
Animals do not get or spread pubic lice.
Pubic lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication of sexual exposure or abuse.
Prevention
The following are steps that can help prevent and control the spread of pubic (""crab"") lice:
Examine yourself and seek treatment if you experience any of the symptoms of pubic lice or a sexual partner has recently had pubic lice.
All sexual contacts should be examined. All those who are infested should be treated.
Avoid all sexual contact with others until treatment is successful.
Machine wash and dry worn clothing and used bedding by the infested person in the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store them for two weeks.
Do not share clothing, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with pubic lice.
Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control pubic (""crab"") lice. They can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
Diagnosis
Pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a ""crab"" louse or nits on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body. These areas include the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, groin, torso, scalp, or anus. Pubic lice are short and crab-like; they appear very different from head and body lice (I.e., they are broader and flatter than other lice). Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to see them.
Lice found on the head generally are head lice, not pubic lice.
If you are unsure about infestation or if treatment is not successful, see a healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Consider getting tested for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
Treatment and recovery
You can treat pubic lice with a lice-killing lotion containing 1% permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide.
These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription at a local drug store or pharmacy. These medications are safe and effective when used exactly according to the instructions in the package or on the label.

Public Health Ethics
KEY POINTS
Public health ethics brings considerations, such as principles and values, to the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Public health ethics uses a systematic approach to clarify, prioritize, and justify possible courses of public health action.
Access training materials to learn more about public health ethics.
Background
As the nation's leading public health agency, CDC primarily takes a population-based approach to public health, targeting communities or populations in its activities. The public health problems that CDC addresses are often complex, involving multiple risk factors and multiple stakeholders. There are also many different perspectives on how to prevent or help health concerns and promote well-being.
CDC staff use a variety of scientific tools in their work. They use epidemiology, behavioral and social science, communication science, laboratory science, and many others. Another critical tool for public health decision making and action is public health ethics. Public health ethics brings considerations, such as principles and values, to the discussion. Public health ethics uses a systematic approach to clarify, prioritize, and justify possible courses of public health action. These actions are based on ethical principles, values and beliefs of stakeholders, and scientific and other information.
CDC and public health ethics
What public health ethics are
Public health ethics can be broken down into a field of study and a field of practice. As a field of study, public health ethics seeks to understand and clarify principles and values which guide public health actions. Principles and values provide a framework for decision making and a means of justifying decisions. Because public health actions are often undertaken by governments and are directed at the population level, the principles and values which guide public health can differ from those which guide actions in biology and clinical medicine (bioethics and medical ethics) which are more patient or individual-centered.
As a field of practice, public health ethics is the application of relevant principles and values to public health decision making. In applying an ethics framework, public health ethics inquiry carries out three core functions, namely:
Identifying and clarifying the ethical dilemma posed.
Analyzing it in terms of alternative courses of action and their consequences.
Resolving the dilemma by deciding which course of action best incorporates and balances the guiding principles and values.
Goals and structure for public health ethics at CDC
The CDC Office of Science supports CDC's public health ethics capacity to foster an environment and culture that:
Supports and develops ethical practices.
Raises staff awareness of public health ethics
Provides support for analyzing ethical issues.

Public Health Workforce Development
About Public Health Workforce Development
AT A GLANCE
Investments in the public health workforce build capacity for state, tribal, local, and territorial public health agencies to provide essential public health services. This capacity is critical for communities to be able to respond to emergencies and thrive.
Important things to know
Decades of underinvestment have undermined the public health workforce—America's first line of defense against disease outbreaks and other health threats.
With diminished funding and hiring barriers, health departments at state, local, tribal and territorial levels are unable to recruit and retain skilled professionals.
175 million Americans
are living in communities that experienced stagnant or reduced local health department funding in 2019, impacting over half of the U.S. population.
Shrinking staff and reduced capacity have led to
Workers unprepared to keep up with changes in technology
A lack of systems and data to assess and monitor workforce needs
Added work-related stress and burnout among the existing workforce
Building Work Capacity
The Division of Workforce Development (DWD) provides leadership to chart a path forward for multi-level public health workforce development. DWD engages CDC programs and public health partners to share quality science, make data-driven decisions, and support strategic workforce development.

About Pulmonary Hypertension
KEY POINTS
Pulmonary hypertension is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal.
The increased blood pressure in the lungs can make the heart work harder than normal to pump blood into the lungs. This can damage the heart and cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness.
What it is
With pulmonary hypertension, the blood vessels to the lungs develop an increased amount of muscle in the wall of the blood vessels. The heart pumps blood from the right ventricle to the lungs to get oxygen. Because the blood does not have to travel very far, the pressure in this side of the heart and in the artery taking blood from the right ventricle to the lungs is normally low—usually much lower than systolic or diastolic blood pressure.
When the pressure in this artery gets too high, the arteries in the lungs can narrow and then the blood does not flow as well as it should, resulting in less oxygen in the blood.1

Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension during the initial stage of the disease are common to many other medical conditions (e.g., difficulty breathing, fatigue). This often results in a delayed diagnosis until more severe symptoms arise, such as:
Dizziness
Chest pain
Ankle swelling
Feeling the heart race or pound (palpitations).23
Risk factors
Pulmonary hypertension happens at all ages, including among children, and its incidence increases with age.
Pulmonary hypertension is more common among women, non-Hispanic Black people, and people aged 75 or older.
Causes
Some common underlying causes of pulmonary hypertension include high blood pressure in the lungs' arteries due to some types of congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, liver disease (cirrhosis), blood clots to the lungs, and chronic lung diseases like emphysema. Genetics also play a role.
Pulmonary hypertension can happen in association with many other diseases, such as lung disease and heart disease. Heart failure is common in pulmonary hypertension.
Reducing risk
While not all pulmonary hypertension can be prevented, you can take steps to prevent it by making healthy lifestyle changes and managing high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic lung disease from tobacco use.
Treatment and recovery
There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. However, there are many different types of treatments, including:
Inhaled medicine.
Medicine given through the veins under the skin.
Medicine to reduce swelling in the feet (diuretics).
Oxygen therapy.

PulseNet
About PulseNet
KEY POINTS
PulseNet was established in 1996
The mission of PulseNet is to connect foodborne illness cases together using the DNA 'fingerprints' of the bacteria making people sick in order to detect outbreaks
Overview
PulseNet is a national laboratory network that connects foodborne, waterborne, and One Health–related illness cases to detect outbreaks. PulseNet uses the DNA fingerprints of bacteria making people sick to detect thousands of local and multistate outbreaks. Since the network began in 1996, PulseNet has improved food safety systems through identifying outbreaks early. This allows investigators to find the source, alert the public sooner, and identify gaps in food safety systems that would not otherwise be recognized. PulseNet International performs a similar role for foodborne illnesses globally.
Whole genome sequencing helps identify foodborne bacteria to detect outbreaks
