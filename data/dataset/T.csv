Chemical Emergencies
Tabun
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Tabun is a human-made warfare nerve agent.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
Get clean and get medical attention if you were exposed.
Do not force yourself to vomit or drink fluids if tabun has been swallowed.
Background
Tabun, sometimes known as ""GA,"" is a man-made chemical warfare agent that is a type of nerve agent. Nerve agents are the most toxic (harmful) and fast acting of the known chemical warfare agents.
Nerve agents are similar to a type of pesticide called organophosphates. They are similar in terms of how they work and the kinds of harmful effects they cause. However, nerve agents are much stronger than organophosphate pesticides.
It can be described as:
Liquid
Clear or colorless-to-brown, depending on purity
Tasteless
Having a faint fruity smell
A vapor (gas) if heated
Did you know?
Tabun was developed as a pesticide (chemical used to kill insects) in Germany in 1936.
Where it is found
Tabun is not found naturally in the environment.
It is possible that tabun and/or other nerve agents were used in chemical warfare during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.
How it works
All the nerve agents cause their toxic effects by preventing enzymes from working. Enzymes act as the body's ""off switch"" for glands and muscles. Without an ""off switch,"" the glands and muscles are constantly working. They may get tired and no longer be able to keep working on things such as breathing.
Compared with other nerve agents, tabun is more volatile than VX (another nerve agent) but less volatile than sarin. Because of its high volatility, tabun is an immediate health threat.
A higher volatility means it is more likely to:
Evaporate from a liquid into a gas.
Spread into the environment.
Remain on surfaces for a shorter period of time.
People can be exposed to the gas even if they do not come in contact with the liquid form. Because of its high volatility, tabun is an immediate health threat.
Signs and symptoms
The level of tabun poisoning depends on the amount and form (gas or liquid) of tabun a person was exposed to. It also depends on how the person was exposed (e.g., skin contact, breathing in gas, etc.) and for how long.
Symptoms likely will appear within a few seconds after exposure to the gas form of tabun. Symptoms will likely appear and within a few minutes to hours after exposure to the liquid form.
People can be exposed to a low or medium amount of tabun by breathing it in, swallowing it, or skin absorption. Exposure to low to medium amounts may lead to some or all of the following symptoms within seconds to hours:
Abnormally low or high blood pressure
Blurred vision
Chest tightness
Confusion
Cough
Diarrhea
Drooling and excessive sweating
Drowsiness
Eye pain
Headache
Increased urination
Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain
Rapid (fast) breathing
Runny nose
Slow or fast heart rate
Small, pinpoint pupils
Watery eyes
Weakness
Even a small drop of a nerve agent on the skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching where the agent touched.
Exposure to a large amount of tabun in any way can cause these additional health effects:
Loss of consciousness
Convulsions (seizures)
Paralysis
Respiratory (breathing) failure possibly leading to death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to tabun.
Exposure
If tabun is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact or by breathing it in. Because tabun vapor (gas) is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase chances of exposure there.
Tabun mixes easily with water, so it could be used to poison water. If tabun is in the water, people can be exposed by drinking the water or getting the water on their skin.
If tabun is in food, people can be exposed by eating the food. A person's clothes can also release tabun if it touched tabun gas, which can expose other people.
Tabun has a faint fruity smell. However, the smell may not be noticeable or strong enough to give people enough warning that it is near.
What to do if you are exposed
Recovery from tabun exposure is possible with treatment, but the antidotes (cure) must be used quickly to be effective. Therefore, the best thing to do is avoid exposure.
Leave the area
Get fresh air by leaving the area where the tabun was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chances of death from tabun gas.
If the tabun was released outdoors, move away from the area where the tabun was released. Go to the highest ground possible, because tabun is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas.
If tabun was released indoors, get out of the building.
If you're in immediate danger
Do not force yourself to vomit or drink fluids if tabun has been swallowed.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing with tabun on it as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, avoid touching unsafe areas.
Throw your clothes away
Put your clothing inside a plastic bag. Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.
For more information about cleaning your body and throwing away your clothes after a chemical exposure, visit ""About Getting Clean.""
Wash your body
Wash any liquid tabun from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
When to seek emergency care
Seek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Treatment
Treatment involves removing tabun from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital.
Antidotes (cures) are available for tabun. They are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.
Long-term health effects
Mildly exposed people usually recover completely. Severely exposed people are less likely to survive.

Human Tapeworm (Taeniasis)
PARASITES 
About Human Tapeworm
KEY POINTS
Human tapeworm, or taeniasis, is a parasitic infection.
Most people with taeniasis have mild or no symptoms.
Human tapeworm is a different parasite than dog or cat tapeworm.
MORE INFORMATION

Health Care Providers
Overview
Taeniasis in humans is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm species Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), and Taenia asiatica (Asian tapeworm). Humans can become infected with these tapeworms by eating raw or undercooked beef (T. saginata) or pork (T. solium and T. asiatica). People with taeniasis may not know they have a tapeworm infection because symptoms are usually mild or nonexistent.
T. solium tapeworm infections can lead to cysticercosis, which is a disease that can cause seizures, so it is important seek treatment.
Species
Taeniasis in humans is a parasitic infection caused by these tapeworm species
Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm)
Taenia solium (pork tapeworm)
Taenia asiatica (Asian tapeworm)
Taenia saginata and T. solium are found worldwide. Infections with T. saginata occur wherever contaminated raw beef is eaten, particularly in Eastern Europe, Russia, eastern Africa and Latin America. Taeniasis due to T. saginata is rare in the United States, except in places where cattle and people are concentrated and sanitation is poor, such as around feed lots where cattle can be exposed to human feces. Tapeworm infections due to T. solium are more prevalent in under-developed communities with poor sanitation and where people eat raw or undercooked pork. Higher rates of illness have been seen in people in Latin America, Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia. Taenia solium taeniasis is seen in the United States, typically among Latin American immigrants. Taenia asiatica is limited to Asia and is seen mostly in the Republic of Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand.
Symptoms
Most people with tapeworm infections have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Patients with T. saginata taeniasis often experience more symptoms that those with T. solium or T. asiatica infections because the T. saginata tapeworm is larger in size (up to 10 meters (m)) than the other two tapeworms (usually 3 m). Tapeworms can cause digestive problems including abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, and upset stomach. The most visible sign of taeniasis is the active passing of proglottids (tapeworm segments) through the anus and in the feces. In rare cases, tapeworm segments become lodged in the appendix, or the bile and pancreatic ducts.
Be aware
Infection with T. solium tapeworms can result in human cysticercosis, which can be a very serious disease that can cause seizures and muscle or eye damage.
Taenia saginata does not cause cysticercosis in humans. It is not clear if T. asiatica causes cysticercosis in humans or not.
Causes and spread
Eating raw or undercooked contaminated beef or pork is the primary risk factor for acquiring taeniasis. Because of this, certain groups with dietary restrictions for these meats may have a lower risk of taeniasis.
A disease called cysticercosis can occur when T. solium tapeworm eggs are ingested. For example, people with poor hygiene who have taeniasis—with or without symptoms—will shed tapeworm eggs in their feces and might accidentally contaminate their environment. This can lead to transmission of cysticercosis to themselves or others unknowingly.
Prevention
One way to prevent taeniasis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. A food thermometer should be used to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is cooked. USDA recommends the following for meat preparation.
For Whole Cuts of Meat (excluding poultry)
Cook to at least 145° F (63° C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming.
For Ground Meat (excluding poultry)
Cook to at least 160° F (71° C); ground meats do not require a rest* time.
*According to USDA, ""A 'rest time' is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven, or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys pathogens.""
Resource
Cook to a Safe Minimum Internal Temperature | FoodSafety.gov
Testing and diagnosis
Diagnosis of Taenia tapeworm infections is made by examination of stool samples; individuals should also be asked if they have passed tapeworm segments. Stool specimens should be collected on three different days and examined in the lab for Taenia eggs using a microscope. Tapeworm eggs can be detected in the stool 2 – 3 months after the tapeworm infection is established.
Tapeworm eggs of T. solium can also infect humans, causing cysticercosis. It is important to diagnose and treat all tapeworm infections.
Treatment
Treatment is available after accurate diagnosis. Praziquantel is the drug of choice. Niclosamide is an alternative drug. See your healthcare provider for proper treatment and care.
Animal transmission
The tapeworm that your pet was diagnosed with is more than likely the flea tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum). Dog or cat tapeworm infections are a result of your pet swallowing a parasite-contaminated flea. Only in very rare instances do humans accidentally swallow the contaminated fleas.

Talaromycosis
FUNGAL DISEASES
Talaromycosis (Penicilliosis) Basics
KEY POINTS
Talaromycosis (formerly penicilliosis), a fungal infection, spreads in Southeast Asia, southern China, and India.
Talaromycosis usually affects people with weakened immune systems.
Bumps on the skin are common. Other symptoms vary and affect different parts of the body.
Talaromycosis typically affects people with HIV differently than others who get infected.
Overview
Talaromycosis, formerly called penicillosis, is an infection caused by the fungus Talaromyces marneffei.
Talaromycosis affects people who live in or visit Southeast Asia, southern China, or northeastern India. Most people who get talaromycosis have a weakened immune system. People living with HIV are particularly at risk.
Skin bumps are a common sign of Tarlarmycosis. Other symptoms can include fever and cough. Talaromycosis usually affects people with HIV differently than other people who get infected.
Signs and symptoms
Most people who get talaromycosis already had a weakened immune system. Talarmycosis typically affects people with HIV differently than other people who get infected.
Common symptoms
Bumps on the skin are a common symptom. They are usually small and painless. The bumps usually appear on the face and neck but can also appear in other places on the body.
Other symptoms include:
Fever
General discomfort
Weight loss
Cough or shortness of breath
Swollen lymph nodes, liver, or spleen
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
The fungus can make people sick weeks to years after they come in contact with it.
Infections in people who have HIV
In people with advanced HIV disease, talaromycosis is more likely to spread to the bloodstream and other parts of the body. Skin bumps, fever and swelling of the spleen are also more common symptoms in people living with HIV. Skin bumps have a slightly different appearance and have a dent in the middle.
Infections in people who do not have HIV
Talaromycosis more commonly affects the mouth, throat, lungs, liver, and bone in people who do not have HIV. However it is still possible for infections to spread into the blood and other parts of hte body. Skin bumps are smooth without indentation in people with talaromycosis who do not have HIV.
Risk factors
Talaromycosis affects people who live in or visit Southeast Asia, southern China, or eastern India. Healthy people rarely get talaromycosis.
Most people who get talaromycosis have a medical condition that weakens their immune system, such as:
Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome
Cancer
HIV/AIDS
Organ transplant
Other autoimmune diseases
Agricultural workers and farmers, particularly those working during the rainy season, appear to be more likely to get talaromycosis.
Global burden of talaromycosis
SOURCE: Thuy Le, M.D., D.Phil., Associate Professor, Duke University School of Medicine
Causes
Scientitsts believe that people get talaromycosis after breathing in T. marneffei from the environment. Bamboo rats can also get talaromycosis but there is no evidence that it spreads from rats to people. Talaromycosis does not spread from person to person.
In Thailand, infections are more common during rainy seasons so rain might promote the growth of the fungus.
Talaromyces marneffei
Talaromyces marneffei can change from its native mold form in the environment to a parasitic yeast once in a warm-blooded host. In the environment (at 25°C), the mold form produces yellow green colonies and a characteristic soluble red pigment

Show Text Description
Prevention
A healthcare provider might prescribe medicine to prevent talaromycosis in high-risk individuals. This includes people with weakened immune systems and who live in places where the fungus is present. Itraconazole is the most commonly used medicine to prevent talaromycosis. However, healthcare providers also can prescribe other antifungal medicines.
Testing and diagnosis
Talaromycosis can be diagnosed by using a sample from the body part that is affected. For example:
Bone marrow
Blood
Fluid in and around the lungs
Lymph node
Skin
The sample is sent to a laboratory for a fungal culture or to be examined under the microscope. The sample can also be tested for the presence of a protein or DNA of the fungus.

The tapeworm that your pet was diagnosed with is more than likely the flea tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum). Dog or cat tapeworm infections are a result of your pet swallowing a parasite-contaminated flea. Only in very rare instances do humans accidentally swallow the contaminated fleas.
Dog and Cat Tapeworm
DECEMBER 19, 2023
About Dog or Cat Tapeworm Infection
KEY POINTS
Dipylidium is a tapeworm of cats and dogs.
It is a parasite that can also infect people.
Dipylidium infection is easily treatable in dogs, cats, and people.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Dipylidium caninum is a common tapeworm of dogs and cats in the United States and throughout the world. Dogs and cats get Dipylidium tapeworm by swallowing a flea infected with a tapeworm larvae, often while grooming themselves. The larval tapeworm will then develop into an adult tapeworm in the animal's intestine. People get Dipylidium tapeworm the same way dogs and cats do, by swallowing a flea infected with tapeworm larvae.
The adult tapeworm is made up of many small segments called proglottids. Each proglottid is about the size of a grain of rice. Adult tapeworms may measure 4 – 28 inches in length. As the tapeworm grows inside the intestine, these segments (proglottids) break off and pass in the stool.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Dipylidium page.
Signs and symptoms
Most dogs and cats infected with Dipylidium tapeworm do not show signs of illness. However, you can sometimes see the proglottids crawling near the animal's anus (butt) or on the surface of a fresh bowel movement. Dried out proglottids look like grains of rice: they are small, about 2 mm, hard, and yellowish in color. You can sometimes see them stuck to the fur around your pet's butt.
Most people infected with Dipylidium tapeworms also do not show signs of illness. It is more likely that you will recognize a Dipylidium infection when you see tapeworm segments in your or your child's feces (poop).
Causes
Dogs and cats get Dipylidium tapeworm by swallowing a flea infected with a tapeworm larvae, often while grooming themselves. The larval tapeworm will then develop into an adult tapeworm in the animal's intestines. The segments of the adult tapeworm, proglottids, break off and pass in the animal's stool. The proglottids contain tapeworm eggs. Once the proglottid dries out, the eggs release into the environment. Flea larvae then feed on the Dipylidium eggs and start the cycle over again.
People get Dipylidium tapeworm the same way dogs and cats do, by swallowing a flea infected with tapeworm larvae. Most reported cases are in children.
Prevention
The most effective way to prevent Dipylidium infection in pets and people is through flea control. Other ways to prevent infection include
Have your veterinarian treat your dogs and cats if they have tapeworms.
Clean up after your pet, especially in playgrounds and public parks. Place the poop in a plastic bag and dispose of it in the trash. If plastic bags or trash are not available, bury it.
Do not allow children to play in areas soiled with pet or other animal feces.
Teach children to always wash their hands after petting or playing with dogs and cats, and after playing outdoors.
Diagnosis
In Dogs and Cats
Your veterinarian will not typically find Dipylidium tapeworm eggs in a routine fecal (poop) exam. They rely on the pet's owner to notice the tapeworm segments (proglottids) crawling around the anus or in the pet's feces.
In People
Most infections in people are diagnosed clinically. This means your healthcare provider will look for the tapeworm segments around a person's anus or in their feces. Your healthcare provider may also do a stool exam to look for eggs or tapeworm segments.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment is simple and very effective for both animals and people. If you think your pet has Dipylidium tapeworms, talk to your veterinarian about treating your pet.
When people have Dipylidium infection, their healthcare provider can prescribe praziquantel to treat the infection. The medication is well-tolerated and causes the tapeworm to dissolve within the intestine.

Tuberculosis (TB)
Testing for Tuberculosis
KEY POINTS
There are two types of tests for tuberculosis (TB) infection: the TB blood test and the TB skin test.
A positive test result for TB infection means you have TB germs in your body.
If you test positive for TB infection, your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB (also called latent TB infection) or active TB disease.
Why get tested
Getting tested and treated for TB can protect yourself, your family and friends, and your community.
You may need a TB test if you have:
Symptoms of TB disease
Spent time with someone who has active TB disease
Factors that put you at higher risk of developing active TB disease
Employment, school, travel, or immigration health screening requirements
You may need a TB test even if you do not feel sick. TB germs can live in your body for years without making you feel sick. This is called inactive TB. People with inactive TB do not feel sick and cannot spread TB germs to others.
Keep Reading:
Treating Tuberculosis
Who should be tested
If you are at higher risk of being infected with TB germs, you should get tested.
You have a higher risk of being exposed to TB germs if you:
Were born in or frequently travel to countries where TB is common, including some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America
Live or used to live in large group settings where TB is more common, such as homeless shelters, prisons, or jails
Recently spent time with someone who has active TB disease
Work in places where TB is more likely to spread, such as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, and nursing homes
Some people who have inactive TB never develop TB disease, and others with inactive TB develop active TB disease months or even years later when their immune system can no longer keep the TB germs from multiplying and growing in the body.
Anyone can get TB, but some people who have inactive TB are more likely to develop TB disease than others.
You have a higher risk of developing TB disease once infected if you:
Have a weaker immune system because of certain medications or health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or HIV
Became infected with TB germs in the last two years
Are a baby or young child, especially under five years of age
Inject illegal drugs
Are sick with other diseases that weaken the immune system
Are elderly
Were not treated correctly for TB in the past
TB tests are generally not needed for people with a low risk of infection with TB germs.
Keep Reading:
Tuberculosis Risk Factors
Types of tests
There are two types of tests for TB infection: the TB blood test and the TB skin test. Ask your health care provider which TB test is best for you.
TB blood test
TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) use a blood sample to find out if you are infected with TB germs. The tests measure how your immune system reacts when a small amount of your blood is mixed with TB proteins.
Tell your health care provider if you received a TB vaccine
Many people born outside the United States have received the TB vaccine (also known as Bacille Calmette-Guérin or BCG).

TB blood tests are the preferred test for people who have received the TB vaccine. Unlike the TB skin test, TB blood tests are not affected by BCG vaccination.
Keep Reading:
Testing for Tuberculosis: Blood Test
TB skin test
For the TB skin test, a health care provider uses a small needle to put some testing material under the skin. You will need to return to your health care provider in two to three days to see if there is a reaction.
Keep Reading:
Testing for Tuberculosis: Skin Test
Other tests may be needed
Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease if you have a:
Positive TB blood test or TB skin test result
Negative TB blood test or TB skin test result, but you have symptoms of active TB disease
These tests may include a chest x-ray, and a test of the sputum (phlegm) you cough up.
Keep Reading:
Diagnosing Tuberculosis
How to get tested
You can get tested for TB at the health department or at your health care provider's office. Your health care provider will choose the TB test that is best for you. Public and private health care plans may cover TB testing costs.
Finding a test location
Contact your state or local TB program about getting tested for TB.
State TB Programs
Understanding TB blood test or TB skin test results
A positive test result for TB infection means you have TB germs in your body. Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease. These tests may include a chest x-ray, and a test of the sputum (phlegm) you cough up.
A negative test result for TB infection means inactive TB or active TB disease is unlikely, but your health care provider may do more tests, especially if:
You have symptoms of active TB disease, like coughing, chest pain, fever, weight loss, or tiredness.
You have HIV.
You were recently exposed to TB germs.
Keep Reading:
Diagnosing Tuberculosis
What to do if you've tested positive
If your TB blood test or TB skin test is positive, you have TB germs in your body. Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease.
Keep a record of your positive test result
Once you have a positive TB blood test or TB skin test result, you may still have a positive test result on future TB tests. This includes even after you finish taking all of your TB medicine for inactive TB or active TB disease.

Ask your health care provider for a written record of your positive TB test result. This will be helpful if you are asked to have another TB test in the future.

Chemical Emergencies
Riot Control Agents
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that cause irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Riot control agents (also called ""tear gas"") are chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function. It does this by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.
Several different compounds are riot control agents:
Chloroacetophenone (CN)
Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS)
Chloropicrin (PS) - also used as a fumigant
Bromobenzylcyanide (CA)
Dibenzoxazepine (CR)
Combinations of various agents.
Where it is found
Riot control agents are used by law enforcement officials for crowd control. It is also used by individuals and the general public for personal protection (for example, pepper spray).
CS is also used in military settings to test the speed and ability of military personnel to use their gas masks.
How it works
Riot control agents work by causing irritation to the area of contact (for example, eyes, skin, nose) within seconds of exposure.
The effects usually only last 15 to 30 minutes after the person is away from the source and cleaned off.
Signs and symptoms
The level of poisoning depends on the amount someone was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the location of exposure (indoors versus outdoors).
People exposed to riot control agents may experience some or all of the following symptoms immediately after exposure:
Eyes: excessive tearing, burning, blurred vision, redness
Nose: runny nose, burning, swelling
Mouth: burning, irritation, difficulty swallowing, drooling
Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, noisy breathing (wheezing), shortness of breath
Skin: burns, rash
Other: nausea and vomiting
Long lasting exposure or exposure to a large dose may cause severe effects such as:
Blindness
Glaucoma - a serious eye condition that can lead to blindess
Immediate death due to severe chemical burns to the throat and lungs
Respiratory failure possibly resulting in death
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to riot control agents.
Exposure
Riot control agents such as CN and CS are liquids or solids (for example, powders). Therefore, they could be released in the air as fine droplets or particles.
If agents are released into the air, people could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing them in.
What to do if you are exposed
Since breathing in riot control agents is the primary way of exposure, leave the area and get fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing exposure to riot control agents.
If the riot control agents were released outdoors, move away from the area where the agents were released. Stay away from dense, low-lying clouds of riot control agent vapor. Go to the highest ground possible. Riot control agents will form a dense vapor cloud that can travel close to the ground.
If the riot control agents were released indoors, get out of the building.
Evacuate or ""shelter in place""
If you are near a release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas.
Wash your body
Wash any riot control agents from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching unsafe areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Seal or tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
Treatment involves helping the affected person get more oxygen in his or her blood and stopping chemical burns from getting worse. Medications that are used to treat asthma (such as bronchodilators and steroids) may also be used to help the person breathe.
Treating eye exposures involves rinsing the eyes with water until there is no sign of riot control agents in the eyes.
Burn injuries to the skin are treated with standard burn management techniques, including use of medicated bandages.
No antidote exists for poisoning from riot control agents.
Long-term health effects
Long-lasting exposure or exposure to a large amount of riot control agent may cause severe effects such as the following:
Glaucoma (a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness)
Eye scarring
Cataracts
Breathing problems, such as asthma
These effects are more likely if someone was expsoed in a closed setting, such as indoors.
If symptoms go away soon after a person is no longer exposed, long-term health effects are unlikely to happen.

Overview
View LargerDownload
CDC recommends tetanus vaccines for people of all ages.
There are 3 types of combination vaccines that include protection against tetanus:
DTaP
Td
Tdap
The letter ""D/d"" in DTaP and Tdap shows they also help protect against diphtheria. The letter ""P/p"" in DTaP and Tdap shows they also help protect against whooping cough (pertussis).

Tetanus Vaccine Recommendations
Allergies, reactions: Talk with a vaccine provider
Talk to a vaccine provider about your vaccination history and a specific vaccine's ingredients. There may be times when someone shouldn't get DTaP, Td, or Tdap, like if they:
Had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the vaccine(s)
Have a life-threatening allergy to any part of the vaccine(s)
Additionally, discuss with a vaccine provider if a different vaccine other than DTaP or Tdap should be used. A vaccine provider may recommend a different vaccine if someone experienced encephalopathy within 7 days of receiving DTaP or Tdap. Encephalopathy is a brain disease that alters how the brain functions.
Feeling sick?
Generally, vaccination is fine during mild illnesses like a cold. A vaccine provider can advise on whether to get vaccinated or wait until you feel better.
Other guidelines
Tell the vaccine provider if you or your child:
Has seizures or another nervous system problem
Has ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (also called “GBS”)
Had severe pain or swelling after a tetanus or diphtheria vaccine
How well they work
Vaccines that help protect against tetanus work well but protection decreases over time.
Keep Reading:
How Well Tetanus Vaccines Work
Possible side effects
Most people who get a vaccine that helps protect against tetanus don't have any serious problems. With any medicine, including vaccines, there's a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days, but serious reactions are possible.
Mild problems
DTaP vaccine
Swelling or soreness where the vaccine provider gave the vaccine
Fever
Irritability (fussiness)
Feeling tired
Loss of appetite
Vomiting
Td and Tdap vaccines
Pain, redness, or swelling where the vaccine provider gave the vaccine
Mild fever
Headache
Feeling tired
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomachache
More serious reactions
More serious reactions after DTaP vaccination happen much less often than mild problems. They can include:
Seizures
Non-stop crying for 3 hours or more
High fever (over 105°F)
Rarely, DTaP vaccination is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg. While rare, if it happens it's usually in older children when they receive their fourth or fifth shot.

Safety Information for Tetanus Vaccines
Finding and paying for vaccines
Vaccination locations
Children and teens
DTaP and Tdap are part of the routine childhood immunization schedule and regularly available for children at:
Pediatric and family practice offices
Community health clinics
Public health departments
Adults
For adults, a healthcare provider's office or pharmacy are usually the best places to receive recommended vaccines. If your healthcare provider doesn't have Td or Tdap vaccines, ask for a referral.
Federally funded health centers can also provide services if you don't have a regular source of health care. Locate one near you
.
You can also contact your health department to learn more about where to get vaccines in your community.
Vaccine costs
There are several ways to cover the cost of DTaP, Td, and Tdap vaccines:
Private health insurance
Most private health insurance plans cover this vaccine. Check with your insurance provider for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children program
The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program provides vaccines to children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them.

Vaccine Safety
Thimerosal and Vaccines
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS |
KEY POINTS
Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that has been used for decades in the United States in multi-dose vials (vials containing more than one dose) of medicines and vaccines.
There is no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines, except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site.
In July 1999, the Public Health Service agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines as a precautionary measure.
Overview
About thimerosal
Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust, air, soil, and water. Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed — methylmercury and ethylmercury — are very different.
Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic to people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible out of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some methylmercury.
Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body more quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm.
Purpose of thimerosal
Thimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) to prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi.
Introduction of bacteria and fungi has the potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for administration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, serious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added during the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth.
Removal of thimerosal
Fact
Thimerosal was taken out of childhood vaccines in the United States in 2001.
Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines do not and never did contain thimerosal.
Varicella (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal.
Influenza (flu) vaccines are currently available in both thimerosal-containing (for multi-dose vaccine vials) and thimerosal-free versions.
For a complete list of vaccines and their thimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Thimerosal in Vaccines
page.
What the research shows
Fact
Thimerosal use in medical products has a record of being very safe. Data from many studies show no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines.123456
The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people may be allergic to thimerosal.
No connection with autism
Research does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Many well conducted studies have concluded that thimerosal in vaccines does not contribute to the development of autism.135 Even after thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to increase, which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism.
Fact
A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal does not increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1
No association with neuropsychological delays
Studies have assessed the possible association between ethyl mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and neuropsychological functioning including an objective measurement of neuropsychological functioning.
Fact
Research shows no association between thimerosal exposure and neuropsychological delays.24
Timeline: Thimerosal in Vaccines
2010
September 13. Results of a CDC study do not support an association between prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal and an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
2009
February 1. Results of an Italian study
 were reassuring that immunization in infancy with thimerosal-containing vaccines does not decrease neuropsychological performance later in childhood.
2007
September 27. Results of a CDC study
 do not support an association between early exposure to thimerosal in vaccines and neuropsychological problems in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years.
July 7. CDC issues a statement on autism and thimerosal that states in part: “Some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal (from the addition of important vaccines recommended for children) explains the higher prevalence [of autism] in recent years. However, evidence from several studies examining trends in vaccine use and changes in autism frequency does not support such an association.”
2006
September 26. In a statement prepared for the Coalition for Mercury-free Drugs, the FDA concludes that the evidence reviewed by the IOM in 2004 does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.
2004
May 28. ACIP recommends that children between the ages of 6 and 23 months routinely receive an inactivated influenza (flu) vaccine. ACIP does not recommend using the thimerosal-free flu vaccine over the thimerosal-containing flu vaccine, and states that the benefits of flu vaccination outweigh any risk from thimerosal exposure.
May 17. After reviewing over 200 scientific studies that examined thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, IOM concludes in a report
 that the studies “consistently provided evidence of no association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.”
2003
November. A study
 finds no consistent significant associations between exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines and a variety of kidney, nervous system, and developmental problems.
August. Another study
 looks for a link between autism incidence and the use of thimerosal-containing vaccines. The study does not find a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism in Denmark and Sweden, where autism rates continued to increase although thimerosal was removed from vaccines in 1992.
January. The last children’s vaccines that use thimerosal as a preservative expire 
.
2001
Except for influenza (flu), thimerosal is removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and under manufactured for the U.S. market.
October 1. IOM’s Immunization Safety Review Committee issues a report
 concluding there is not enough evidence to disprove claims that thimerosal in childhood vaccines causes autism, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, or speech or language delay.
May 5. A risk assessment
 of thimerosal use in childhood vaccines finds no evidence of harm from the use of thimerosal as a preservative, other than redness and swelling at the injection site.
2000
June 7 and 8. Fifty-one vaccine and vaccine safety researchers and experts meet in Atlanta, GA to review data regarding thimerosal in vaccines and nervous system disorders. A report summarizing the meeting was presented to ACIP.
1999
The FDA reviews
 the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines and finds no evidence of harm, but as a precautionary measure, recommends removing thimerosal from vaccines routinely given to infants.
November 5. CDC states that vaccine manufacturers, FDA, and other agencies are working together to reduce the amount of thimerosal in vaccines, or to replace them with thimerosal-free vaccines, as soon as possible.
October 20. ACIP reviews information about thimerosal in vaccines provided by CDC’s National Immunization Program and several vaccine manufacturers regarding the availability of vaccines that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative.
July 7. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service issue a joint statement that says “There is no data or evidence of any harm caused by the level of exposure that some children may have encountered in following the existing immunization schedule.” The American Academy of Family Physicians issues a comparable statement soon after.
Frequently asked questions
What is thimerosal?
Thimerosal is a vaccine additive, added to some vaccines to prevent germs (like bacteria and fungi) from growing in them. If germs grow in vaccines, they can cause illness—or even death.
Why do some people worry about thimerosal in vaccines?
You may have heard that thimerosal has mercury in it. Not all types of mercury are the same. Some types of mercury, like mercury in some kinds of fish, stay in the human body and can make people sick. Thimerosal is a different kind of mercury. It doesn’t stay in the body, and is unlikely to make us sick.
Is thimerosal safe?
Yes. Thimerosal has been used safely in vaccines for a long time (since the 1930s).
Scientists have been studying the use of thimerosal in vaccines for many years. They haven’t found any evidence that thimerosal causes harm.
Is thimerosal still used in vaccines for children?
No. Thimerosal hasn't been used in vaccines for children since 2001.
However, thimerosal is still used in some flu vaccines. Yearly flu vaccines are recommended for all children. If you are worried about thimerosal, you can ask for a flu vaccine without it.
Does thimerosal cause autism?
No. Research does not show any link between thimerosal and autism.
Keep Reading:
Vaccines and Autism
Are there side effects from thimerosal in vaccines?
Most people don't have any side effects from thimerosal, but some people will have mild side effects like redness and swelling at the place where the shot was given, which will only last 1 to 2 days. It's very unlikely you will have an allergic reaction to thimerosal.
How can I find out if thimerosal is in a vaccine?
Ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Ask to see the vaccine's list of ingredients. All vaccine packages come with information (called an insert) that lists the ingredients.

Thimerosal and Vaccines
What CDC is doing
Fact
CDC and FDA closely monitor the safety of all vaccines.
CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are committed to ensuring that vaccines provided to the public are safe and effective. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized for emergency use in the United States, CDC and FDA continuously monitor them through several safety systems.
Heart Disease
About Aortic Aneurysm
KEY POINTS
An aortic aneurysm is a dangerous balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso.
What it is
Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:
The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms.
A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. An abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is more common, happens below the chest.
Facts about aortic aneurysm in the United States
Aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections were the cause of 9,904 deaths in 2019.1
In 2019, about 59% of deaths due to aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection happen among men.1
A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms.2
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms.3
Types
Thoracic aortic aneurysm
A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age.4
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:
Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back.
Shortness of breath.
Trouble breathing or swallowing.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people.5
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them.6
Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:
Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs.
Other types
Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms—those found in arteries other than the aorta—can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.
Risk factors
Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm.
Other factors include
High blood pressure
High blood cholesterol
Atherosclerosis (hardened arteries)
Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your risk.
Treatment and recovery
The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are medicines and surgery. Medicines can lower blood pressure and reduce risk for an aortic aneurysm. Surgery can repair or replace the affected section of the aorta.

Sore Throat
Sore Throat Basics
KEY POINTS
Is it painful to swallow? Or is your throat scratchy? A virus may be causing your sore throat.
Most sore throats are caused by viruses.
Most sore throats, except for strep throat, do not need antibiotics.
Overview
Viruses, like those that cause colds or flu, are the most common cause of sore throat. These viruses are not strep throat. Sore throat can be a symptom of strep throat, the common cold, allergies or other upper respiratory tract illness. Most sore throats will get better on their own within one week.
A healthy throat and a sore throat, including uvula and tongue, showing inflamed tonsils.
Signs and symptoms
Painful to swallow.
Dry and scratchy throat.
Sore throat caused by a virus or the bacteria called group A Streptococcus can have similar symptoms. Sometimes the following symptoms suggest a virus is causing the illness instead of strep throat:
Cough
Runny nose
Hoarseness (changes in your voice that make it sound breathy, raspy, or strained)
Conjunctivitis (also called pink eye)
Visit the Strep Throat webpage for more information on symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of strep throat.
Causes
Viruses, like those that cause colds or flu, are the most common cause of sore throat. These viruses are not strep throat.
Other causes of sore throat include:
The bacteria group A Streptococcus, which causes strep throat (also called streptococcal pharyngitis).
Allergies.
Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.
Prevention
You can help prevent sore throat by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including:
Clean your hands.
Avoid close contact with people who have sore throats, colds or other upper respiratory infections.
Don't smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.
When to seek medical care
Talk to your healthcare provider if you or your child have symptoms of sore throat. They may need to test you or your child for strep throat.
Also, see a healthcare provider if you or your child have any of the following:
Difficulty breathing.
Difficulty swallowing.
Blood in saliva or phlegm.
Excessive drooling (in young children).
Dehydration.
Joint swelling and pain.
Rash.
Symptoms that do not improve within a few days or get worse.
This list is not all-inclusive. Please see your healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning. Tell your healthcare provider if you or your child have recurrent sore throats.
Talk to your healthcare provider right away
If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider will determine what type of illness you have by asking about symptoms and doing a physical examination. Sometimes they will also swab your throat.
Treatment
If a virus causes a sore throat, antibiotics will not help. Most sore throats will get better on their own within one week. Your healthcare provider may prescribe other medicine or give you tips to help you feel better.
When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.
How to feel better
Suck on ice chips, popsicles or lozenges (do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years).
Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.
Gargle with salt water.
Drink warm beverages and plenty of fluids.
Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older.
Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed.
Over-the-counter medicine and children
Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Some over-the-counter medicines are not recommended for children of certain ages.
Pain relievers:
Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen.
Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye’s syndrome. Reye’s syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain.
Cough and cold medicines:
Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children.
Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child’s healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child.
Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking.

Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
About Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
KEY POINTS
Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria.
Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria: soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF), and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF).
Overview
Relapsing fever is an illness characterized by one or more episodes of fever, headache, and muscle pain that lasts several days and is separated by roughly a week of feeling well. Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria, which are distantly related to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria:
Soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), also known as tickborne relapsing fever
Hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF)
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)
There are differences in how severe the infection can be and where a person may be exposed.

Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus
About Tick-borne Encephalitis
KEY POINTS
Tick-borne encephalitis virus is mainly spread through the bite of an infected tick.
Tick-borne encephalitis is not found in the United States.
Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and weakness.
Disease can be severe.
A vaccine for tick-borne encephalitis is available and is recommended for some travelers.
Overview
Tick-borne encephalitis virus is spread through the bite of an infected tick. Occasionally, tick-borne encephalitis virus can spread to people through eating or drinking raw milk or cheese from infected goats, sheep, or cows.
Tick-borne encephalitis virus can be found in parts of the region stretching from western and northern Europe to northern and eastern Asia. People who travel to these areas might be at risk for infection. Tick-borne encephalitis virus is not found in the United States. The ticks that spread tick-borne encephalitis virus are most active in warmer months (April through November). People who spend time outdoors in or near forests are at highest risk of being bitten by a tick infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus.
Many people infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus do not have symptoms. Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and weakness. Severe disease often occurs including inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).
There are no medications to treat tick-borne encephalitis. A vaccine for tick-borne encephalitis is available and might be recommended for some U.S. travelers who are visiting parts of Europe and Asia where tick-borne encephalitis is found and who might be at risk of exposure to ticks while participating in outdoor activities. You also can reduce your risk of infection from tick-borne encephalitis virus by avoiding ticks.

About Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
KEY POINTS
Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria.
Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria: soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF), and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF).
Overview
Relapsing fever is an illness characterized by one or more episodes of fever, headache, and muscle pain that lasts several days and is separated by roughly a week of feeling well. Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria, which are distantly related to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria:
Soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), also known as tickborne relapsing fever
Hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF)
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)
There are differences in how severe the infection can be and where a person may be exposed.

Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections
FUNGAL DISEASES
Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections Basics
KEY POINTS
Ringworm (dermatophytosis) is a common fungal infection of hair, skin, or nails.
Athlete's foot, jock itch, and most fungal nail infections are forms of ringworm.
On the skin, it usually causes an itchy, red, ring-shaped rash.
Nail infections (onychomycosis) may cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily.
What it is
Ringworm (tinea) is a common fungal infection of the hair (tinea capitis), skin, or nails (onychomycosis). It gets its name from the ring-shaped, itchy, red rash it causes on skin.
Ringworm is more common on certain parts of the body. Ringworm on the feet (tinea pedis) is often referred to as athlete's foot. Ringworm on the groin (tinea cruris) is often called jock itch.
Ringworm is a common type of fungal nail infection (onychomycosis). It can cause nails to change colors, become thick, and break easily. Although infections are much more common in toenails, fingernails can get infected. Fungal nail infections can lead to infections on the skin of the foot.
Health Care Providers:
Clinical Overview of Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections
Health Care Providers:
Emerging Severe and Antimicrobial-Resistant Ringworm
Causes
Ringworm is caused by fungi (not a worm). The scientific names for the most common fungi that cause ringworm are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton.
Ringworm is very common and can be spread by:
Skin-to-skin contact with people or animals with the infection
Shared objects (e.g., towels, bed sheets)
Shared surfaces (e.g., locker room floors)
Risk factors include:
Use of public showers or locker rooms without protective footwear
Participating in contact sports like wrestling
Wearing tight shoes and socks
Excessive sweating
Close contact with animals
Protect Yourself from Ringworm
Help protect yourself and others from ringworm.
Anyone can get ringworm, but people who have weakened immune systems may be especially at risk for infection. They may also have problems fighting off a ringworm infection.
Keep Reading:
What Causes Ringworm
Testing
If you have a rash, nail infection, or symptoms of ringworm, go to a healthcare provider for testing. You may go to your primary care provider, dermatologist, or podiatrist. Symptoms of ringworm are similar to symptoms for other skin or nail conditions. Testing can help make sure you get the right treatment.
Ask your healthcare provider to test for ringworm infections.
Healthcare providers may take a small skin scraping or nail sample for testing.
Treatment
The treatment for ringworm depends on its location on the body and how serious the infection is. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription (over-the-counter) antifungal medications. However, other forms of ringworm need treatment with prescription antifungal medication.
Keep Reading:
Treatment of Ringworm and Fungal Nail Infections
Do not use steroid creams for rashes that could be ringworm.
Steroids (or corticosteroids) are in many over-the-counter creams for rashes. Steroid creams can make ringworm infections worse. If you have a ringworm or a rash that could be ringworm, do not use creams containing steroids.

Tobacco and Cancer
KEY POINTS
Tobacco use can cause cancer almost anywhere in your body.
Overview
Note: This page refers to tobacco products that are made and sold by tobacco companies. It does not include traditional tobacco used by Indigenous groups for religious or ceremonial purposes.
If you were asked to describe the relationship between tobacco and cancer, you might think of lung cancer. It's true that smoking tobacco products (including cigarettes and cigars) causes almost 9 of every 10 cases of lung cancer. But tobacco use can cause cancer almost anywhere in your body, including in the:
Bladder
Blood (acute myeloid leukemia)
Cervix
Colon and rectum
Esophagus
Kidney and renal pelvis
Liver
Lungs, bronchi, and trachea
Mouth and throat
Pancreas
Stomach
Voice box (larynx)
Tobacco use causes cancer throughout the body.
Health advice for people who use tobacco or are thinking of using tobacco
The most important things you can do to avoid health risks from cancer are:
If you don't use tobacco—don't start!
If you do use tobacco—quit!
No matter how long you have used tobacco, quitting can reduce your risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. Many people who use tobacco become addicted to nicotine, a drug found naturally in tobacco. This makes it hard to quit using tobacco. Most people who use tobacco try to quit several times before they succeed. There are proven steps that can help you quit. For more information about quitting tobacco use, go to smokefree.gov.

How tobacco products cause cancer
Tobacco smoke
Smoke from cigarettes, cigars, and pipes has at least 70 chemicals that can cause cancer. Every time you breathe in that smoke, those chemicals get into your bloodstream, which carries the chemicals to all parts of your body. Many of these chemicals can damage your DNA, which controls how your body makes new cells and directs each kind of cell to do what it is made for. Damaged DNA can make cells grow differently from how they are supposed to. These unusual cells can turn into cancer.
Secondhand smoke
People who smoke are not the only people who can get cancer from tobacco smoke. People around them—their kids, partners, friends, coworkers, and others—breathe in that smoke, too, called secondhand smoke.
Smokeless tobacco products
Smokeless tobacco products, such as dipping and chewing tobacco, can cause cancer, too, including cancers of the esophagus, mouth and throat, and pancreas.
Electronic cigarettes
Electronic cigarettes make a mist (often called a cloud) by heating a liquid that contains flavorings and chemicals, many of which are harmful. The liquid usually contains nicotine, the addictive drug in cigarettes and other tobacco products. Users inhale the mist into their lungs. People nearby can also breathe in this mist. E-cigarettes are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women, or adults who don’t use tobacco products.
Health disparities
Differences between groups of people in their level of health, quality of health care, and how many have a particular health problem are called health disparities. The groups of people might differ by age, race, income, rural residence, or some other characteristic. Learn about tobacco-related disparities.

These products can cause nicotine poisoning in children.
Smokeless tobacco is associated with many health problems
Using smokeless tobacco:
Can lead to nicotine addiction.12
Causes cancer of the mouth, esophagus, and pancreas. The esophagus is the passage that connects the throat to the stomach. The pancreas is a gland that helps with digestion and maintaining proper blood sugar levels.12
Is associated with diseases of the mouth, such as leukoplakia and cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx.13
Can increase risks for early delivery and stillbirth when used during pregnancy.2
Can cause nicotine poisoning in children.4
May increase the risk for death from heart disease and stroke.13
Fact
Using smokeless products can cause serious health problems.
Protect your health; don't start. If you do use them, quit.
Addiction to smokeless tobacco
Smokeless tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive.12
Nicotine affects the developing brain.
Nicotine addiction may make it more likely to start using cigarettes.
Young people who use smokeless tobacco may be more likely to also use cigarettes.5
Smokeless tobacco and cancer
Smokeless tobacco causes cancer of the mouth, esophagus, and pancreas.1
Many smokeless tobacco products contain cancer-causing chemicals.16
The most harmful chemicals are tobacco-specific nitrosamines.1 These are organic compounds that may increase the risk of cancer. They form during the growing, curing, fermenting, and aging of tobacco. The amount of these chemicals present varies by product.1
The higher the levels of these chemicals, the greater the risk for cancer.2
Other chemicals found in tobacco can also cause cancer. These include:6
A radioactive element (polonium-210) found in fertilizer used to grow tobacco and which is taken up into the tobacco plant.
Chemicals formed when tobacco is cured with heat (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons—also known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)
Harmful metals (arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, nickel, mercury)
Smokeless tobacco and oral disease
Smokeless tobacco can cause white or gray patches inside the mouth (leukoplakia) that can lead to cancer.1
Smokeless tobacco can cause gum disease, tooth decay, and tooth loss.123
Reproductive and developmental risks
Using smokeless tobacco during pregnancy can increase the risk for early delivery and stillbirth.2
When smokeless tobacco products are used during pregnancy the nicotine can affect how a baby's brain develops before birth.27
Other risks
Using smokeless tobacco increases the risk for death from heart disease and stroke.13
Smokeless tobacco can cause nicotine poisoning in children.4

PARASITES 
About Toxocariasis
KEY POINTS
Toxocariasis is an infection caused by a parasite that spreads to people from animals, usually dogs and cats.
It's also known as ""dog roundworm"" or ""cat roundworm"", after the parasite that causes it.
Many people who are infected don't have any symptoms. But in some people, toxocariasis causes fevers, coughing, or abdominal pain and may damage the eyes.
Most cases of toxocariasis can be treated with drugs.
Overview
Toxocariasis is an infection caused by the parasite Toxocara. It spreads to people from animals, usually dogs or cats. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Toxocariasis is more commonly known as roundworm infection.
Types
People who get infected may have two kinds of toxocariasis:
Ocular toxocariasis, which happens when the parasite gets into the eyes. Ocular toxocariasis can cause eye inflammation, damage to the retina, or vision loss. Typically, only one eye is affected.
Visceral toxocariasis, which happens when the parasite moves into organs like the liver or central nervous system.
Symptoms
Many people infected with Toxocara parasites never develop symptoms or get sick.
In people who have visceral toxocariasis, the most common symptoms include:
Fever
Cough
Wheezing
Abdominal (belly) pain
Enlarged liver
People who have ocular toxocariasis might have:
Irritation or redness of the eye
Seeing spots or flashes of light
Loss of vision
An abnormally colored pupil
Typically, ocular toxocariasis affects only one eye.
How it spreads
Toxocariasis can spread to people through contact with the feces (poop) of dogs and cats with roundworm. Roundworm eggs are carried in animal feces and can get into peoples' mouths through contaminated dirt or unwashed hands.
In rare cases, people may get infected if they eat undercooked or raw meat like lamb or rabbit. But toxocariasis doesn't spread person-to-person like a cold or flu.
Once inside the body, the eggs hatch and the parasites spread. Many people who are infected don't get sick, while others have only mild symptoms. Severe cases are more likely to be in young children who have been playing in or eating contaminated dirt.
Toxocariasis Lifecycle
CDC - DPDx - Toxocariasis
Prevention
Have a veterinarian test and treat your dogs or cats for worms, especially when they are young and if they spend time outdoors. That will make it less likely that people will encounter parasite eggs.
Wash your hands with soap and water after playing with your pets or other animals, after outdoor activities, and before handling food or eating.
Pick up your pet's waste every time. Bury it or bag it and dispose of in the trash. Wash your hands after handling pet waste.
Teach children that it is dangerous to eat dirt or soil.
Diagnosis
Toxocariasis can be hard to diagnose because its symptoms look similar to the symptoms of other infections. If a healthcare provider thinks you might have toxocariasis, they will take a sample of your blood or eye fluid for testing. These tests look for the antibodies your immune system produces when you get infected.
They also may ask if you've been around substances that might have been contaminated with Toxocara eggs, like dirt or pet waste.
Treatment
Most cases of toxocariasis can be treated with drugs that will kill the parasite However, if the parasite has infected an eye, other drugs or surgery may be needed to keep the eye from being damaged.

They also may ask if you've been around substances that might have been contaminated with Toxocara eggs, like dirt or pet waste.
Treatment
Most cases of toxocariasis can be treated with drugs that will kill the parasite However, if the parasite has infected an eye, other drugs or surgery may be needed to keep the eye from being damaged.

Health Care Providers
Overview
Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. It is the leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the United States.
The parasite occurs worldwide and can last for long periods of time (up to a lifetime) in human bodies (and other animals).
People who are pregnant or people who are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system) can take steps to reduce their risk of infection due to Toxoplasma infection causing more serious health problems.
Signs and symptoms
Over 40 million people are infected with the parasite in the United States. Most people with healthy immune systems who get toxoplasmosis do not have symptoms. Those with symptoms may experience flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, and pains.
Severe toxoplasmosis causes damage to the brain, eyes, or other organs.
Ocular (eye) toxoplasmosis can cause damage to the eye. An ophthalmologist treats this type of toxoplasmosis.
Infants infected while still in the womb often have no symptoms at birth but can develop symptoms later in life.
People at risk
Although anyone can become infected with toxoplasmosis, some people need to be more cautious given their health condition, including
People who are pregnant
People who are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system)
People who are at risk for developing severe toxoplasmosis include
Infants born to mothers who are newly infected with Toxoplasma gondii during or just before pregnancy
People who are severely immunocompromised, including those with HIV, those taking certain types of chemotherapy, and those who recently received an organ transplant
Causes
You can become infected with Toxoplasma through the following:
Foodborne transmission: eating contaminated undercooked meat or shellfish or unwashed contaminated fresh produce
Animal to human transmission: accidentally consuming the parasite through contact with cat feces (poop) or contaminated soil that contains Toxoplasma
Mother-to-child (congenital) transmission: when a newly infected mother passes the infection to their unborn child
Other modes of transmission: receiving an infected organ transplant or infected blood via transfusion (though this is rare)
Prevention
Follow these steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected with Toxoplasma gondii:
Food precautions
Use a food thermometer
to cook food to a safe internal temperature
high enough to kill Toxoplasma.
Freeze meat* for several days at sub-zero (0° F) temperatures before cooking to greatly reduce chance of infection.
Rinse fruit and vegetables under running water or cook them.
Do not drink unpasteurized goat's milk.
Do not eat raw oysters, mussels, or clams.
*Cooking meat to recommended internal temperatures is the safest method.
Cleanliness practices
Clean areas where you handle food with hot, soapy water after preparing each food item.
Wear gloves when gardening or touching soil or sand that may be contaminated with cat feces containing Toxoplasma.
Wash hands with soap and water any time you touch something that may be contaminated with cat feces containing Toxoplasma.
If you have a cat, change the litter box daily.
Talk to your healthcare provider about additional precautions if you are a person at risk for severe infection.
Diagnosis
If you think you may have toxoplasmosis, talk to your healthcare provider. They may order different blood tests to help determine if you are infected.
Treatment and recovery
Most people with healthy immune systems do not need treatment. If symptoms occur, they will usually go away within a few weeks to months. If needed, healthcare providers can prescribe treatment.
Animal transmission
Cats play a key role in the spread of toxoplasmosis. Talk to your veterinarian if you have additional questions about your cats and their risk.

Prion Diseases
About Prion Diseases
KEY POINTS
Prion diseases are a family of illnesses that affect people and animals.
These diseases are rare but always lead to death in the person or animal within months to years of symptoms beginning.
There is no treatment or vaccine.
Overview
Prion diseases occur when proteins normally in the body misfold and cause illness. The misfolding leads to brain damage and other symptoms. Symptoms may take years to develop. But once they do, the disease rapidly progresses and leads to death.
Some of the reasons people may get sick with prion diseases is eating or handling meat contaminated with prions. People may also become infected if they get prions in their bodies. This may occur through organ transplant or being exposed to contaminated equipment during surgery.
Types
Prion disease in people
Many different prion diseases affect people, but some are more common than others. The most common prion disease in people is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Another prion disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), has a similar name but is a different, much rarer, disease.
Other prion diseases include kuru, variably protease-sensitive prionopathy, sporadic fatal insomnia, and inherited forms caused by genetic mutations.
CJD
CJD is a prion disease that causes a person's brain to break down or stop working normally. Once symptoms start, the disease progresses quickly. It is always fatal, usually within a year.
CJD is sometimes called ""classic CJD"" to avoid confusion with variant CJD. Most cases of classic CJD are in older people. They appear sporadically. This means there is no known reason that the cases begin.
A smaller number of cases occur in people who inherited genetic changes that make them prone to CJD. Occasionally, there have also been illnesses in people who were exposed to surgical equipment or other products contaminated with prions.
vCJD
vCJD is tied to eating beef from a cow that had a prion disease called Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). It was discovered in 1996 in the United Kingdom.
The disease affected much younger people than CJD. vCJD often infected people their 20s or younger. It caused mental symptoms and behaviors, as well as pain when touching things (dyesthesiasis), that CJD does not.
There have only been four vCJD cases reported in the United States. All occurred in people who were likely exposed to BSE outside the U.S.
Myths and misconceptions
Though they have very similar names, CJD and vCJD are very different. They affect different groups of people and have different causes.
They have different symptoms and affect the body differently. [Table goes here]
How animals are affected
Prion disease in animals
There are a number of known prion diseases in animals. The two most important in the United States are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD).
BSE
BSE is a type of prion disease that affects cows. The first cases were identified in the mid-1980s, but BSE didn't gain widespread attention until a major outbreak in the United Kingdom later that decade into the 1990s. Millions of cows were infected.
By 2005, 24 countries had reported BSE among native cattle. (20 of the 24 were in Europe).
The first BSE case in North America was reported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the United Kingdom. Additional BSE cases were identified in Canada beginning in 2003.
Later that year, a cow in Washington State also tested positive. The cow had come from a Canadian farm prior to being imported into the United States and was likely exposed there. This case remains the only classic BSE case identified in the United States, although cases of atypical BSE have been found.
Experts eventually concluded that the spread of infection in cattle was likely tied to feeding practices. They speculate it began when cows were fed meat and bone meal from other cows that had prion disease.
CWD
CWD is a prion disease that affects animals like deer, elk, moose, and reindeer. It has been found in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Imported cases have also been reported in South Korea. First recognized in Colorado in the late 1960s, CWD has now been identified in 32 U.S. states.
Though there have been no cases of CWD in people, experts think it poses a theoretical risk to people. This is because CWD is related to BSE, which has caused disease in people. If CWD could spread to people, hunters and people who eat meat from CWD-infected animals would likely be most at risk.

Transplant Safety
About Transplant Safety
KEY POINTS
Some organ transplantations are lifesaving procedures. However, serious illness, graft loss, and death can occur from undetected infections in donor organs and tissues.
Laboratorians must test donor organs and tissue for certain bacteria and viruses (for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, and syphilis, to name a few).
Overview
Transplant safety has two categories: organ safety and tissue safety.
Transplant transmitted infections are very rare; public health entities and academic groups suspect about 1% of transplants cause infections and have confirmed cases in far fewer. When these events occur, the complications can include graft failure or death. Efforts to improve transplant safety are ongoing, (for example, improvements to donor screening and donor testing) and informed by investigations of disease transmission from transplanted organs and tissues.
CDC is responsible for surveillance, detection, and warning of potential public health risks within the organ and tissue supply. These public health efforts increase transplant safety by reducing the potential for transmission of communicable diseases.
Fast facts
The most frequently transplanted organs in the United States are the kidney, liver, heart, and lungs. The most commonly transplanted tissues in the U.S. are bones, tendons, ligaments, skin, heart valves, blood vessels, and corneas.
On any given day, there are more than 100,000 people on active waiting lists for organs.
In 2022, there were approximately 15,000 deceased organ donors. On average, they donated 2.5 organs each.
Living donors donate approximately 6,000 organs on average per year.
Surgeons perform about 3.3 million tissue grafts each year and transplant approximately 2.5 million tissue grafts.
Health impacts
Although infrequent, transplants can transmit infections that affect patients' health, including:
Viruses
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Hepatitis C
Rabies virus
West Nile virus and other mosquito-transmitted viruses
Bacteria
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis)
Fungi
Protozoa
Parasites
Amebas
Balamuthia mandrillaris
Frequently asked questions
EXPAND ALL
Can you get sick from a transplant?
How do hospitals acquire organs and tissues?
What are the screening and testing requirements for organ and tissue donation?
What are the reporting and investigation requirements following a suspected infection from transplanted organs or tissue products?
What CDC is doing
CDC helps the healthcare community, state, and local health departments trace diseased organs back to the original donor and identify people who may have received contaminated organs and/or tissue. This process informs regulatory decisions and risk reduction guidance for transplant safety.
CDC laboratories can also help test for and identify bacteria, viruses, etc. that may contaminate organs and tissues.

. Congress established the OPTN under the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984.
The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is a private, non-profit organization operating the OPTN
under contract with HRSA. OPTN data is collected on all deceased and living donors, organ candidates, and organ recipients. To participate in organ recovery and transplantation, organ procurement organizations (OPO) and transplant hospitals must be members of OPTN.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
is a government agency that establishes performance standards for transplant centers and OPOs to determine certification or recertification. Medicare reimbursement is linked to meeting CMS performance standards.
The Association of Organ Procurement Organizations (AOPO)
is a national, non-profit organization offering voluntary accreditation service to its 57 OPO institutional members in the United States and its territories. AOPO helps to ensure compliance with federal regulations and AOPO standards. AOPO also provides education and advocacy for its members.
Tissues
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)
is a federal agency that regulates human tissue, including ocular tissue, for transplantation. Regulations cover all tissue establishments involved in the recovery, processing, storage, and/or distribution of tissue. Healthcare facilities participating in the recovery, processing, or distribution of tissue for transplantation are also required to follow FDA
tissue regulations. All tissue and eye banks must register with and follow FDA
regulations.
The American Association of Tissue Banks

Transportation
Improving Health Through Transportation Policy
KEY POINTS
Transportation can influence quality of life, health, and safety.
Transportation policies and programs can protect and promote health while moving people and goods where they need and want to go.
Overview
Transportation systems can significantly influence quality of life, health, and safety. Good transportation policies and programs protect and promote health while also ensuring easy access for people and goods to reach their destinations.
Opportunity
Transportation improvements can save and improve lives by:
Promoting opportunities for physical activity.
Reducing and preventing motor-vehicle-related injury and deaths.
Improving environmental health.
Expanding everyone's access to safe transportation options can also stimulate economic development and address health disparities.
This work involves transportation professionals, public health, community organizations, employers, government, and others.
The Safe Systems Pyramid
Transportation professionals can use the Safe Systems Pyramid to inform and prioritize interventions and policy. Transportation professionals can also use the pyramid to understand the population health effect of various strategies.1
See example interventions
The Safe Systems Pyramid adds public health ideals to transportation.
Rationale
Improved transportation policies and actions can address several public health concerns, including:
Physical inactivity contributes to people's chances of getting many chronic diseases. These include obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some cancers.
Many Americans view walking and bicycling in their communities as unsafe because of traffic speed and volume as well as the lack of sidewalks, crosswalks, and bicycle infrastructure.
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of injury-related deaths for many age groups. People at greater risk of death from motor vehicle crashes include:
Pedestrians and bicyclists, especially people walking in low-income communities.
Older adults.
People of color.
A lack of efficient alternatives to vehicle travel affects some groups more than others. Those more likely to be affected include:
People with lower incomes.
Older adults.
People with disabilities.
Children.
The lack of efficient transportation can limit access to jobs, health care, social interaction, and healthy foods.
Air pollution from motor vehicles continues to contribute to harmful respiratory and cardiovascular health effects.
Transportation accounts for approximately one-third of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change2.
Transportation strategies can support health and increase access to everyday destinations.
Recommendations
In 2010, CDC published Recommendations for Improving Health Through Transportation Policy. These recommendations specifically consider public health within transportation issues. The recommendations were developed with input from the U.S. Department of Transportation and other partners.
Key recommendations include the following, which may be considered within the Safe Systems framework:
Promote active transportation
Design, build, and maintain active transportation infrastructure that responds to community needs. The built environment can make it safe, easy, and appealing to get to everyday destinations through active transportation. Infrastructure may include roads, sidewalks, bike infrastructure, and public transportation stops.

Strategies for Physical Activity Through Community Design
Encourage healthy community design
Incorporate healthy community design elements to promote health and safety including:
Street pattern design and connectivity.
Pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure.
Public transit infrastructure and access.
Zoning/land use policies.
Multiple sectors can work together to help design communities for health. Sectors can include transportation, community planning, public heatlh, community organizations, schools, and housing.
Keep Reading:
Tools for Action
Expand public transportation
Expand public transportation systems to:
Reduce need for single occupancy vehicle trips.
Reduce automobile emission production.
Increase physical activity.
Improve transportation safety.
Provide necessary transportation access for people with physical, economic, or other limitations.

Reduce injuries associated with motor vehicle crashes
Help prevent injuries and deaths with proven strategies. In the United States, unintentional injuries which include motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death.3 Motor vehicle crashes kill more than 100 people every day.4 However, motor vehicle crash injuries and deaths are preventable.
Keep Reading:
Pedestrian, Bicycle, and Motorcycle Safety
Design to minimize harmful health and safety consequences
Consider conducting health impact assessments and safety audits to avoid creating health and safety problems. They can help to identify and limit potential harmful health or safety effects of a new policy, program, or project.
Require research and surveillance
Use surveillance, research, and evaluation information to determine:
Who is affected by transportation systems.
How transportation systems affect health.
Whether interventions work as intended.
Improve air quality
Limit transportation-related air pollutants that are one of the largest contributors to unhealthy air quality2. Exposure to traffic emissions has been linked to premature deaths, cardiac symptoms, worsening of asthma symptoms, reduced lung function, and hospitalization.

Stress at Work
Traumatic Incident Stress
KEY POINTS
Emergency workers must respond quickly to natural disasters and are at risk of experiencing stress from these traumatic incidents. Symptoms of stress can be physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral.
What is a traumatic incident?
A traumatic incident is one that may involve exposure to
Catastrophic events
Severely injured children or adults
Dead bodies or body parts
Loss of colleagues
Recognizing, monitoring, and maintaining workers health on-site during a traumatic incident can reduce the risk of experiencing stress.
Symptoms of stress
Workers may experience physical, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral symptoms of stress. Some people experience these reactions immediately at the scene, while for others symptoms may occur weeks or months later.
Physical symptoms
Workers experiencing any of the following symptoms should seek IMMEDIATE medical attention:
Chest pain
Difficulty breathing
Severe pain
Symptoms of shock (shallow breathing, rapid or weak pulse, nausea, shivering, pale and moist skin, mental confusion, and dilated pupils)
Workers may also experience the following physical symptoms. If these symptoms occur over time or become severe, workers should seek medical attention. Additional physical symptoms include:
Fatigue/nonspecific aches and pains
Nausea/vomiting
Dizziness/headaches
Profuse sweating
Thirst
Visual difficulties
Clenching of jaw
Cognitive symptoms
If these symptoms occur on the scene workers may not be able to stay clearly focused to maintain their own safety or to rescue injured victims. Workers may experience momentary cognitive symptoms; however, if symptoms are chronic or interfere with daily activities, workers should seek medical attention. These symptoms include:
Confusion
Disorientation
Heightened or lowered alertness
Poor concentration
Poor problem solving
Difficulty identifying familiar objects or people
Memory problems
Nightmares
Emotional symptoms
Strong emotions are ordinary reactions to a traumatic or extraordinary situation. Workers should seek mental health support from a disaster mental health professional if symptoms or distress continue for several weeks or if they interfere with daily activities. Emotional symptoms include:
Anxiety
Guilt
Denial
Grief
Fear
Irritability
Loss of emotional control
Depression
Sense of failure
Feeling overwhelmed
Blaming others or self
Severe pain (rare)
Behavioral symptoms
As a result of a traumatic incident, workers may notice the following behavioral changes in themselves or coworkers:
Intense anger
Withdrawal
Emotional outburst
Temporary outburst
Temporary loss or increase of appetite
Excessive alcohol consumption
Inability to rest, pacing
Change in sexual function
Monitoring and maintaining health
Responders need to take care of their own health to maintain the constant attention they need for their own safety. Responders must be able to stay focused on the job in the dynamic, changing emergency environment. Often responders do not recognize the need to take care of themselves and to monitor their own emotional and physical health. This is especially true if recovery efforts stretch into several weeks. The following guidelines contain simple methods for workers and their team leaders to help themselves and their team members. These guidelines should be read while at the site and again after workers return home.
Control the organization and pace of the rescue and recovery efforts
Pace yourself. Rescue and recovery efforts at the site may continue for days or weeks.
Watch out for each other. Coworkers may be intently focused on a particular task and may not notice a hazard nearby or behind.
Be conscious of those around you. Responders who are exhausted, stressed, or even temporarily distracted may place themselves and others at risk.
Take frequent rest breaks. Rescue and recovery operations take place in extremely dangerous work environments. Mental fatigue, particularly over long shifts, can greatly increase emergency workers' risk of injury.
Maintain adequate nutrition and rest
Eat and sleep regularly. Maintain as normal a schedule as possible and adhere to the team schedule and rotation.
Drink plenty of fluids such as water and juices.
Try to eat a variety of foods and increase your intake of complex carbohydrates (for example, breads and muffins made with whole grains, granola bars).
Whenever possible, take breaks away from the work area. Eat and drink in the cleanest area available.
Monitor mental/emotional health
Recognize and accept what you cannot change—the chain of command, organizational structure, waiting, equipment failures, etc.
Talk to people when YOU feel like it. You decide when you want to discuss your experience. Talking about an event may be reliving it. Choose your own comfort level.
If your employer provided you with formal mental health support, use it!
Give yourself permission to feel rotten: You are in a difficult situation.
Recurring thoughts, dreams, or flashbacks are normal—do not try to fight them. They will decrease over time.
Communicate with your loved ones at home as frequently as possible.
Maintaining health after the incident
Over time, workers’ impressions and understanding of their experience will change. This process is different for everyone. No matter what the event or an individual’s reaction to it, workers can follow some basic steps to help themselves adjust to the experience:
Reach out—people really do care.
Reconnect with family, spiritual, and community supports.
Consider keeping a journal.
Do not make any big life decisions.
Make as many daily decisions as possible to give yourself a feeling of control over your life.
Spend time with others or alone doing the things you enjoy to refresh and recharge yourself.
Be aware that you may feel particularly fearful for your family. This is normal and will pass in time.
Remember that ""getting back to normal"" takes time. Gradually work back into your routine. Let others carry more weight for a while at home and at work.
Be aware that recovery is not a straight path but a matter of two steps forward and one back. You will make progress.
Appreciate a sense of humor in yourself and others. It is okay to laugh again.
Your family will experience the disaster along with you. You need to support each other. This is a time for patience, understanding, and communication.
Avoid overuse of drugs or alcohol. You do not need to complicate your situation with a substance abuse problem.
Get plenty of rest and normal exercise. Eat well-balanced, regular meals.

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Protecting Emergency Response and Recovery Workers
WHAT TO KNOW
Emergency response and recovery workers are a common denominator at any disaster or novel emergency event.
It is critical to protect emergency response and recovery workers' safety and health throughout an emergency.
Response leaders can use these recommendations to help prevent illnesses, injuries, and fatalities during an emergency.
Overview
Preparedness and response activities should address workers' safety and health during all emergency stages, including before, during, and after an event. This helps to ensure that only qualified, trained, and properly equipped personnel are deployed.
Recommendations
Safety managers, incident command leaders, employers, and other disaster site leaders
Information on potential hazards present or expected at a disaster scene helps to establish necessary safety measures. Safety measures are critical to prevent hazards and reduce potential harmful incidents that can occur at the worksite. Examples of safety measures are described below:
Establish a system to manage personnel during an emergency
Provide training to face a particular hazard
Define the use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
Install guidelines and mechanisms to be used in case of an emergency
The Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance (ERHMS) framework provides recommendations for protecting emergency response and recovery workers. Anyone involved in deploying and protecting emergency response and recovery workers can use the framework. ERHMS includes recommendations for all phases of a response, including:
Pre-Deployment
Deployment
Post-Deployment
Recommendations for people responding to disasters and large-scale incidents are described in a series of reports called Protecting Emergency Responders:
Lessons Learned from Terrorist Attacks
Community Views of Safety and Health Risks and Personal Protection Needs
Safety Management in Disaster and Terrorism Response
PPE Guidelines for Structural Collapse Events
Are you an emergency response and recovery worker?
Take steps to protect yourself during a response
What CDC is doing
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) can provide services to people involved in emergency response. Employees, unions, or employers can request an evaluation of possible health hazards associated with a job or workplace. Request an evaluation or email HHERequestHelp@cdc.gov to learn more.
Story from the field
In 2012, NIOSH surveyed emergency response and recovery workers following a vinyl chloride release from a train derailment in New Jersey. The survey was administered to assess:
Experiences from the train derailment
Responder health before and after the vinyl chloride release

Advice for Travelers
Travel Vaccines
Need travel vaccines? Plan ahead.
International travel increases your chances of getting and spreading diseases that are rare or not found in United States. Find out which travel vaccines you may need to help you stay healthy on your trip.
Before Travel
Make sure you are up to date with all of your routine vaccines.
Check CDC’s destination pages for travel health information. Check CDC’s webpage for your destination to see what vaccines or medicines you may need and what diseases or health risks are a concern at your destination.
Make an appointment with your healthcare provider or a travel health specialist that takes place at least 4-6 weeks before you leave. They can help you get destination-specific vaccines, medicines, and information. Discussing your health concerns, itinerary, and planned activities with your provider allows them to give more specific advice and recommendations.
Make sure to bring a copy of your official immunization records with you when you travel.
Because some vaccines require multiple doses, it’s best to see your health care provider as soon as possible.
Medicines to prevent malaria are pills that you start to take before travel. Take recommended medicines as directed. If your health care provider prescribes medicine for you, take the medicine as directed before, during, and after travel.
Where can I get travel vaccines?
You may be able to get some travel vaccines from your primary healthcare provider. If you or your healthcare provider need help finding a location that provides certain vaccines or medicines, visit CDC’s Find a Clinic page.
If yellow fever vaccine is recommended or required for your destination, you’ll need to go to a vaccine center authorized to give yellow fever vaccinations. Many yellow fever vaccine centers also provide other pre-travel health care services. Find an authorized US yellow fever vaccine center.
Examples of Vaccines
Here is a list of possible vaccines that you may need to get for the first time or boosters before you travel.
COVID-19

Pet Travel Safety
WHAT TO KNOW
Plan ahead of time if including pets in your travel plans.
Microchip your pet and make sure your contact information is updated.
Make sure your pet's vaccinations are up to date.
Check regulations and required documentation for your destination before traveling.
Preparing for travel with pets
Owning a pet can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and explore new places. You may want to take your pet with you when you travel to new places. Traveling can sometimes be stressful, both for you and your pets. Preparation can help prevent stress and keep you and your pets safe and healthy.
Before traveling, properly identify your pet in case you get separated during your trip. Make sure your pet is microchipped for identification and keep your contact and pet information updated.
Keeping pets safe in the car
Having a smooth and safe road trip with your pet requires preparation and planning, especially if driving long distances.
To prepare your pet, take them on a series of short drives and gradually increase the amount of time spent in the car.
Before traveling across state lines, check the requirements for bringing pets along.
If your pet is riding on the seat, keep them in the back seat in a harness attached to the seat buckle to prevent injury. Allowing pets to roam around the car or ride with their head outside the window can be dangerous.
If your pet is kept in their crate, check that your pet can stand, sit, lie down, and turn around while inside the crate. Also, make sure the crate is well ventilated. Secure the crate so it won't slide or shift when the car stops.
Bring plenty of water, food, a bowl, leash, waste bags, grooming supplies, medication and first-aid, and any travel documents including proof of rabies vaccination. Feed your pet 3 to 4 hours before leaving on your trip to prevent car sickness or vomiting.
Make frequent stops to allow dogs to go to the bathroom and stretch their legs.
Never leave your pet alone in a parked vehicle. On hot days, temperatures can rise quickly within minutes and can cause death. In cold weather, animals left in cars can freeze to death.
Keeping pets safe on airplanes
Traveling with pets by plane takes careful preparation and planning and could also be costly. If you must bring your pet on a flight, here are suggestions to keep your pet safe:
Weeks before your trip
Book a direct flight when possible to decrease the chances of your pet being separated from you during extreme weather or layovers.
Check your pet's vaccinations to make sure they are up to date. Get a health certificate from your veterinarian dated within 10 days of your departure. For international travel, additional planning and healthcare requirements may be needed. Research the requirements for pets for your destination country
as well as for the United States. When returning to the United States from abroad, your dog must meet all US entry requirements upon return.
For animals stowed in the plane's cargo area, purchase a US Department of Agriculture-approved shipping crate. The crate must be large enough for your pet to stand, sit, and turn around in comfortably.
Before heading to the airport
Line the cargo crate with some type of bedding—shredded paper or towels—to absorb potential accidents. Place a small dish of water in the crate. Check the crate door is securely closed but not locked, so airline staff can open it in case of an emergency.
Your pet's crate should have proper identification if shipped as cargo. Mark ""live animal"" on the crate, and include your name, cell phone, and destination phone number.
At the airport
Before departure or after arrival, give your dog a potty break before securing it in the crate for travel.
On the plane
Keep pets in carriers and follow airline policies when bringing them on planes.
If hand-carried, never place your pet in an overhead bin. Pets must be secured in their crates below the seat in front of you in accordance with airline policies.
International travel with pets
There are several requirements for traveling abroad with pets.
Learn more
Prevent injury and illness when traveling
Keep pets on a leash when traveling to prevent illness and injury.
Practice safe and healthy habits to prevent your pet from getting sick or hurt on trips. Some diseases pets may be at risk for while traveling include rabies, leptospirosis, campylobacteriosis, and diseases spread by mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks like Lyme disease and West Nile virus. Some of these diseases can spread between people and animals.
Always supervise pets while traveling and on adventures.
Keep your pet in a carrier or on a leash.
Don't allow pets to interact with other animals, especially street dogs, stray animals or wild animals.
Don't let pets swim in, play in, or drink stagnant water or water that looks discolored, smells bad, has foam, scum, algal mats, or paint-like streaks on the surface, or has dead fish or other animals washed up on its shore or beach. Some bodies of water contain harmful algal blooms that can make people and pets sick.
Check pets for ticks after outdoor outings and talk to your veterinarian about use of a regular preventive treatment for fleas, ticks, and parasites.
First aid when traveling
Keep basic first-aid supplies for your pet in your car. You can use a travel-sized first-aid kit for your pet on flights.
Keep the phone numbers of your veterinarian, the National Animal Poison Control Center of the ASPCA (1-888-426-4435), and a 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital in the area where you will be visiting, easily accessible.
Perform a daily health check on your pet when away from home to assess their physical and behavioral changes. If you have concerns about your pet, contact your veterinarian or a local veterinarian.
Always remember: follow up any first aid administered to your pet with immediate veterinary care. First-aid care is not a substitute for veterinary care, but it may save your pet's life until veterinary treatment is available.

Medicine and Pregnancy
Medicine and Pregnancy: An Overview
KEY POINTS
Medicine use in pregnancy is common.
If you're pregnant or thinking of getting pregnant, talk to your healthcare providers before starting or stopping any medicines.
Background
Almost all pregnant women face decisions about taking medicines during pregnancy. Many need to take medicines during pregnancy to treat health conditions. In some cases, avoiding or stopping a medicine during pregnancy may be more harmful than taking it.
And yet, certain medicines during pregnancy can increase the risk for health problems, such as some birth defects, prematurity, or pregnancy loss.
What the data shows
Medicine use during pregnancy is common. About 9 in 10 women report taking some type of medicine during pregnancy. About 7 in 10 report taking at least one prescription medicine. From 1997–2018, use of at least one prescription medication in the first trimester increased 35%.12
Safety information is lacking. Fewer than 10% of medicines approved since 1980 have enough information to determine their safety during pregnancy. This is because pregnant women are often not included in studies that determine the safety of new medicines.3
As a result, women and healthcare professionals have limited information to make informed treatment decisions during pregnancy.
Common questions
Is it safe for me to take medicines before I get pregnant?
Many women need to take medicine to stay healthy before and during pregnancy. If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss your current medicines with your healthcare provider. Creating a treatment plan for your health condition before pregnancy can help keep you and your baby healthy.
I took a medicine before I knew I was pregnant. What do I do?
If you're concerned about medicines you took before you knew you were pregnant, talk with your healthcare provider about your concerns. Some medicines can be harmful when taken during pregnancy, but others are unlikely to cause harm. If you're concerned and cannot reach your doctor, contact an expert for free at MotherToBaby
.
Should I trust online information about medicine safety in pregnancy?
Use caution when consulting online sources about medicine safety in pregnancy. Instead, use the information you find to start a conversation with a healthcare professional. Many websites post lists of medicines that are ""safe"" to take during pregnancy. However, for many medicines listed, there is not enough scientific evidence of their safety during pregnancy.
Can I take medicine once I'm no longer pregnant? Can I take medicines if I'm breastfeeding?
Although many medications do pass into breast milk, most have little or no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. For more detailed information, LactRx
is an online database that provides information about managing your health conditions while breastfeeding.
What's being done
CDC and partners study medicine use in pregnancy to understand how specific medicines might affect pregnancy. Results of these studies provide better information on the safety and risks of using specific medicines before, during, and after pregnancy.
This information can help you weigh the risks and benefits of medicines. It can also help you and your healthcare provider make decisions about treatment options.
Keep Reading:
Research on Medicines and Pregnancy
What you can do
Talk to your healthcare providers before starting or stopping any medicines. Be sure to discuss the following with your healthcare providers:
All medicines you take, including prescriptions, over-the-counter medicines, herbal and dietary supplements, and vitamins
Best ways to keep any health conditions you have under control
Your personal goals and preferences for the health of you and your baby
Talk to your healthcare provider about any medicines you take.

Bartonella Infection
About Bartonella
KEY POINTS
Bartonella bacteria are spread to humans by fleas, body lice, sand flies, or contact with flea-infested animals.
There is no evidence that ticks spread Bartonella infection to people.
Cat scratch disease is the most common form of bartonellosis in the United States.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Several species of Bartonella bacteria cause disease in people. Infection with any one of these bacteria is referred to broadly as bartonellosis, although some forms of infection also have common names (for example, cat scratch disease).
For more information:
Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease)
Bartonella quintana infection
Bartonella bacilliformis infection
B. henselae is transmitted by the scratch of domestic or feral cats. Cats can have fleas that carry the bacteria.
B. quintana is transmitted by the human body louse.
B. bacilliformis is transmitted by bites from infected sand flies.
There is no evidence that Bartonella species can be transmitted to people by ticks. Transmission studies with ticks have only used mice and artificial feeding systems which do not demonstrate that a tick can spread bacteria to people or that the bacteria can survive in a tick for any length of time.

Trenching
Trenching and Excavation Safety
KEY POINTS
Workers should never work in an unprotected trench.
A trench can collapse or cave-in at any moment.
Without a protective system in place, a trench collapse can crush and suffocate workers.
Overview
Working in an unprotected trench is dangerous. The walls can collapse suddenly and without warning. When this happens, workers do not have time to move out of the way.
While a small amount of dirt may not seem dangerous, one square yard of dirt can weigh more than 3,000 pounds. This weighs the same as a compact car. This small amount of dirt is enough to fatally crush and suffocate workers.
Injuries and deaths related to trench collapses continue to happen. From the years 2003 to 2017, there were a total of 373 trenching deaths. More than 80% of those deaths happened in the construction industry. Workers do not often survive trench collapses, but we can prevent them.
Workers use a trench box to shield the trench against collapse.
Keeping workers safe
There are ways to prevent trench collapses. Engineering controls, protective equipment, and safe work practices can reduce hazards to workers and prevent trench cave-ins.
Workers should never enter a trench that does not have a protective system in place.
A competent person
should design and install the protective system. A competent person can find hazards and correct them.
Workers can take training to become a competent person. Training is available from many sources, including:
insurance companies,
trade associations,
labor unions, and
companies that make safety equipment for trench workers.
Preventing trench collapses
Planning
To prevent trench collapses, employers must plan before the job begins. Employers should:
Assign and train a competent person.
Call 811 to identify and mark underground utility lines.
Dig a minimum of 5 feet away from utility lines.
Evaluate the soil to determine its stability.
Plan the job layout to identify safe locations for spoil piles and heavy equipment routes.
Before the job starts, if the trench will be 5 feet or deeper, set up a protective system.
If the trench will be 20 feet or deeper, provide engineering protections.
Have a traffic control plan and lane closure permits.
Develop a trench emergency action plan.
OSHA Standard
The OSHA standard for excavations, including trenches, is 29 CFR* 1926 Subpart P
. This standard de­scribes the precautions needed for safe excavation work. OSHA requires that all excavations 5 feet deep or great­er make use of one of the following pro­tective system options:
Sloping the ground
Benching the ground
Shoring the trench with supports (such as planking or hydraulic jacks)
Shielding the trench (using a trench box)
Other Methods
The best way to prevent trench collapse and trenching-related deaths is to use other methods when possible. Some other options include:
directional boring,
relining the pipe,
pipe ramming, and
utility tunneling or pipe jacking.
Robots can be used on construction sites to transport, line, and join large pipes to protect workers from serious injuries. Robots may reduce the need for pipe layers and other helpers to work at the bottom of the trench.
Planning is required before a job starts. Before you dig it, plan it!

Syphilis
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
About Syphilis
KEY POINTS
Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can be cured.
People who are sexually active can get syphilis.
This fact sheet answers general questions about syphilis.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
What is syphilis?
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can cause serious health problems without treatment. Infection develops in stages (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). Each stage can have different signs and symptoms.
Babies can also get syphilis. Congenital syphilis is the disease that happens when women pass syphilis to their babies during pregnancy.
Signs and symptoms
How do I know if I have syphilis?
Each stage of syphilis has different signs and symptoms.
There are four stages of syphilis (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). Each stage has different signs and symptoms.
Primary stage
During the first (primary) stage of syphilis, you may notice a single sore or multiple sores. The sore is the location where syphilis entered your body. These sores usually occur in, on, or around the
Penis
Vagina
Anus
Rectum
Lips or in the mouth
Sores are usually (but not always) firm, round, and painless. Because the sore is painless, you may not notice it. The sore usually lasts 3 to 6 weeks and heals regardless of whether you receive treatment. Even after the sore goes away, you must still receive treatment. This will stop your infection from moving to the secondary stage.
Secondary stage
During the secondary stage, you may have skin rashes and/or sores in your mouth, vagina, or anus. This stage usually starts with a rash on one or more areas of your body. The rash can show up when your primary sore is healing or several weeks after the sore has healed. The rash can be on the palms of your hands and/or the bottoms of your feet and look
Rough
Red
Reddish-brown
The rash usually won't itch, and it is sometimes so faint that you won't notice it. Other symptoms may include
Fever
Swollen lymph glands
Sore throat
Patchy hair loss
Headaches
Weight loss
Muscle aches
fatigue (feeling very tired)
The symptoms from this stage will go away whether you receive treatment. Without the right treatment, your infection will move to the latent and possibly tertiary stages of syphilis.
Latent stage
The latent stage of syphilis is a period when there are no visible signs or symptoms. Without treatment, you can continue to have syphilis in your body for years.
Tertiary stage
Most people with untreated syphilis do not develop tertiary syphilis. However, when it does happen, it can affect many different organ systems. These include the heart and blood vessels, and the brain and nervous system. Tertiary syphilis is very serious and would occur 10–30 years after your infection began. In tertiary syphilis, the disease damages your internal organs and can result in death. A healthcare provider can usually diagnose tertiary syphilis with the help of multiple tests.
Neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis
Without treatment, syphilis can spread to the brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis), the eye (ocular syphilis), or the ear (otosyphilis). This can happen during any of the stages described above.
Signs and symptoms of neurosyphilis can include
Severe headache
Muscle weakness and/or trouble with muscle movements
Changes to your mental state (trouble focusing, confusion, personality change) and/or dementia (problems with memory, thinking, and/or decision making).
Signs and symptoms of ocular syphilis can include
Eye pain and/or redness
Changes in your vision or even blindness
Signs and symptoms of otosyphilis may include
Hearing loss
Ringing, buzzing, roaring, or hissing in the ears (""tinnitus"")
Dizziness or vertigo (feeling like you or your surroundings are moving or spinning)
Risk factors
Am I at risk for syphilis?
Sexually active people can get syphilis through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with a partner who has syphilis.
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for syphilis or other STIs.
Syphilis may be more common in some racial/ethnic and sexual minority groups. For instance, gay and bisexual men are disproportionately impacted by syphilis. In addition, people from racial and ethnic minority groups are experiencing the brunt of the congenital syphilis epidemic. These disparities are due to social, cultural, and economic conditions that make it difficult for sexually active people to stay healthy.
What is the link between syphilis and HIV?
Having a sore or break in the skin from an STI such as syphilis may allow HIV to more easily enter your body. You may also be more likely to get HIV because the same behaviors and circumstances that put you at risk for getting other STIs can also put you at greater risk for getting HIV.
How it spreads
How is syphilis spread?
You can get syphilis by direct contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
Women can also pass syphilis to their baby during pregnancy.
You cannot get syphilis through casual contact with objects, such as
Toilet seats
Doorknobs
Swimming pools
Hot tubs
Bathtubs
Sharing clothing, or eating utensils
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of getting syphilis?
The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting syphilis:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have syphilis.
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex.
Condoms prevent the spread of syphilis by preventing contact with a sore. Sometimes sores occur in areas not covered by a condom. Contact with these sores can still transmit syphilis.
I’m pregnant. If I have syphilis, how can I protect my baby from getting it?
If you are pregnant and have syphilis, you can give the infection to your baby. Having syphilis can lead to a low-birth-weight-baby. It can make it more likely you will deliver your baby too early or stillborn (a baby born dead). To protect your baby, you should receive syphilis testing at least once during your pregnancy. Receive treatment right away if you test positive.
At birth, a baby with a syphilis infection may not have signs or symptoms of disease. However, if the baby does not receive treatment right away, the baby may develop serious problems within a few weeks. These babies can have health problems, such as cataracts, deafness, or seizures, and can die.
Testing and diagnosis
Should I get tested for syphilis?
You should get tested regularly for syphilis if you are sexually active and
Are a gay or bisexual man
Have HIV
Are taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention
Have partner(s) who have tested positive for syphilis
Have certain risk factors for syphilis, like living in a community with high rates of syphilis
All pregnant women should receive syphilis testing at their first prenatal visit. Some pregnant women need to receive syphilis testing again during the third trimester at 28 weeks and at delivery.
How will my healthcare provider know if I have syphilis?
Most of the time, healthcare providers will use a blood test to test for syphilis. Some will diagnose syphilis by testing fluid from a syphilis sore.
Treatment and recovery
Is there a cure for syphilis?
Yes, syphilis is curable with the right antibiotics from your healthcare provider. However, treatment might not undo any damage the infection can cause.
Can I get syphilis again, after receiving treatment?
Having syphilis once does not protect you from getting it again. Even after successful treatment, you can get syphilis again. Only laboratory tests can confirm whether you have syphilis. Follow-up testing by your healthcare provider is necessary to make sure your treatment was successful.
It may not be obvious that a sex partner has syphilis. Syphilis sores in the vagina, anus, mouth, or under the foreskin of the penis, can be hard to see. You may get syphilis again, if your sex partner(s) does not receive testing and treatment.

Trichinellosis (Trichinosis)
PARASITES 
About Trichinellosis
KEY POINTS
People who eat raw or undercooked meat from certain animals can get trichinellosis.
Trichinellosis is a rare disease in the United States, and the risk of getting it is low.
Trichinellosis symptoms can be mistaken for flu symptoms.
Cooking meat to safe temperatures prevents trichinellosis.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Trichinellosis is an infection caused by the larvae of a parasitic worm. Parasites are living things that live on or inside other living things. People get trichinellosis, or trichinosis, after eating raw or undercooked meat that contains the parasite. Usually, meat contaminated with the Trichinella larvae comes from meat-eating animals such as bear, wild boar, or walrus.
Trichinellosis is a rare disease in the United States, with only about 15 confirmed cases per year. Worldwide, there are about 10,000 recorded cases per year. Trichinellosis can cause severe symptoms.
In the past, people in the U.S. often got the disease from eating undercooked or raw pork containing the larvae. Modern regulations on raising commercially farmed pigs and cooking guidelines for pork have helped to lower the risk of trichinellosis in this area.
Signs and symptoms
The signs, symptoms, severity, and duration of trichinellosis can vary. Symptoms often start with
Nausea
Diarrhea
Tiredness
Fever
Abdominal (belly) discomfort
Symptoms can then progress to include
Headache
Fever
Chills
Cough
Swelling of the face and eyes
Aching joints and muscle pain
Itchy skin
Diarrhea
Constipation
If the infection is heavy, you may have trouble coordinating movements, and have heart and breathing problems. Severe cases can cause death.
Risk factors
The risk of getting trichinellosis in the U.S. is very low. People who eat raw or undercooked pork or wild game, in particular, bear, wild boar, wildcat, fox, wolf, seal, or walrus are at risk of getting trichinellosis. Even tasting small amounts of such meat while it's raw or undercooked (like tasting the meat during preparation) puts you at risk for infection with Trichinella worms.
Homemade jerky and sausage made of these meats can also be sources for trichinellosis.
Fact
Trichinellosis does not spread from person to person. You can't give it to another person or get it from them.
Prevention
The best way to prevent trichinellosis is to cook meat to safe temperatures
Use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is properly cooked.
You should also
Wash your hands with warm water and soap before preparing food and after handling raw meat.
Freeze pork less than 6 inches thick for 20 days at 5°F (-15°C) to kill any worms.
Clean meat grinders and all other tools thoroughly after each use.
Be aware that
Curing (salting), drying, smoking, or microwaving meat alone does not consistently kill infective worms. Homemade jerky and sausage were the cause of many cases of trichinellosis reported to CDC in the past.
Freezing wild game meats, unlike freezing pork products, may not effectively kill all worms because some worm species that infect wild game animals are freeze-resistant.
Four steps to Food Safety:
Clean, Separate, Cook, Chill
Diagnosis
If you have trichinellosis symptoms and may have eaten raw or undercooked meat, please speak with your healthcare provider. They may perform a laboratory test using a small sample of your blood to diagnose trichinellosis. Occasionally, a provider may recommend a muscle biopsy, where they look at a sample of your tissue under a microscope to detect trichinellosis.
Treatment and recovery
Safe and effective prescription drugs are available to treat trichinellosis and your symptoms. Treatment should begin as soon as possible. Your healthcare provider will make treatment decisions based on your symptoms, your exposure to raw or undercooked meat, and your laboratory test results.

Trichinellosis does not spread from person to person. You can't give it to another person or get it from them.
Prevention
The best way to prevent trichinellosis is to cook meat to safe temperatures
Use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is properly cooked.
You should also
Wash your hands with warm water and soap before preparing food and after handling raw meat.
Freeze pork less than 6 inches thick for 20 days at 5°F (-15°C) to kill any worms.
Clean meat grinders and all other tools thoroughly after each use.
Be aware that
Curing (salting), drying, smoking, or microwaving meat alone does not consistently kill infective worms. Homemade jerky and sausage were the cause of many cases of trichinellosis reported to CDC in the past.
Freezing wild game meats, unlike freezing pork products, may not effectively kill all worms because some worm species that infect wild game animals are freeze-resistant.
Four steps to Food Safety:
Clean, Separate, Cook, Chill
Diagnosis
If you have trichinellosis symptoms and may have eaten raw or undercooked meat, please speak with your healthcare provider. They may perform a laboratory test using a small sample of your blood to diagnose trichinellosis. Occasionally, a provider may recommend a muscle biopsy, where they look at a sample of your tissue under a microscope to detect trichinellosis.
Treatment and recovery
Safe and effective prescription drugs are available to treat trichinellosis and your symptoms. Treatment should begin as soon as possible. Your healthcare provider will make treatment decisions based on your symptoms, your exposure to raw or undercooked meat, and your laboratory test results.
Trichinellosis (Trichinosis)
PARASITES 
About Trichinellosis
KEY POINTS
People who eat raw or undercooked meat from certain animals can get trichinellosis.
Trichinellosis is a rare disease in the United States, and the risk of getting it is low.
Trichinellosis symptoms can be mistaken for flu symptoms.
Cooking meat to safe temperatures prevents trichinellosis.
MORE INFORMATION

Health Care Providers
Overview
Trichinellosis is an infection caused by the larvae of a parasitic worm. Parasites are living things that live on or inside other living things. People get trichinellosis, or trichinosis, after eating raw or undercooked meat that contains the parasite. Usually, meat contaminated with the Trichinella larvae comes from meat-eating animals such as bear, wild boar, or walrus.
Trichinellosis is a rare disease in the United States, with only about 15 confirmed cases per year. Worldwide, there are about 10,000 recorded cases per year. Trichinellosis can cause severe symptoms.
In the past, people in the U.S. often got the disease from eating undercooked or raw pork containing the larvae. Modern regulations on raising commercially farmed pigs and cooking guidelines for pork have helped to lower the risk of trichinellosis in this area.
Signs and symptoms
The signs, symptoms, severity, and duration of trichinellosis can vary. Symptoms often start with
Nausea
Diarrhea
Tiredness
Fever
Abdominal (belly) discomfort
Symptoms can then progress to include
Headache
Fever
Chills
Cough
Swelling of the face and eyes
Aching joints and muscle pain
Itchy skin
Diarrhea
Constipation
If the infection is heavy, you may have trouble coordinating movements, and have heart and breathing problems. Severe cases can cause death.
Risk factors
The risk of getting trichinellosis in the U.S. is very low. People who eat raw or undercooked pork or wild game, in particular, bear, wild boar, wildcat, fox, wolf, seal, or walrus are at risk of getting trichinellosis. Even tasting small amounts of such meat while it's raw or undercooked (like tasting the meat during preparation) puts you at risk for infection with Trichinella worms.
Homemade jerky and sausage made of these meats can also be sources for trichinellosis.
Fact
Trichinellosis does not spread from person to person. You can't give it to another person or get it from them.

Trichomoniasis
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
About Trichomoniasis
KEY POINTS
Trichomoniasis a common, treatable, sexually transmitted infection (STI)
Most people who have trichomoniasis do not have any symptoms
This fact sheet answers general questions about trichomoniasis
Overview
What is trichomoniasis?
Trichomoniasis (or ""trich"") is a very common STI caused by infection with trichomonas vaginalis (a protozoan parasite). Although symptoms vary, most people who have trich cannot tell they have it.
How common is trichomoniasis?
In the United States, CDC estimates that there were more than two million trichomoniasis infections in 2018. However, only about 30% develop any symptoms of trich. Infection is more common in women than in men. Older women are more likely than younger women to have the infection.
Signs and symptoms
What are the signs and symptoms of trichomoniasis?
About 70% of people with the infection do not have any signs or symptoms. When trich does cause symptoms, they can range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Some people get symptoms within 5 to 28 days after getting the infection. Others do not develop symptoms until much later. Symptoms can come and go.
Men with trich may notice:
Itching or irritation inside the penis
Burning after peeing or ejaculating
Discharge from the penis
Women with trich may notice:
Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals
Discomfort when peeing
A clear, white, yellowish, or greenish vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) with a fishy smell
Having trich can make sex feel unpleasant. Without treatment, the infection can last for months or even years.
What are the complications of trichomoniasis?
Trich can increase the risk of getting or spreading other sexually transmitted infections. For example, trich can cause genital inflammation, making it easier to get HIV, or pass it to a sex partner.
How does trichomoniasis affect a pregnant woman and her baby?
Pregnant women with trich are more likely to have their babies early. Also, their babies are more likely to have a low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds).
How it spreads
How is trichomoniasis spread?
Sexually active people can get trich by having sex without a condom with a partner who has trich.
In women, the infection is most commonly found in the lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, cervix, or urethra). In men, the infection is most commonly found inside the penis (urethra). During sex, the parasite usually spreads from a penis to a vagina, or from a vagina to a penis. It can also spread from a vagina to another vagina.
It is not common for the parasite to infect other body parts, like the hands, mouth, or anus. It is unclear why some people with the infection get symptoms while others do not. It probably depends on factors like a person's age and overall health. People with trich can pass the infection to others, even if they do not have symptoms.
Prevention
How can I prevent trichomoniasis?
The only way to avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting trich:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have trich
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex
Also, talk about the potential risk of STIs before having sex with a new partner. This can help inform the choices you are comfortable taking with your sex life.
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for trich or other STIs.
Testing and diagnosis
How do healthcare providers diagnose trich?
It is not possible to diagnose trich based on symptoms alone. Your healthcare provider can examine you and a laboratory test will confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment and recovery
What is the treatment for trichomoniasis?
Trich is the most common curable STI. A healthcare provider can treat the infection with medication (pills) taken by mouth. This treatment is also safe for pregnant women
If you receive and complete treatment for trich, you can still get it again. Reinfection occurs in about 1 in 5 people within 3 months after receiving treatment. This can happen if you have sex without a condom with a person who has trich. To avoid reinfection, your sex partners should receive treatment at the same time.
You should not have sex again until you and your sex partner(s) complete treatment. You should receive testing again about three months after your treatment, even if your sex partner(s) received treatment.

Soil-Transmitted Helminths
About Soil-transmitted helminths
KEY POINTS
Soil-transmitted Helminths, or STH, are parasitic worms that live in the human intestine.
They spread through soil or water contaminated by human feces (poop) that contain the parasite larvae.
STH infections are considered neglected tropical diseases or NTDs.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities.
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer.
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are:
Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.
Contaminating drinking water sources.
Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.
Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil.
Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.
Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.
Hookworm
You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.
Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.
One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Blood and protein or nutrient loss
Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)
Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections
Wash your hands before handling food.
Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.
Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.
Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or ""preventive chemotherapy"".
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other ""neglected tropical diseases"" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.

Birth Defects
Living with Down Syndrome
KEY POINTS
Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition diagnosed in the United States.
Families and healthcare providers in the United States have learned over time how to improve care for people living with Down syndrome.
Children with Down syndrome are living longer, many into their adult years.
Ongoing, appropriate medical care can help children and adults with Down syndrome live as healthy lives as possible.
Down syndrome in the United States
Each year, about 5,700 babies born in the United States have Down syndrome. This means that Down syndrome occurs in about 1 in every 640 babies.
Life expectancy
The life expectancy of people with Down syndrome increased dramatically between 1960 and 2007.1 In 1960, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 10 years old. In 2007, on average, persons with Down syndrome lived to be about 47 years old.
Many factors can affect how long a person with Down syndrome lives. Babies born with a very low birth weight or a congenital heart defect are less likely to survive their first year.23 There are also racial disparities, with Black infants having a lower survival past the first year. More research is needed to help understand why.
Other health conditions
Between 50 and 65% of all babies born with Down syndrome are also born with a congenital heart defect.24 Babies with Down syndrome can be affected by a wide variety of heart defects. Many of these conditions will need surgery, while some milder conditions might go away on their own as the child grows.
Compared with children without Down syndrome, children with Down syndrome are at higher risk for certain other medical conditions.5 Some of the most common conditions include:
Hearing loss (up to 75% may be affected)
Obstructive sleep apnea, where a person's breathing temporarily stops while asleep (between 50 and 75%)
Ear infections (between 50 and 70% may be affected)
Eye diseases, like cataracts (up to 60%)
Eye issues requiring glasses (50%)
Heart defects present at birth (between 50 and 65%)
Alzheimer's disease
Sleeping Sickness (African Trypanosomiasis)
PARASITES 
About Sleeping Sickness
KEY POINTS
Sleeping sickness, also known as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is a disease caused by a parasite.
You can get the parasite that causes sleeping sickness from the bite of a tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa.
Sleeping sickness is a serious disease. Diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Sleeping sickness (i.e., human African trypanosomiasis or HAT) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Sleeping sickness spreads through the bite of a tsetse fly (Glossina species), found only in rural, sub-Saharan Africa
. The disease causes death if left untreated. There are two types of sleeping sickness. Each one is named for the region in Africa where it was historically found.
Types
There are two types of sleeping sickness:
West African sleeping sickness
Spread by bites from a tsetse fly carrying the parasite T. b. gambiense.
Disease is slow to progress (a few months to a year or more after exposure).
Found in rural parts of Central and West Africa.
The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the number of West African sleeping sickness cases reported
each year to its website.
East African sleeping sickness
Spread by bites from a tsetse fly carrying the parasite T. b. rhodesiense.
Disease progresses in severity very quickly (one to several weeks after exposure).
Found in rural parts of Eastern and Southern Africa and less commonly reported than West African sleeping sickness.
The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the number of East African sleeping sickness cases reported
each year to its website.
Level 1 Travel Notice
CDC has issued a Level 1 travel notice, Practice Usual Precautions, for East African Sleeping Sickness in Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Signs and symptoms
Sleeping sickness occurs in two stages. The first stage typically causes mild, flu-like symptoms. The second stage causes more severe symptoms that affect your brain and central nervous system. Symptoms of each stage take longer to appear in West African sleeping sickness.
If you recently traveled to east or west Africa and were bitten by a tsetse fly, you could have sleeping sickness. Some people who have sleeping sickness develop a red sore, called a chancre, within two days to two weeks of an infected tsetse fly bite but chancres are not always present or noticed.

Symptoms of Sleeping Sickness
Risk factors
Sleeping sickness affects people in rural areas of African countries. Travelers to urban areas in those countries are at low risk.
People at higher risk include:
Hunters
Villagers with infected cattle herds
Tourists visiting and others working in game parks
Tsetse flies that spread sleeping sickness live only in some African countries. Most flies in these rural areas are not carrying the parasite that causes sleeping sickness. However, the more often you are bitten, the more you are at risk of infection.
You cannot contract the disease in the U.S.
How it spreads
You can get sleeping sickness from the bite of an infective tsetse fly.
Occasionally, a pregnant women may pass the parasite Trypanosoma brucei to her unborn baby.
Although rare and not well documented, the parasite may also spread through
Sexual contact
Blood transfusion
Organ transplantation
Accidental laboratory exposure
Prevention
There is no vaccine or drug available to prevent sleeping sickness.
The best way to prevent infection is to prevent bites from the tsetse fly:
Wear protective, neutral-colored clothing, including long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and socks.
Inspect vehicles for tsetse flies before entering.
Avoid bushes.
Use insect repellant.
Read more: Prevent Sleeping Sickness
Diagnosis
There are several tests that can diagnose sleeping sickness. Talk with your healthcare provider right away if you have traveled to rural areas of the countries in Africa where sleeping sickness spreads
and are experiencing any of the symptoms or think you may have sleeping sickness.
Treatment
If diagnosed with sleeping sickness, start medical treatment as soon as possible. Your laboratory results should guide your treatment.
Hospitalization is usually necessary for treatment. Follow-up care may require lumbar puncture (spinal tap) every six months or sooner, if symptoms return, for two years.

Stay safe after a tsunami
After a tsunami, you may face a number of hazards to your health. Know what to do to protect yourself and your loved ones after a tsunami.
Protect yourself from floodwater.
Floodwater and standing water can be dangerous and can make you vulnerable to infectious diseases, chemical hazards, and injuries. Floodwater can also pose a drowning risk for everyone— regardless of their ability to swim. Swiftly moving shallow water can be deadly, and even shallow standing water can be dangerous for small children.
Stay out of floodwater—it can contain many things that can hurt you or make you sick.
Always follow warnings about flooded roads.
Don't drive in flooded areas—cars or other vehicles won't protect you from floodwaters. They can be swept away or may stall in moving water.

Tuberculosis
About Work-related Tuberculosis
KEY POINTS
Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs.
It is caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
It spreads in healthcare and other settings where people gather.
TB is preventable and treatable.
Overview
TB is a risk in healthcare and other congregate settings where people share the same space for extended time. Examples of congregate settings include:
Prisons
Jails
Homeless shelters
Social assistance shelters
Emergency shelters
This disease often spreads when patients, prisoners, or shelter clients have unrecognized TB. It can also spread when people with active disease receive ineffective or incomplete medical treatment.
Risk factors
TB is a contagious and potentially life-threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria spread from person to person through the air. People with symptoms have active TB and can spread the disease. The risk of developing active TB is greatest in the first few years after infection. However, some risk remains throughout life.
Examples of ways people with active TB release bacteria into the air include:
Coughing
Sneezing
Talking
Singing
The small droplets containing the bacteria quickly dry into tiny particles called droplet nuclei. The nuclei can remain suspended in air for long periods of time and other people can breathe the particles into their lungs. Becoming infected with TB typically requires an extended amount of time sharing a space with a person who has active TB. However, in rare cases the infection has been documented after short exposures.
People who have been infected but do not have symptoms have latent TB infection and are not contagious. Once infected, most people's immune system can control the infection. However, they are not able to completely eliminate it without taking a proper course of anti-TB drugs. Depending on the level of infection and strain of bacteria, anti-TB drug regimens can last from 4 months to over a year. Without treatment, latent TB can develop into active TB and become contagious.
TB is preventable and treatable in most cases. It can usually be cured by available anti-TB drugs. Infection control practices can help reduce the spread of TB. Treatment for latent TB infection can prevent others from developing active TB. Persons with drug-resistant strains can recover using alternative regimens of medications, except in extreme cases.
Reducing risk
Using personal protective equipment can help protect against TB.
A TB infection control program should be based on the following three levels of the hierarchy of controls:
Engineering Controls – Isolate people from the hazard.
Administrative Controls – Change the way people work.
Personal Protective Equipment - Incorporate respiratory protection.
The minimum level of respiratory protection acceptable for TB is a NIOSH-approved N95 filtering face piece respirator. For more information on respirators and establishing a respiratory protection program, go to the NIOSH Respirators page.

Testing for Tuberculosis
KEY POINTS
There are two types of tests for tuberculosis (TB) infection: the TB blood test and the TB skin test.
A positive test result for TB infection means you have TB germs in your body.
If you test positive for TB infection, your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB (also called latent TB infection) or active TB disease.
Why get tested
Getting tested and treated for TB can protect yourself, your family and friends, and your community.
You may need a TB test if you have:
Symptoms of TB disease
Spent time with someone who has active TB disease
Factors that put you at higher risk of developing active TB disease
Employment, school, travel, or immigration health screening requirements
You may need a TB test even if you do not feel sick. TB germs can live in your body for years without making you feel sick. This is called inactive TB. People with inactive TB do not feel sick and cannot spread TB germs to others.
Keep Reading:
Treating Tuberculosis
Who should be tested
If you are at higher risk of being infected with TB germs, you should get tested.
You have a higher risk of being exposed to TB germs if you:
Were born in or frequently travel to countries where TB is common, including some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America
Live or used to live in large group settings where TB is more common, such as homeless shelters, prisons, or jails
Recently spent time with someone who has active TB disease
Work in places where TB is more likely to spread, such as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, and nursing homes
Some people who have inactive TB never develop TB disease, and others with inactive TB develop active TB disease months or even years later when their immune system can no longer keep the TB germs from multiplying and growing in the body.
Anyone can get TB, but some people who have inactive TB are more likely to develop TB disease than others.
You have a higher risk of developing TB disease once infected if you:
Have a weaker immune system because of certain medications or health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or HIV
Became infected with TB germs in the last two years
Are a baby or young child, especially under five years of age
Inject illegal drugs
Are sick with other diseases that weaken the immune system
Are elderly
Were not treated correctly for TB in the past
TB tests are generally not needed for people with a low risk of infection with TB germs.
Keep Reading:
Tuberculosis Risk Factors
Types of tests
There are two types of tests for TB infection: the TB blood test and the TB skin test. Ask your health care provider which TB test is best for you.
TB blood test
TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) use a blood sample to find out if you are infected with TB germs. The tests measure how your immune system reacts when a small amount of your blood is mixed with TB proteins.
Tell your health care provider if you received a TB vaccine
Many people born outside the United States have received the TB vaccine (also known as Bacille Calmette-Guérin or BCG).

TB blood tests are the preferred test for people who have received the TB vaccine. Unlike the TB skin test, TB blood tests are not affected by BCG vaccination.
Keep Reading:
Testing for Tuberculosis: Blood Test
TB skin test
For the TB skin test, a health care provider uses a small needle to put some testing material under the skin. You will need to return to your health care provider in two to three days to see if there is a reaction.
Keep Reading:
Testing for Tuberculosis: Skin Test
Other tests may be needed
Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease if you have a:
Positive TB blood test or TB skin test result
Negative TB blood test or TB skin test result, but you have symptoms of active TB disease
These tests may include a chest x-ray, and a test of the sputum (phlegm) you cough up.
Keep Reading:
Diagnosing Tuberculosis
How to get tested
You can get tested for TB at the health department or at your health care provider's office. Your health care provider will choose the TB test that is best for you. Public and private health care plans may cover TB testing costs.
Finding a test location
Contact your state or local TB program about getting tested for TB.
State TB Programs
Understanding TB blood test or TB skin test results
A positive test result for TB infection means you have TB germs in your body. Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease. These tests may include a chest x-ray, and a test of the sputum (phlegm) you cough up.
A negative test result for TB infection means inactive TB or active TB disease is unlikely, but your health care provider may do more tests, especially if:
You have symptoms of active TB disease, like coughing, chest pain, fever, weight loss, or tiredness.
You have HIV.
You were recently exposed to TB germs.
Keep Reading:
Diagnosing Tuberculosis
What to do if you've tested positive
If your TB blood test or TB skin test is positive, you have TB germs in your body. Your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB or active TB disease.
Keep a record of your positive test result
Once you have a positive TB blood test or TB skin test result, you may still have a positive test result on future TB tests. This includes even after you finish taking all of your TB medicine for inactive TB or active TB disease.

Ask your health care provider for a written record of your positive TB test result. This will be helpful if you are asked to have another TB test in the future.

Tularemia is a potentially serious illness caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis.
People can become infected in several different ways, including tick and deer fly bites, and contact with infected animals (especially rodents, rabbits, and hares).
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Tularemia is a disease that can infect animals and people. Rabbits, hares, and rodents are especially susceptible and often die in large numbers during outbreaks. People can become infected in several ways, including:
Tick and deer fly bites
Skin contact with infected animals
Drinking contaminated water
Inhaling contaminated aerosols or agricultural and landscaping dust
Laboratory exposure
In addition, people could be exposed as a result of bioterrorism.
Symptoms vary depending how the person was infected. Tularemia can be life-threatening, but most infections can be treated successfully with antibiotics.
Steps to prevent tularemia include:
Using insect repellent
Wearing gloves when handling sick or dead animals
Avoiding mowing over dead animals
In the United States, naturally occurring infections have been reported from all states except Hawaii.

The U.S. Public Health Service Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee
About The Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee
PURPOSE
The 40-year Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee ended in 1972 and resulted in drastic changes to standard research practices.
Read on to learn about the impact of the study on the lives of those involved.
Background
The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee was a study conducted between 1932 and 1972. The study was supposed to observe the natural history of untreated syphilis. As part of the study, researchers did not collect informed consent from participants. They also did not offer treatment, even after it was easily available. The study ended
in 1972 on the recommendation of an Ad Hoc Advisory Panel. The panel was convened by the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, following publication of news articles about the study.
In 1997, President Clinton issued a formal Presidential Apology
. In his apology he announced an investment to establish what became The National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care at Tuskegee University
. Many records can be found in the National Archives
.

After the study, sweeping changes to standard research practices were made. Efforts to promote the highest ethical standards in research are ongoing today.
Subjects and participation
Tuskegee community members were aware of the study but thought it was a special government health care program1.
According to the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs' Ad Hoc Advisory Panel's published report
, ""...the Macon County Health Department and Tuskegee Institute were cognizant of the study.""
Resource
The National Archives, Southeastern Region, maintains a list of Tuskegee patient medical files
.
The National Archives maintains photos related to the study
.
No women were included in the study. The study was limited to Black men 25 years of age or older. However, as a result of lack of treatment, some women contracted syphilis from men who participated in the study’s syphilitic group.

FAQ
Were men purposefully infected for the study?
No. According to a journal article
about the study, published in 1936, the 399 men in the syphilitic group were initially recruited because they already had late-latent syphilis. The 201 men in the control group did not have the disease.
Why was the U.S. Public Health Service’s Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee unethical?
There is no evidence that researchers obtained informed consent from participants. Also, the participants were not offered available treatments, even after penicillin became widely available.
You can learn more about changes made to standard research practices after Tuskegee in Research Implications.
How much money did the study participants receive from the 1974 out of court settlement?
The $10-million settlement was divided into four categories:
Living syphilitic group participants received $37,500.
Heirs of deceased syphilitic group participants received $15,000.
Living control group participants received $16,000.
Heirs of deceased control group participants received $5,0002.

Typhoid Fever and Paratyphoid Fever


About Typhoid Fever and Paratyphoid Fever
KEY POINTS
Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are life-threatening illnesses.
Each of the illnesses is caused by a kind of Salmonella bacteria (germs).
Most people in the United States with these illnesses were infected during international travel.
You can find out if you need a typhoid fever vaccine at www.cdc.gov/travel.
Overview
Symptoms
Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever have similar symptoms, including fever. The illnesses are life-threatening and people with symptoms should get medical help immediately.
Germs responsible
The illnesses are caused by Salmonella bacteria.
Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella serotype Typhi.
Paratyphoid fever is caused by Salmonella serotype Paratyphi.
Illness estimates
Every year, millions of people around the world get sick from these diseases.
Typhoid fever
9.2 million illnesses are estimated to occur worldwide each year
5,700 illnesses and 620 hospitalizations are estimated to occur in the United States each year. Most people are infected while traveling internationally.
Paratyphoid fever
3.8 million illnesses are estimated to occur worldwide each year
CDC does not have estimates of illnesses and hospitalizations in the United States
Where illness is common
These illnesses are most common in parts of the world where water and food can be unsafe, and sanitation can be poor, including parts of:
Asia (especially Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh)
Africa
Latin America
Most people in the United States with typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever were infected while traveling to these places.
Risk factors
The chances of getting typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever in the United States are very low.
The chances increase for people in the United States who:
Travel to countries in Africa, Asia, or Latin America where the diseases are common
Visit rural areas of those countries
Visit family and friends in those countries
Are not vaccinated against typhoid fever
Almost all people in the United States with these diseases report that they have traveled internationally. Most report that they traveled to countries in South Asia, including Pakistan, India, or Bangladesh.
How it spreads
The bacteria spread to and among people in several ways
The bacteria that cause these illnesses are shed (gotten rid of) in poop. People who shed the bacteria include:
People who have symptoms of typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever
People who are no longer sick but still have the bacteria in their body
You can get typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever after swallowing the bacteria. The bacteria can get in your mouth in several ways, including:
Through food, drinks, and water that have been contaminated by sewage
Through food that has been rinsed in contaminated water and then eaten
Through food that has been touched by a person who did not wash their hands after using the bathroom or changing a diaper
You can take steps to keep safe from these diseases

Global Typhoid Fever Vaccination
KEY POINTS
Typhoid fever vaccines can help prevent and control typhoid fever, in addition to standard prevention measures like clean water access, adequate sanitation, and good hygiene.
CDC works with partners and countries worldwide to support typhoid fever vaccine use in outbreak settings and in national immunization programs.
Typhoid fever vaccines

Typhoid fever vaccines are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)
for use in areas where:
Typhoid fever regularly occurs
Typhoid fever outbreaks are occurring
Different types of typhoid fever vaccines may be used, including typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV).
Compared to other typhoid vaccines, TCV:
is highly effective
offers years of protection
can be used in young children
WHO recommends one dose for people ages 6 months to 45 years in areas where typhoid fever regularly occurs.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Typhoid Fever and Paratyphoid Fever
The need for vaccination is growing
Several strains of the bacteria that cause typhoid fever have become resistant to multiple antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant infections can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat.
Use of TCV can prevent infection, including with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The need for TCV use continues to increase as antibiotic-strains continue to emerge.
How CDC supports typhoid fever vaccine use
CDC works with partners and countries around the world to support TCV use by:
Documenting the burden of typhoid fever and the magnitude of antibiotic resistance for national decision-making
Supporting TCV introduction into national routine immunization programs
Evaluating the best practices for TCV use in outbreak responses
Understanding and addressing barriers to vaccination in countries where typhoid fever regularly occurs
As of December 2023, six countries use TCV in childhood vaccine programs: Liberia, Malawi, Nepal, Pakistan, Samoa, Zimbabwe.
Typhus Fevers
Typhus Fevers Basics
AT A GLANCE
Typhus fevers are a group of diseases caused by bacteria that are spread to humans by fleas, lice, and chiggers.
Typhus fevers include murine typhus, epidemic typhus and scrub typhus.
Fleas spread murine typhus, body lice spread epidemic typhus, and chiggers spread scrub typhus.
The most common symptoms are fever, headaches, and sometimes rash.
Overview
Murine Typhus
Murine typhus, also called flea-borne typhus is a disease caused by the bacteria Rickettsia typhi. Murine typhus is spread to people through contact with infected fleas, most commonly the Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopsis) and the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis).
Keep Reading:
About Murine typhus
Epidemic Typhus
Epidemic typhus, also called louse-borne typhus, is an uncommon disease caused by bacteria called Rickettsia prowazekii. Epidemic typhus is spread to people through contact with infected body lice.
