Chemical Emergencies
Lewisite
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Lewisite is a chemical warfare agent that can cause skin blisters and damage to multiple parts of the body.
Signs and symptoms happen immediately after you are exposed.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Lewisite, known as ""L"" in the military, is a type of chemical warfare agent. It was produced in 1918 to be used in World War I. However, its production was too late for it to be used in the war.
As a vesicant or blistering agent, it causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes (eyes, nose, throat, etc.) on contact.
Lewisite is an oily, colorless liquid in its pure form and can appear amber to black in its impure form. It has a smell like geraniums and contains arsenic, a poisonous element.
Where it is found
Lewisite is not found naturally in the environment. It is used only as a chemical warfare agent and has no medical or other practical use.
How it works
Lewisite is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract.
Because it contains arsenic, lewisite has some effects that are similar to arsenic poisoning, including stomach illness and low blood pressure.
Signs and symptoms
Effects of lewisite depend on the amount people are exposed to, how they are exposed, and how long they are exposed. Most information on the health effects of lewisite is based on animal studies.
Signs and symptoms happen immediately after lewisite exposure. Lewisite has different effects on specific parts of the body.
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to lewisite.
Skin
Pain and irritation can start within seconds to minutes. Within 15 to 30 minutes, redness can begin. Within several hours, blisters can appear. The blister begins as a small blister in the middle of the red areas. The blister then grows to cover the entire reddened area.
The lesions (sores) from lewisite heal much faster than lesions caused by the other blistering agents (sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustards). The discoloring of the skin that occurs later is much less noticeable as well.
Eyes
Signs and symptoms of contact with eyes include:
Irritation
Pain
Swelling
Tearing
Respiratory Tract
Respiratory (breathing) tract signs and symptoms include:
Coughing
Hoarseness
Runny or bloody nose
Shortness of breath
Sinus pain
Sneezing
Digestive tract
Digestive tract signs and symptoms include:
Diarrhea
Nausea
Vomiting
Cardiovascular
Cardiovascular (heart-related system) signs and symptoms include ""Lewisite shock"" or low blood pressure.
Exposure
People's risk for exposure depends on how close they are to the place where the lewisite was released.
Lewisite gas is heavier than air, so it will settle in lower areas. Lewisite is a liquid under a wide range of environmental conditions, from below freezing to very hot temperatures. Therefore, it could last for a long time in the environment.
Air
If lewisite gas is released into the air, people may be exposed through skin contact or eye contact. They may also be exposed by breathing air that contains lewisite.
Food
If lewisite liquid comes into contact with food, people may be exposed by eating the contaminated food.
Water
People may be exposed by drinking water that contains lewisite or by getting the water on their bodies.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get fresh air by leaving the area where the lewisite is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from lewisite.
If lewisite was released outside, move away from the area. Go to the highest ground possible, because lewisite is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas.
If lewisite was released indoors, get out of the building.
If you think you were exposed
Take your clothes off and wash your body. Get medical care as quickly as possible. If you swallowed lewisite, do not force vomiting or drink fluids. Call 911 and tell them what happened.
Take your clothes off
Remove the clothing with liquid lewisite as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head.
If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas and take off the clothes quickly.
Wash your body
As quickly as possible, wash any liquid lewisite from your skin with lots of soap water. Washing with soap and water will protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
If possible, put the clothing in a plastic bag. Then put the first plastic bag in a second plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
If you placed your clothes in plastic bags, tell the local or state health department or emergency personnel when they arrive. Do not handle the plastic bags.
Treatment
Treatment involves removing lewisite from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital.
An antidote (cure for poisons) for lewisite is available and is most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.
Long-term health effects
Breathing in large amounts of lewisite gas may cause long-term respiratory (breathing) disease.
If the eye is exposed for a long time, it may cause permanent blindness.
Lewisite is not known to affect the immune system. Severe skin burning is also less likely.

CDC Activities to Strengthen Safety and Scientific Excellence in CDC Laboratories
Overseeing Safety in CDC Laboratories
CDC is committed to continually improving its culture of safety in its laboratories where transparency and accountability are valued; staff receive complete, comprehensive, and cutting-edge safety training; the safety of a procedure or project is considered before all else; and potential safety issues are quickly and openly addressed.
CDC Lab Worker
While working with dangerous pathogens, chemicals, and toxins always carries a degree of risk, CDC is committed to identifying, mitigating, reducing, and eliminating these risks in every feasible way to protect the safety of its staff and the American public.
The Office of Laboratory Systems and Response (OLSR) oversees biological, chemical, and radiation safety at CDC laboratories. The OLSR safety inspectors visit CDC laboratories annually to ensure that their practices, procedures, and equipment meet key safety standards. The oversight includes ensuring that CDC laboratories are in full compliance with the requirements of the Federal Select Agent Program
, which regulates the possession, use, and transfer of biological select agents and toxins.
The OLSR also manages CDC’s Animal Care and Use Program Office (ACUPO), assuring CDC compliance with guidance and regulations for the responsible care of research animals at CDC.
Providing the Standards and Guidance on Biosafety
CDC co-authors the foundational biosafety manual Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), in partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Now in its 6th Edition, the BMBL has become the standard guidance for biosafety practices in laboratories across the country.
Learn more about the BMBL
Supporting Animal Care and Use in CDC Laboratory Research
CDC has a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that the animals entrusted to our care are treated in accordance with the highest standards of animal welfare and care. Research studies involving animals conducted at or supported by CDC must comply with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) under Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 1-3 as well as the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). As an OLAW Assured institution, all CDC animal studies adhere to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. In addition, all animal studies must be approved by and conducted in accordance with the policies set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), an oversight body mandated by the AWA to review all research studies involving animals at CDC to ensure compliance with animal welfare standards. CDC is also voluntarily accredited with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC), demonstrating CDC’s highest commitment to animal welfare and going above and beyond what is required by federal law.
Learn more about some of the regulatory and ethical standards governing research with animals at CDC
Advancing the “Science of Laboratory Safety”
CDC is committed to advancing the “science of laboratory safety”—applying the same rigorous scientific methods to the safety of CDC’s laboratories that CDC uses to confront threats to the public’s health. To spur the science of safety in CDC laboratories, OLSR supports CDC laboratories to advance innovative research or solutions to laboratory safety challenges.
Advancing Laboratory Scientific Excellence
One of the tenets of CDC's Pledge to the American People is that CDC will ""base all public health decisions on the highest quality scientific data that is derived openly and objectively."" OLSR is committed to ensuring that CDC laboratories continue to fulfill this pledge and serve as a model for scientific excellence and quality.
The scientific data produced by CDC's laboratories provides a crucial foundation for sound, evidence-based public health decision-making across the country. OLSR aids this work by providing CDC laboratories with leadership and technical expertise that both supports, and helps to advance excellence in laboratory science throughout CDC.
OLSR supports this work by providing oversight and coordination of laboratory quality management and training programs for CDC laboratories. OLSR establishes teams responsible for developing agency-level plans, policies, guidelines, manuals, and tools for implementation of quality management programs within Centers, Institutes and Offices, and for the continual improvement of laboratory quality and safety training for CDC staff.
Fostering the Next Generation of Laboratory Leaders
CDC's Laboratory Leadership Service (LLS) is a fellowship program that prepares early career laboratory scientists to become future laboratory leaders. The fellowship combines competency-based public health laboratory training with practical, applied investigations and service. LLS will provide CDC and public health laboratories across the country with a pool of expertly trained laboratory scientists poised to meet the evolving challenges of laboratory science and safety.
Learn more about CDC's Laboratory Leadership Service
Providing State-of-the-Art Laboratory Trainings
Maximizing the safety and impact of CDC's laboratories requires a workforce of laboratory scientists trained in state-of-the-art techniques and technology. In partnership with the Division of Laboratory Systems and Safe Labs Program, OLSR supports the development of a comprehensive training curriculum to ensure that CDC's laboratory scientists are equipped to meet current and future public health challenges.
In 2019, CDC opened a state-of-the-art laboratory training facility where these trainings could be held. The 4,760 square-foot facility was designed to provide hands-on training to laboratory scientists with access to high containment laboratories. This space offers CDC laboratory programs a facility to test new protocols and equipment in a realistic laboratory setting in the absence of pathogens.

Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 6th Edition
AT A GLANCE
Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) has served as the cornerstone of biosafety practice in the United States since its initial release in 1984.
BMBL Foreword
We wish to emphasize that the sixth edition of BMBL remains an advisory document recommending best practices for the safe conduct of work in biomedical and clinical laboratories from a biosafety perspective. The BMBL is not intended to be a regulatory document, although we recognize that some may use it in that way. The core principle of this document is protocol-driven risk assessment; it is not possible for a single document to identify all of the possible combinations of risks and mitigations feasible in biomedical and clinical laboratories. The BMBL should be used as a tool in the assessment and proposed mitigation steps in biomedical and clinical laboratories.
This edition of BMBL includes revised sections, agent summary statements, and appendices. We harmonized the recommendations included in this edition with guidance issued and regulations promulgated by other organizations and federal agencies. Wherever possible, we clarified both the language and intent of the information provided. In order to serve the needs of our community better, this edition includes new appendices on the following topics: inactivation and verification; laboratory sustainability; large-scale biosafety; and clinical laboratory biosafety.
Over 200 of our scientific and professional colleagues contributed to the preparation of the sixth edition through participation in technical working groups and serving as reviewers, guest editors, and subject matter experts. We wish to thank them all for their dedication and hard work. Without them, the sixth edition of BMBL would not be possible. We also recognize the hard work and contributions made by all who participated in preparation of the previous editions of BMBL; we have built on their solid work and commitment.
It would have been impossible to publish this revision without recognizing the visionary leadership of the previous BMBL editors—Drs. John Richardson, W. Emmett Barkley, Jonathan Richmond, Robert W. McKinney, Casey Chosewood, and Deborah Wilson—without whom the BMBL would not be the respected resource it is today. The Steering Committee members, Drs. Christy Myrick, Richard G. Baumann, Margy Lambert, Patricia Delarosa, and Theresa Lawrence, were instrumental in identifying authors, selecting additions to this edition, and reviewing submissions. Their significant contribution to this edition is sincerely appreciated. Dr. Robbin Weyant contributed significantly to the final editing and production efforts.
We are truly grateful to Ms. Shaina Mangino and Dr. Mallory Pomales of Eagle Medical Services, LLC for their expertise and patience in assisting us with this undertaking. Their superb organizational and editing skills were critical in the creation of this document.
We hope you find the sixth edition of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories complete, timely, and most of all, easy to use. Thank you for your patience and understanding during the long and comprehensive revision process.

AT A GLANCE
The Laboratory Leadership Service (LLS) program is a service-learning fellowship that helps fellows hone their laboratory expertise and skills.
LLS promotes interdisciplinary training and applied learning.
Interested applicants should learn about the program and apply.
What the LLS program is
Low Resolution Video
CDC’s Laboratory Leadership Service (LLS) was launched in 2015 to develop future public health laboratory leaders. LLS is a service-learning, multidimensional program that encompasses the competencies of applied public health laboratory research, laboratory operations and quality management, the science of biosafety, bioinformatics, advanced communications, and leadership training. The program guides fellows through 10 core activities of learning (CALs) to help build skill sets in these competency areas deemed critical for success as a laboratory leader. LLS fellows hone their leadership skills and create a culture of scientific excellence in laboratory science by emphasizing high standards in areas such as laboratory quality, safety, and service to protect the public’s health, safety, and security.
LLS is closely aligned with CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) to promote interdisciplinary training, applied learning, and collaboration between laboratory scientists and epidemiologists. LLS provides opportunities for fellows to serve public health agencies and learn through field experiences and domestic or international emergency responses.
How LLS aligns with CDC's mission
CDC’s guiding principles for laboratory work are to ensure the safety of all staff and the community. CDC prioritizes transparency as we conduct high-quality scientific research to promote health and protect people in this country and around the world.
LLS was established as one of multiple efforts to promote lab safety and quality practices and procedures across the agency. A goal of establishing LLS was to strengthen the culture of laboratory quality and safety at CDC. Since its launch, the LLS program has expanded training beyond laboratory quality management and the science of biosafety to also include program management, bioinformatics, advanced communications, and leadership.

Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention
About Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention
KEY POINTS
There are no safe levels of lead in the blood.
Many children ingest lead dust by putting objects such as toys and dirt in their mouths.
The goal of CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) is to prevent childhood lead exposure before any harm occurs.
Overview
Lead is a naturally occurring metal that can cause negative health effects. People are exposed to lead by eating lead paint chips, ingesting contaminated food or water, and/or by breathing in lead dust.
Children younger than 6 years are more likely to be exposed due to their hand-to-mouth behavior. Many children ingest lead dust by putting objects such as toys and dirt in their mouths.
Lead in blood
No safe blood lead level (BLL) in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood are associated with developmental delays, difficulty learning, and behavioral issues. The effects of lead poisoning can be permanent and disabling.
There are steps that parents and healthcare providers can take to protect children from lead exposure. Healthcare providers can perform a blood lead test if a child was or may have been exposed to lead.
CDC uses a blood lead reference value (BLRV) of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL). This reference level helps identify children with BLLs higher than most children's levels. CDC estimates that approximately 500,000 children in the United States have BLLs at or above the BLRV. Healthcare providers can use CDC's Recommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Level to develop a plan of action for their patient. More information about sources of exposure, risk factors, testing and prevention is provided below.
Risk factors
Some children are at a greater risk for lead exposure from paint, water, soil, some imported items and industrial sources. They may also be exposed through their parents and caregivers from certain jobs and hobbies.
Keep Reading:
People at Increased Risk for Childhood Lead Poisoning
Causes
Children can be exposed to lead where they live, learn, and play. Sources of lead exposure can include the following:
Chipping or peeling paint in homes or buildings built before 1978
Water from lead pipes
Soil near airports, highways, or factories
Some imported candies and traditional medicines
Some imported toys and jewelry
Certain jobs and hobbies
Older homes and buildings may be painted with lead-based paint.
Prevention
The goal of CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) is to prevent childhood lead exposure before any harm occurs. Through CLPPP, CDC supports state and local public health departments with funds for surveillance and prevention of lead exposure.
Testing
A blood lead test is the best way to determine if a child has been exposed to lead. Parents can talk to their healthcare provider to find out if a blood lead test is needed. Healthcare providers can recommend follow-up actions and care based on the child's BLL.
To find out if a home has lead, hire a certified lead inspector to test for lead. Visit the Environmental Protection Agency's Lead Abatement, Inspection and Risk Assessment
web page to locate one. Renters can ask their landlord to have the home inspected or to share results of recently conducted lead inspections.

Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires all federal agencies to obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget before collecting information from the public.
Read about the PRA and the enforcement of the act at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Overview
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires that any data collection conducted or sponsored by the federal government complies with its regulations. All Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) programs that engage with the general public to collect information must submit PRA requests to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in order to proceed with data collection activities. The Information Collection Review Office (ICRO) of the CDC facilitates the process of reviewing and submitting PRA requests to the OMB on behalf of all CDC programs.
CDC Paperwork Reduction Act Compliance
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) is a law that requires federal agencies to:
Seek public comment on proposed information collections.
Obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before collecting information from the public.
The PRA grants authority to OMB to review and approve federally conducted and sponsored data collections involving ten or more respondents. The law and its implementing regulation (5 CFR 1320
) reduce the burden placed upon non-Federal entities (the public). The PRA prevents Federal agencies and their programs from collecting unnecessary information.
Goals of the PRA are to:
Minimize the burden on the public when collecting information, especially by using technology.
Maximize the practical use of the information collected.
Ensure that an Information Collection does not duplicate already existing information.
Maximize the cooperation amongst federal program areas and agencies.
Promote openness and accountability in the collection and use of information.
Improve integrity, quality, security, and utility of information to all users within and outside the federal government.
Improve federal responsibility and accountability.

About Body Lice
KEY POINTS
Body lice are parasitic insects that feed on human blood.
Body lice spread by direct contact with others who have them.
Symptoms include itching, rash, and bites.
The only treatment is to improve hygiene and access to clean clothes.
Overview
Body lice are parasites, or insects, that feed on human blood. Body lice can spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. Adult body lice are small, only 2.3 – 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed).
Improved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment needed for body lice infestations; however, in some cases peduculicides are recommended. Body lice can spread disease (epidemic typhus, Bartonella quintana infection, and epidemic relapsing fever).
Symptoms
Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense itching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the skin.
When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become thickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper thighs).
Who is at risk
Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. They affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread quickly in:
People experiencing homelessness
Refugees
Survivors of war or natural disasters
How it spreads
Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with a person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice tends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean clothes.
Nits (lice eggs) take 6 – 9 days to hatch. Nits are tiny (0.8 – 0.3 mm) and hard to see; they can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a pinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per day. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse will die within 1 – 2 days off the host.
Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice.
Prevention
Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice:
Bathe regularly and change into machine-washed clothes at least once a week.
Machine wash and dry infested clothing and bedding using the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle.
Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store for two weeks.
Do not share clothing, beds, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with body lice.
You can fumigate or dust with chemical insecticides to control and prevent the spread of body lice for certain diseases (e.g., epidemic typhus).
Diagnosis
You can diagnose body lice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes you can see a body louse crawling or feeding on the skin.
Although body lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or eggs.
See a healthcare provider if you are unsure about an infestation.
Treatment and recovery
You can treat a body lice infestation by improving personal hygiene. Bathe and change into clean clothes at least once a week. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels used by the person infested with lice using hot water (at least 130°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle.
Pediculicide, a medicine that can kill lice, is sometimes used for treatment. If prescribed a pediculicide, apply it exactly as directed on the bottle or by your healthcare provider. However, a pediculicide is generally not necessary if hygiene is maintained and items are machine washed appropriately at least once a week.
Lice
PARASITES 
About Head Lice
KEY POINTS
Head lice are parasitic insects that usually live on your scalp.
Symptoms include itching, tickling, or sores on your scalp.
Both prescription and over-the-counter medications treat head lice infestations.
Overview
Head lice, or Pediculus humanus capitis, are parasitic insects that feed on human blood. You can find them mostly on your head, but also on your eyebrows and eyelashes. Adult head lice are roughly 2 – 3 mm long (about the size of a sesame seed).
Both over-the-counter and prescription medications are available to treat head lice in your hair (infestation).
Symptoms
People with head lice may not have symptoms, particularly with a first infestation or when an infestation is light. Itching (pruritus) is the most common symptom of head lice infestation. It is caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites. It may take four to six weeks for itching to appear the first time a person has head lice.
Other symptoms may include the following:
A tickling feeling or a sensation of something moving in the hair
Irritability and sleeplessness
Sores on the head caused by scratching, which can sometimes become infected with bacteria normally found on your skin
Head lice do not transmit any disease and therefore are not considered a health hazard.
Who is at risk?
In the United States, infestation with head lice is most common among preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and caretakers.
There is not reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the United States; however, an estimated 6 – 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 – 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head lice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact.
In the United States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African American persons than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the United States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of some types of hair, but not others.
How it spreads
Head lice mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of a person infested with lice. Head lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or fly. Adult lice can live on a person's head for about 30 days. However, they will die within two days if they fall off a person and cannot feed. Adult female head lice are usually larger than males and can lay about six eggs each day. Nits (lice eggs) cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as those found close to the scalp. Nits take about a week (range 6 – 9 days) to hatch into nymphs (young lice). Nymphs look similar to adult lice but are very small (size of a pinhead); they take about seven days to mature into adult lice.
The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. This contact can be common among children playing at places like school or the home. Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of you or your environment.
Although not as common, head lice may spread by:
Wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person
Using infested combs, brushes, or towels
Lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with an infested person
Contracting lice from a wig or hairpiece is extremely unlikely. Especially if the wig or hairpiece hasn't been worn in the past 48 hours by a person with head lice.
Head lice can survive under water for several hours but are unlikely to spread in a swimming pool. Chlorine levels in pool water do not kill head lice.
Animals do not get or spread head lice.
Prevention
Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of head lice:
Avoid head-to-head (hair-to-hair) contact during play and other activities at home, school, and elsewhere (sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camp).
Do not share clothing such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, hair ribbons, or barrettes.
Do not share combs, brushes, or towels. Disinfest combs and brushes used by an infested person by soaking them in hot water (at least 130°F) for 5 – 10 minutes.
Do not lie on beds, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals that have recently been in contact with a person infested with head lice.
Machine wash and dry clothing, towels, bed linens, and other items that a person infested with lice wore or used during the two days before treatment. Use the hot water (130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. If you can't wash or dry clean items, seal them in a plastic bag and store them for two weeks.
Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where the infested person sat or lay. However, spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing.
Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control head lice and can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
To help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, or camp, teach children to avoid activities that may spread head lice. For example, teach children to
Avoid hair-to-hair contact during play.
Not to share clothing such as hats, hair ribbons, barrettes, scarves, coats, or sports uniforms.
Not to share combs, brushes, or towels.
Reminder
CDC's guidance has not changed—you do not need to send students with head lice infestation home early from school. They can go home at the end of the day, be treated, and return to class after beginning appropriate treatment. Nits may stay in hair after treatment, but successful treatment will kill crawling lice.
Diagnosis
Misdiagnosis of head lice infestation is common. Finding a live nymph (baby louse) or adult louse on the scalp or hair is the best way to diagnose a head lice infestation.
Because adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be difficult to find. A fine-toothed louse comb may help you find lice.
If you do not see crawling lice, look for nits attached firmly within ¼ inch of the base of hair shafts. You will often see nits on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than ¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always hatched or dead.
Although head lice and nits can be visible with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or nits. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles.
If you do not see nymphs or adults, and the only nits found are more than ¼ inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and does not need treatment.
How to Examine for Head Lice
If you are not sure if a person has head lice, see your healthcare provider.
Lice
PARASITES 
About Pubic ""Crab"" Lice
KEY POINTS
Pubic lice, also known as ""crab"" lice, are parasitic insects found in the pubic or genital area.
They are usually spread by sexual contact.
Symptoms include itching or visible lice in the genital area.
Both prescription and over-the-counter treatments can treat pubic lice.
Overview
Pubic lice are parasitic insects that feed on human blood. They are short and crab-like and look very different from head and body lice. Pubic lice typically attach to hair in the pubic area. Adult pubic lice are 1.1–1.8 mm in length (size of a pencil tip).
Either over-the-counter or prescription medications can treat pubic lice infestations. Infestation or infested person means that a person has lice.
Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of pubic lice include:
Itching in the genital area
Visible nits (lice eggs)
Lice crawling or attached to pubic hair
Lice in other hairy areas (eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, mustache, armpits, chest, back)
Pubic lice do not transmit disease. However, you could get sores and a bacterial infection from intense scratching.
Who is at risk
Anyone can get pubic lice. Pubic lice usually spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults.
How it spreads
You usually get pubic lice from intimate, person-to-person contact, usually sexual contact. Occasionally pubic lice can spread by clothing, bedding, or (very rarely) using a toilet seat that was just used by a person infested with public lice.
Adult pubic lice are found only on humans and require blood to survive. They will die within 24 – 48 hours without a blood meal. Female adult pubic lice lay about 30 eggs during their 3 – 4-week life span. Eggs hatch after about a week. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) mature into adults over 6 to 9 days.
Animals do not get or spread pubic lice.
Pubic lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication of sexual exposure or abuse.
Prevention
The following are steps that can help prevent and control the spread of pubic (""crab"") lice:
Examine yourself and seek treatment if you experience any of the symptoms of pubic lice or a sexual partner has recently had pubic lice.
All sexual contacts should be examined. All those who are infested should be treated.
Avoid all sexual contact with others until treatment is successful.
Machine wash and dry worn clothing and used bedding by the infested person in the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store them for two weeks.
Do not share clothing, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with pubic lice.
Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control pubic (""crab"") lice. They can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
Diagnosis
Pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a ""crab"" louse or nits on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body. These areas include the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, groin, torso, scalp, or anus. Pubic lice are short and crab-like; they appear very different from head and body lice (I.e., they are broader and flatter than other lice). Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to see them.
Lice found on the head generally are head lice, not pubic lice.
If you are unsure about infestation or if treatment is not successful, see a healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Consider getting tested for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
Treatment and recovery
You can treat pubic lice with a lice-killing lotion containing 1% permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide.
These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription at a local drug store or pharmacy. These medications are safe and effective when used exactly according to the instructions in the package or on the label.

Heart Disease, Family Health History, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia
About Lipoprotein (a)
KEY POINTS
If you have high levels of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), you are more likely to have a heart attack, a stroke, or aortic stenosis, especially if you have familial hypercholesterolemia or signs of coronary heart disease.
High Lp(a) levels run in families.
Current treatments for high Lp(a) are limited.
What it is
High levels of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a), pronounced “L-P-little-A”) increase your likelihood of having a heart attack, a stroke, and aortic stenosis, especially if you have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or signs of coronary heart disease. Cholesterol travels through the blood on lipoproteins, which are made of protein and fat. Lipoproteins include low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and Lp(a).
Effects
High Lp(a) levels increase your likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke, especially if you have FH or signs of coronary heart disease. This is because
Like LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a)-cholesterol can build up in the walls of your blood vessels. The higher your Lp(a) level is, the more likely this is to happen. These cholesterol deposits, called plaques, can decrease blood flow to your heart, brain, kidneys, lungs, legs, and other parts of your body. Plaques can grow over time or suddenly rupture, blocking blood vessels and leading to heart attacks or strokes.1
Lp(a) can cause increased clotting, which can lead to rapidly formed blockages in blood vessels.1
Lp(a) promotes inflammation which increases the likelihood that plaques will rupture.
Because of its role in inflammation, high Lp(a) can also lead to narrowing of the aortic valve, called aortic stenosis.1 Chronic inflammation leads to calcium build up on the valve, causing stiffness. This can result in reduced blood flow if the valve is unable to open completely. In some cases, people with aortic stenosis need surgery or a procedure to replace the aortic valve.
Risk factors
High Lp(a) levels run in families. If one of your family members has high Lp(a), talk to your healthcare provider about having your Lp(a) levels checked. Likewise, if you have high Lp(a), your healthcare provider may recommend that your children, siblings, or parents have their Lp(a) levels checked.
How do I know if I have high Lp(a)?
High Lp(a) levels, defined as greater than 50 mg/dL (125 nmol/L),2 are common. Median Lp(a) levels vary by race and sex.3 High Lp(a) is seen in people of all races and ethnicities but appears to be more common in Black people.3 Many people with high Lp(a) have no symptoms. However, your healthcare provider may suspect that you have high Lp(a) if you have any of the following risk factors:
Poor circulation in your legs (called peripheral arterial disease)
Heart attack, stroke, or coronary artery disease before age 55 (in men) or age 65 (in women) without known risk factors, such as high LDL, smoking, diabetes, or obesity
Female family members who had a heart attack or stroke before age 65
Male family members who had a heart attack or stroke before age 55
Familial hypercholesterolemia
Certain types of aortic stenosis
Your healthcare provider can diagnose high Lp(a) by measuring your blood Lp(a) level and reviewing your personal and family health history. Lp(a) is not routinely included when you get your cholesterol checked. Your healthcare provider has to order the blood test for Lp(a) separately. About a third of people with FH also have high Lp(a) levels, and current recommendations state that people with FH should have their Lp(a) level checked.
Treatment
Lp(a) levels cannot be controlled by healthy eating and exercising. Lipoprotein apheresis is the only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high Lp(a) levels, and it is only approved for people with FH who have LDL≥100 mg/dL, Lp(a)≥60 mg/dL, and coronary or other artery disease. Apheresis is a treatment like dialysis in which a machine removes Lp(a) and LDL-cholesterol from the blood.
If you have high Lp(a) levels, you should take steps to lower your LDL-cholesterol if it is high. Some studies4 suggest that medications called statins might slightly raise Lp(a) levels but are still recommended due to their effects in lowering LDL-cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral arterial disease. If you have FH, coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial disease, your healthcare provider might recommend also taking a medication called PCSK9 inhibitors to further lower your LDL level. While a healthy lifestyle will not lower Lp(a) levels, it does impact LDL levels, so people with high Lp(a) should keep a healthy weight, not smoke, choose healthy foods and drinks, and get regular physical activity. Managing conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure is also important for people with high Lp(a).

Liver cancer is a disease in which cells in the liver grow out of control. The liver is in the upper abdomen near the stomach, intestines, gallbladder, and pancreas. Intrahepatic bile ducts are a network of small tubes that carry bile inside the liver.
The liver does many jobs, including:
Storing nutrients.
Removing waste products and worn-out cells from the blood.
Filtering and processing chemicals in food, alcohol, and medications.
Producing bile, a solution that helps digest fats and eliminate waste products.

Symptoms
In its early stages, liver cancer may not have symptoms that can be seen or felt. However, as the cancer grows larger, people may notice one or more of these common symptoms. It's important to remember that these symptoms could also be caused by other health conditions. If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor.
Liver cancer symptoms may include:
Discomfort in the upper abdomen on the right side.
A swollen abdomen.
A hard lump on the right side just below the rib cage.
Pain near the right shoulder blade or in the back.
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).
Easy bruising or bleeding.
Unusual tiredness.
Nausea and vomiting.
Loss of appetite.
Weight loss for no known reason.
Risk factors
Behaviors and conditions that increase risk for getting liver cancer are:
Being overweight or having obesity.
Having a long-term hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection.
Smoking cigarettes.
Drinking alcohol.
Having cirrhosis (scarring of the liver, which can also be caused by hepatitis and alcohol use).
Having nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (extra fat in the liver that is not caused by alcohol).
Having diabetes.
Having hemochromatosis, a condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs.
Eating foods that have aflatoxin (a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts that have not been stored properly).
Reducing risk
You can lower your risk of getting liver cancer in the following ways:
Keep a healthy weight and get enough physical activity.
Get vaccinated against hepatitis B.
Get tested for hepatitis C, and get medical care if you have it.
Don't smoke, or quit if you do.
Avoid drinking too much alcohol.

Comprehensive cancer control projects
Many comprehensive cancer control plans include liver cancer prevention. Several National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP) recipients have joined projects related to liver cancer prevention. For example:
People who inject drugs are at higher risk of getting hepatitis C and hepatitis B through use of shared equipment. CDC conducted a project to increase awareness of the link between injecting drugs and getting hepatitis and liver cancer. Four NCCCP recipients participated.
In 2019, the NCCCP funded a project to reduce liver, cervical, and skin cancer. The Pennsylvania Comprehensive Cancer Control Program developed materials to educate patients and health care providers about hepatitis B and C screening and hepatitis B vaccination.

PARASITES 
About Liver Flukes
KEY POINTS
Liver flukes are parasites that can infect humans and cause liver and bile duct disease.
There are two families of liver flukes that cause disease in humans: Opisthorchiidae (which includes species of Clonorchis and Opisthorchis) and Fasciolidae (which includes species of Fasciola).
These two families of liver flukes differ in their geographic distribution, life cycle, and long-term outcome after clinical infection.

Liver Flukes
Clonorchiasis (Clonorchis Infection)
Clonorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Clonorchis (also known as Chinese liver fluke disease), is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
You cannot get Clonorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Clonorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).
Fasciola (Fascioliasis Infection)
Fasciola is a liver fluke that can infect the liver and bile duct of exposed people and animals, such as sheep, cattle, goats, and other plant-eating domestic and wild animals.
Fasciola parasites can cause an infectious disease called fascioliasis. Generally, fascioliasis is more common in people who live or work around livestock (e.g., sheep, cattle, goats) in areas where animal infections are common.
Two Fasciola species can infect people:
Fasciola hepatica: the main species that infects people. Other names are ""the common liver fluke"" and ""the sheep liver fluke.""
Fasciola gigantica: a related species that primarily affects domestic and wild animals but can also infect people.
Fascioliasis occurs in all continents except Antarctica, in over 70 countries, especially where there are sheep, cattle, or goats.
In most cases, people can get Fasciola infection by eating raw watercress or other freshwater plants contaminated by larvae.
People can get infected by consuming contaminated water that they drink. People can also get infected by eating vegetables that they washed or irrigated with contaminated water.
People cannot get Fasciola from another person.
Opisthorchis (Opisthorchis Infection)
Opisthorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Opisthorchis is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
There is Opisthorchis viverrini (i.e., the Southeast Asian liver fluke) and O. felineus (i.e., the cat liver fluke).
You cannot get Opisthorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Opisthorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).

About Filarial Worms
KEY POINTS
Filarial worms are a type of microscopic parasitic worm.
They mainly spread through insect bites.
Symptoms from filarial worm infections can be minor (e.g., itching or swelling) but may be severe (e.g., blindness).
There are antiparasitic drugs that can treat filarial worm infections.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Filarial worms are a family of parasites that are found in tropical regions. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Once they infect a person, they can cause diseases that attack different parts of the body.
Symptoms
Symptoms of filarial worm infections range from itching and swelling to disfigurement and blindness. However, many people infected with filarial worms will have no symptoms.
Diseases and common symptoms caused by filarial worms include
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, can cause itchy skin and skin changes and damage the eyes and may lead to blindness.
Lymphatic filariasis, sometimes called elephantiasis, can cause severe swelling of body parts, particularly legs, arms, genital area, and other parts of the body.
Loiasis, also known as Loa loa or African eye worm, can cause itchy, non-painful swellings on limbs or worms that move across the eye.
Mansonellosis, which can cause fever, fatigue, and joint and abdominal (belly) pain.
Causes and spread
Filarial worm diseases affect millions of people a year in Africa, South America, the Pacific islands, and Asia. They spread mostly through the bites of insects like blackflies, mosquitoes, or midges.
Tiny immature worms, known as larvae, will enter a human body when the insect bites into the skin. Once inside a person, they spread throughout the body, grow, and reproduce. When an insect bites an infected person, the insect can ingest the new larvae and eventually infect another person.
Prevention
In most cases, the best way to prevent most filarial worm infections is to avoid insect bites. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using insect repellent on exposed skin, and sleeping under mosquito nets will help prevent insects from biting you.
Treatment
Medications known as antiparasitic drugs can treat new filarial worm infections. In people with advanced disease-causing chronic swelling, surgery or lymphedema care may be needed.
Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are currently the target of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. These campaigns deliver safe and inexpensive drugs aimed at reducing or eliminating transmission of these infections. For some, filaria MDA will reduce symptoms as well. For others, other treatments are needed for symptoms.

Fatigue
About Fatigue and Work
AT A GLANCE
Fatigue can affect anyone and be related to many work-related factors.
Work-related fatigue can affect worker safety and health.
Employers and workers should work together to reduce fatigue risks and manage fatigue.
Overview
In workplace settings, fatigue is commonly associated with nonstandard schedules which disrupt or shorten sleep. Examples of nonstandard schedules include night shift work and extended work hours.
Fatigue can also be associated with other workplace factors, such as:
Stress
Physically or mentally demanding tasks
Working in hot environments
It can stem from several different factors and its effects extend beyond sleepiness.
Fatigue can:
Slow down reaction times
Reduce attention or concentration
Limit short-term memory
Impair judgment
High levels of fatigue can affect any worker in any job. It has serious consequences for worker safety and health.
To keep workers safe and healthy, employers should:
Learn the risks for fatigue-related events.
Identify the sources of fatigue.
Use strategies to prevent and manage fatigue.

About Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
KEY POINTS
Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria.
Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria: soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF), and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF).
Overview
Relapsing fever is an illness characterized by one or more episodes of fever, headache, and muscle pain that lasts several days and is separated by roughly a week of feeling well. Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria, which are distantly related to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria:
Soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), also known as tickborne relapsing fever
Hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF)
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)
There are differences in how severe the infection can be and where a person may be exposed.

Lujo Hemorrhagic Fever
VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
About Lujo Hemorrhagic Fever
KEY POINTS
Lujo hemorrhagic fever (LUHF) is a rare viral disease that is likely spread by rodents.
LUHF is deadly. Up to 80 percent of people with the disease will die.
There is no treatment for LUHF.
There has been one reported outbreak of LUHF, which occurred in Southern Africa.
What it is
Lujo hemorrhagic fever (LUHF) is a disease caused by the Lujo virus. The Lujo virus spreads to people through contact with infected rodents or their urine, droppings, or saliva. Scientists are still learning about LUHF, and do not know which rodent species spreads the virus.
Most knowledge of LUHF comes from the only outbreak, which occurred in 2008. The outbreak began in Zambia when a person became sick after exposure to an infected rodent. This first patient sought care in a South African healthcare facility. There, four healthcare workers caring for the patient also became infected. Four out of the five cases were fatal.
Healthcare providers:
Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like LUHF, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of LUHF resemble those of severe Lassa fever. LUHF starts with fever accompanied by headache and muscle pain.
The disease increases in severity, with:
A rash of the face and torso
Face and neck swelling
Sore throat
Diarrhea
Bleeding is not a typical symptom of LUHF.
In fatal cases, a brief improvement was followed by rapid deterioration, trouble breathing, and problems with the heart and brain/nerves.
Death occurred 10 to 13 days after symptoms began.
How long it takes for signs to show
People with LUHF start experiencing symptoms about 7 to 13 days after they were exposed to the virus.
Risk factors
People who work in fields in southern Africa are at greatest risk for LUHF. They are more likely to have contact with the rodent that spreads the virus. Sexual partners of these field workers may also be at greater risk.
Healthcare providers and laboratory workers without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) are also at risk.
How it spreads
LUHF is caused by infection with the Lujo virus, which is spread by rodents. People usually get LUHF when they are exposed to infected rodents or their urine, droppings, or saliva. This can occur by:
Breathing in air with an infected rodent's urine, droppings, or nesting materials
This may occur when cleaning or sweeping.
Touching objects contaminated by an infected rodent
Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent
Eating food contaminated by an infected rodent
Infection can also happen after a person has contact with bodily fluids of a person with LUHF.
There is a risk of miscarriage during pregnancy.
The Lujo virus can spread in healthcare settings when not using proper PPE or properly sterilizing equipment.
Prevention
If you are in a place where LUHF occurs, avoid areas with rodent infestations or signs of rodent infestation, like droppings.
Healthcare providers should use different PPE depending on the state of the patient:
Use PPE for clinically stable VHF patients if the patient with suspected LUFH is clinically stable.
Use PPE for clinically unstable VHF patients if the patient has confirmed LUHF or is clinically unstable.
Researchers studying Lujo virus must work only in Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories, which have stringent safety and security conditions. In the United States, Lujo virus is classified as a Select Agent.
Keep Reading:
Controlling Wild Rodent Infestations
Testing and diagnosis
If a healthcare worker suspects LUHF, they can perform laboratory tests to diagnose the disease.
Healthcare providers can diagnose LUHF with blood tests that detect the Lujo virus. They can also do antibody tests to tell if someone had the virus in the past. However, these tests should only be done in a high containment laboratory with good laboratory practices.
Clinicians should notify their health department if a patient has recently been in an area with LUHF and has compatible symptoms.
Treatment and recovery
There is no cure for LUHF. Patients should receive supportive care, including rest, hydration, and treatment of symptoms.
The drug Ribavirin may hold promise in the treatment of LUHF.

Cancer Survivors
Lymphedema
WHAT TO KNOW
Cancer or cancer treatment can cause lymphedema. We answer common questions about lymphedema and offer tips for living with lymphedema.
What is lymphedema?
Lymphedema is swelling due to build-up of lymph fluid in the body. Lymph nodes act like a drain in your sink. If the drain is clogged, the fluid cannot drain. It usually happens in the arms or legs, but can occur in other parts of the body. Lymph fluid is part of the lymph system that carries fluid and cells that help fight infections throughout the body. Sometimes this swelling develops quickly, or it may develop slowly over several months.
This photo shows a person with lymphedema in the left leg.
What causes lymphedema?
Lymphedema can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment.
Sometimes a cancerous tumor can get big enough to block the lymph system.
Surgery to remove cancer may also remove lymph nodes or some of the vessels that carry the lymph fluid. This can cause the fluid to build up in surrounding tissues.
Radiation treatment can damage the lymph vessels, resulting in too much lymph fluid in the tissues.
Kathy Bates and Lymphedema
Actor and cancer survivor Kathy Bates talks about lymphedema in this video.
Can lymphedema be prevented?
Before you have surgery or radiation treatment for cancer, ask your doctor what can be done to lower the chances that you will get lymphedema.
What are the symptoms of lymphedema?
The symptoms of lymphedema may include:
Your arm, leg, or other part of your body has a little swelling at first, but gets bigger over time.
The skin in that area feels tight, and sometimes has a tingling sensation.
The arm or leg with lymphedema feels heavy.
Clothing and jewelry fit more tightly on the affected area.
The skin looks thicker or leathery.
If you notice any swelling after cancer treatment, talk to your doctor about what is causing it and how best to treat it.
What health problems can lymphedema cause?
Lymphedema raises your risk of getting an infection in the swollen area. This happens because the cells that prevent infection can't reach that part of your body.
Wounds may heal more slowly on the part of your body that has lymphedema.
You may feel upset, depressed, embarrassed, or angry about the lymphedema.
The joints in the part of the body with lymphedema may feel stiff or sore.
I think I have lymphedema. What should I do?
It is very important to see a doctor right away to find out why you have swelling. You should make sure there is no other cause of the swelling that needs immediate treatment, like a blood clot.
How is lymphedema diagnosed?
First, your doctor will examine you and ask you when you first noticed the problem. If your arm or leg is swollen, your doctor may measure it to compare it with your other arm or leg. Usually, if your swollen arm or leg is 2 cm (about 4/5 of an inch) bigger than your other arm or leg, you have lymphedema.
Your doctor may also suggest other tests to find out if you have lymphedema and if so, what is causing it. Lymphoscintigraphy is a test that uses radioactive material to see if the lymph vessels are blocked. Other x-ray tests may be done to see what is causing the swelling. Computed tomography (CT) scans can take pictures of the swollen area to find out why the lymph vessels are blocked.
How is lymphedema treated?
At this time, there is no cure for lymphedema. The goal of treatment is to reduce the swelling or keep it from getting worse, and to relieve symptoms. Your doctor can help you figure out which treatments are best for you.
Lymphedema can be treated with:
Exercise. Moving your swollen arm or leg may help the lymph fluid to drain, thus reducing the swelling.
A compression sleeve or stocking. This garment fits tightly on your swollen arm or leg, helping the lymph fluid flow out.
Massage therapy. A special kind of massage called manual lymph drainage can help push the lymph fluid out of the swollen part of your body.
A pneumatic pump. A machine inflates a sleeve that you place on your swollen arm or leg, helping lymph fluid flow out.
Weight loss. In patients who are overweight, lymphedema related to breast cancer may improve with weight loss.
Surgery. If your lymphedema is severe, your doctor may suggest that you get an operation. Several options are available.
Cancer treatment. If a cancerous tumor is causing the lymphedema, the cancer is treated.
Tips for living with lymphedema
The keys to managing lymphedema are preventing infections and allowing fluids to flow through the swollen area.
Prevent infections
Keep your skin clean and use lotion to keep it moist.
If you get a small cut, clean it right away and apply antibacterial ointment and a bandage.
Don't get needle sticks (vaccines or blood tests) in the swollen area.
Allow blood and lymph fluid to flow freely
Don't wear tight clothing or jewelry.
If you have lymphedema in one arm, have your blood pressure taken on, and blood drawn from, the other arm.
If your arm or leg is swollen, elevate it above your heart when possible.

Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis
About Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis
KEY POINTS
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis, or LCM, is a disease caused by a virus and spread by the common house mouse, Mus musculus.
Healthy people with LCM usually recover.
LCM can result in serious illness for people who have a weakened immune system and pregnant women.
LCM can occur wherever infected rodents are found.
Some studies show 2 to 5 percent of people living in urban areas have had a past LCM infection.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
LCM is caused by the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. LCM has been reported in Europe, the Americas, Australia, and Japan, and may occur wherever infected rodents are found. LCM is underreported, making it difficult to determine how common it is and where else it is found.
Signs and symptoms
Did you know?
Most healthy people with LCM experience no or only mild symptoms.
People who do get symptoms are usually sick for about a week and may experience:
Fever
Fatigue
Lack of appetite
Muscle aches
Headaches
Nausea
Vomiting
Less common symptoms include sore throat, cough, and pain in the chest, testicles, or glands in the mouth.
After a few days of recovery, a second, more serious phase of illness may occur. This phase involves neurologic distress like a buildup of fluid on the brain and inflammation of the brain, its membranes, and the spinal cord.
Neurologic symptoms can include:
Fever
Headache
Stiff neck
Drowsiness
Confusion
Inability to move
Muscle weakness
How long it takes for signs to show
People with LCM start showing signs of the disease about 8-13 days after being infected with the virus.
Possible complications
Most people with LCM survive. Less than 1 percent of people pass away from the disease.
Even most patients who experience more severe brain symptoms survive. However, temporary or permanent nerve damage is possible. After recovering, some people develop deafness, arthritis, or swelling of the heart.
LCM may pass to the fetus during pregnancy. Infections in the first trimester may result in miscarriage. Infections in the second and third trimesters can cause serious birth defects.
Risk factors
Fact
Anyone who has contact with fresh urine, droppings, saliva, blood, or nesting materials of wild mice is potentially at risk for LCM.
Other people at risk:
Owners of pet mice and hamsters if their pets came from infected colonies or are infected by wild mice.
Laboratory workers who work with the virus or handle infected animals.
Hamsters can spread LCM if they were infected in their colonies or by wild mice.
Risk factors for severe disease:
Immunocompromised people, including organ transplant recipients, are at a higher risk of experiencing fatal hemorrhagic fever-like disease.
70 percent of immunocompromised people infected with LCM will die.
Pregnant women with LCM are at a higher risk for miscarriage.
It is also possible to pass the infection onto the fetus.
Infected newborns can have build-up of fluid deep in the brain, abnormal deposits of calcium in the brain, or swelling in the eye.
70 percent of newborns with these birth defects die. Around 35 percent of all newborns with LCM die.
How it spreads
Someone can get LCM when they are exposed to fresh urine, droppings, saliva, or nesting materials from infected rodents.
Except for transmission to the fetus during pregnancy, spread between people has not been reported. Rarely, someone may contract LCM if they receive an organ transplant from an infected person.
Prevention
You can protect yourself from LCM by avoiding contact with wild mice. Take precautions when handling pet rodents like mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs.

Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers diagnose LCM by testing for the virus or its antibodies in a patient's blood or spinal fluid.
Treatment and recovery
LCM has no treatment. Although some studies have shown the drug ribavirin may be effective against LCM, there is not enough evidence to support its use in all cases.
People who develop neurological symptoms require hospitalization. They may receive anti-inflammatory drugs, like corticosteroids.
