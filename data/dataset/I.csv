ICD-10-CM
WHAT TO KNOW
ICD-10-CM—the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification—is used to code and classify medical diagnoses. ICD-10-CM is based on ICD-10, the system used to code and classify mortality data from death certificates. Use our free tool to search for ICD-10-CM codes.
Introduction
ICD-10-CM (the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) is a standardized system used to code diseases and medical conditions (morbidity) data. Healthcare providers use ICD-10-CM codes when diagnosing patients. ICD-10-CM builds on ICD-10 (the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision)— the system used to code causes of death on death certificates.
CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is responsible for the clinical modification of ICD-10 for use in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO)
, which owns and publishes ICD-10, authorized NCHS to develop ICD-10-CM. All modifications to ICD-10 must conform to WHO's established ICD structure and conventions.

Classification of Diseases, Functioning, and Disability
WHAT TO KNOW
The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) is a worldwide system.
ICD-10 is used to code and classify disease, injury, and death information.
It is made up of several coding systems that standardize medical data.
Classification systems
In the United States, there are two related ICD classifications of diseases with similar titles: ICD and ICD-CM. A third classification, ICF, is related to functioning and disability.
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a standardized system used to code causes of death (mortality) data from death certificates.
The International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-CM) is a standardized system used to code diseases and medical conditions (morbidity) data.
The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) provides standardized information on how disability, health, and environment affect a person's ability to function.

Persons Who Inject Drugs (PWID)
Infectious Diseases in Persons Who Inject Drugs
KEY POINTS
A deadly consequence of the opioid crisis is increased blood-borne infections, including viral hepatitis, HIV, and bacterial and fungal infections.
Infections are spread through contaminated injection drug equipment, unsanitary conditions and low vaccination rates among at-risk populations.
What CDC is doing
A man deposits used syringes into a red disposal container.
CDC's infectious disease programs work to implement evidence-based prevention programs in school and community settings, and to stop the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV among people who inject drugs. Access to comprehensive prevention services is essential for all persons who inject drugs.
Syringe services programs (SSPs) are community-based prevention programs that can provide a range of services, including access to and disposal of sterile syringes and injection equipment, vaccination, testing, and linkage to infectious disease care and substance use treatment. Nearly 30 years of research shows that comprehensive syringe services programs (SSPs) are safe, effective, and cost-saving, do not increase illegal drug use or crime, and play an important role in reducing the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections. Below are a summary of CDC resources on infectious disease and injection drug use.

About Micronutrients
KEY POINTS
Vitamins and minerals, called micronutrients, are critical for healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.
Infants, children, adolescent girls, women of reproductive age, and pregnant women are the most likely groups to have deficiencies.
CDC is working in the United States around the world to improve micronutrient intake.
The problem
Micronutrient deficiencies can have significant consequences on our health and well-being, yet:
Approximately 1 in 4 US women have iron deficiency during pregnancy.
Approximately 1 in 8 US women ages 12 to 49 have iron deficiency.
Globally more than half of children younger than 5 suffer from vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
Learn More
You can learn more about the 6 essential micronutrients and their roles in healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.
What CDC is doing
Through the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO), CDC works in the United States and around the world to:
Identify and monitor iodine, iron, and anemia levels among groups at risk for deficiencies.
Provide practical strategies for feeding healthy foods and drinks to infants and toddlers.
Work with partners to engage pediatricians in advising on the importance of good nutrition practices for young children.
Help countries:
Develop national-level nutrition surveillance systems and national micronutrient surveys.
Design, monitor, and evaluate interventions such as mass food fortification, home fortification, and micronutrient supplementation.
Build laboratory capacity for vitamin and mineral biomarker monitoring. This is in collaboration with the Nutritional Biomarkers Branch in CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences.
Work with global partners to develop guidelines on vitamin and mineral interventions as well as the assessment of anemia and micronutrient status.
By the numbers
Since 2000, DNPAO has provided technical assistance to more than 60 countries.
DNPAO's ongoing and new surveillance efforts will help fill data gaps in the United States and around the world. Countries use this information to inform, develop, monitor, and evaluate policies and programs, especially for women, infants, young children, and adolescents.

About Vaccines and Pregnancy
PURPOSE
Getting vaccinated while you’re pregnant helps your body create protective antibodies you can pass on to your baby. These antibodies can help protect your baby from those diseases during the first few months of life.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Things to Know
1. You aren't just protecting yourself—vaccines during pregnancy give your baby some early protection too!
Did you know a baby can get some disease protection from their mom during pregnancy? Getting flu, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19 vaccines while you're pregnant helps your body create protective antibodies (proteins produced by the body to fight off diseases), and you can pass on those antibodies to your baby. These antibodies can help protect your baby from those diseases during the first few months of life.
Vaccines during pregnancy give your baby some early protection too.
2. Flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccination while pregnant can help keep you and your little one safe.
CDC and a panel of experts who make vaccine recommendations have concluded that flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant women and their babies. These experts carefully reviewed the available safety data before recommending any vaccines during pregnancy.
Vaccines, like medicine, can have side effects. But most people who get vaccinated have mild or no side effects. CDC continually monitors vaccine safety, and the most common side effects of these vaccines include fever, tiredness, and body aches, as well as redness, swelling, and tenderness at the site where the shot was given.
Flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant women and their babies.
3. The Tdap vaccine helps protect against whooping cough, which can be really dangerous for your baby.
You'll need a Tdap vaccine during your pregnancy, with optimal timing between the 27th through 36th week of each pregnancy, preferably during the earlier part of this time period. Tdap helps protect against whooping cough (pertussis), which can be life-threatening for newborns.
About half of babies younger than 1 year old who get whooping cough need treatment in the hospital. The younger a baby is when they get whooping cough, the more likely the baby will need to be treated in a hospital. While some babies cough a lot, other babies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead, it can cause them to stop breathing and turn blue. Siblings, parents, or caregivers who don't know they have whooping cough can infect babies since the disease often causes only mild symptoms in older children and adults.
Tdap helps protect against whooping cough (pertussis), which can be life-threatening for newborns.
4. Getting a flu vaccine while pregnant can help protect you and your baby against flu.
Changes in your immune, heart, and lung functions during pregnancy make you more likely to get seriously ill from flu. Pregnancy increases the risk of being hospitalized with the flu and having flu-related complications if you get sick with the flu. Flu may also be dangerous for your pregnancy. Fever during pregnancy, for any reason, has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Additionally, babies are more likely to get very sick from flu. Flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. When you get a flu vaccine during pregnancy, you pass antibodies along to your baby that can help protect them from flu in the first few months after they're born, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves.
Get a flu shot if you are pregnant during flu season—it's the best way to protect yourself and your baby from flu. Flu vaccine is safe during pregnancy and can be given during any trimester.
When you get a flu vaccine during pregnancy, you pass antibodies along to your baby that can help protect them from flu in the first few months after they're born.
5. Getting an RSV vaccine during your pregnancy or getting your baby an RSV immunization can help protect your baby
RSV is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants. Babies infected with RSV can have difficulty breathing and eating and sometimes may need respiratory support or hydration in the hospital. There are two ways to protect your baby from getting very sick with RSV. You can choose to get RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of your pregnancy during September to January, or your baby aged 8 months or younger can get RSV immunization during their first RSV season.
Getting an RSV vaccine during your pregnancy or getting your baby an RSV immunization can help protect your baby.
6. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant can help protect you and your baby from getting very sick from COVID-19.
If you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 than women who are not pregnant. Additionally, if you have COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are more likely to have complications that can affect your pregnancy and developing baby.
COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, including women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future. Evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe and effective and suggests that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential risks. New data show that vaccination during pregnancy can help protect babies younger than 6 months old, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves, from hospitalization due to COVID-19.
Everyone, including women who are pregnant, should stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines, including getting an updated vaccine when it's time to get one.
COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, including women who are pregnant or might become pregnant in the future.
7. Timing of vaccinations is everything!
You know all about timing. Week after week, you are tracking your baby's growth and development and counting down the days until you meet your little one! When it comes to vaccines, timing is also important.
Flu seasons vary in their timing from season to season. For most people, CDC recommends getting the flu vaccine in September or October to ensure that they are protected before flu activity begins to increase. Early vaccination during July and August also can be considered for women who are in the third trimester of pregnancy during those months.
Instead of during a specific time of year, CDC recommends you get your Tdap vaccine in each pregnancy, ideally between the 27th and 36th week. Getting Tdap during this period preferably during the earlier part, helps pass the greatest amount of protective antibodies to your baby before birth. This will help protect your baby during their first few months of life when they are most vulnerable to serious disease and complications.
You can get your RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy during September to January, or your baby aged 8 months or younger can get RSV immunization during their first RSV season.
You can get your updated COVID-19 vaccine at any point in pregnancy.
When it comes to vaccines, timing is important.
8. Anyone who is around your baby needs vaccines too.
Newborns do not yet have fully developed immune systems, making them particularly vulnerable to infections. Older kids and adults can spread viruses to babies, even if they don't feel very sick. Because of this, anyone who is around babies should be up to date on all recommended vaccines. This includes parents, siblings, and any other caregivers, like grandparents, or babysitters. Anyone who needs vaccines should get them at least two weeks before meeting the baby because it takes about two weeks to develop antibodies after vaccination.
Anyone who is around babies should be up to date on all recommended vaccines.
9. If you get pregnant again, you'll need a Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy.
The amount of antibodies you have in your body after getting vaccinated decreases over time. When you get a vaccine during one pregnancy, your antibody levels may not stay high enough to provide enough protection during future pregnancies, even if your babies are close in age. So, make sure you give baby number 2 (and 3 and 4…) the greatest amount of protective antibodies and the best disease protection possible by getting your Tdap vaccine each time you are pregnant. You should also get a flu shot every flu season, and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.
You'll need a Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy.

Immunization Information Systems Resources
ABOUT
Immunization information systems (IIS) are confidential, population-based, computerized databases that record all immunization doses administered by participating providers to persons residing within a given geopolitical area.
What is IIS ?
At the point of clinical care, an IIS can provide consolidated immunization histories for use by a vaccination provider in determining appropriate client vaccinations.
At the population level, an IIS provides aggregate data on vaccinations for use in surveillance and program operations, and in guiding public health action with the goals of improving vaccination rates and reducing vaccine-preventable disease.
Program Support
IIS help immunization programs identify populations at high risk for vaccine-preventable diseases and target interventions and resources efficiently.
Privacy and Confidentiality
IIS must protect the privacy of all users, including children, families, and providers. According to standards set by CDC, all IIS must have a written privacy policy that clearly defines the following:
Notification – parents must be notified of the existence of the IIS, what information will be contained in it, and how the information will be used.
Choice – Parents must be allowed to choose whether to participate in the IIS.
Use of IIS information – IIS information must only be used for its intended purpose and not be used in a punitive manner.
Access to and Disclosure of IIS information – Policies must clearly define who has access to IIS information, what constitutes a breach of confidentiality, and what the associated penalties are.
Data Retention – the period of time that IIS information will be kept.
Consolidated Records
IIS combine immunization information from different sources into a single record and provide official immunization records for school, day care, and camp entry requirements.
Timely Immunization
IIS remind families when an immunization is due or has been missed.
Clinical Decision Support
IIS help providers and parents determine when immunizations are due and help ensure that children get only the vaccinations they need.
Data Exchange
IIS are capable of exchanging immunization information with immunization healthcare providers. Data exchange between IIS and other information systems helps ensure timely immunizations, consolidation of records, and allows immunization providers to work more efficiently.

Impaired Driving
Impaired Driving
KEY POINTS
Impaired driving happens when someone operates a vehicle while impaired by substances such as marijuana, illicit drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and/or alcohol.
Driving while impaired by any substance is dangerous and illegal.
There are effective measures that can help prevent injuries and deaths from impaired driving.
Effects of substances on driving
Safe driving requires focus, coordination, good judgment, and quick reactions to the environment. Any alcohol or other drug
use impairs the ability to drive safely.
The amount of alcohol in a person's system can be measured. This measurement is called blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Most states have set the legal BAC limit for driving at 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter (g/dL); the limit is 0.05 g/dL in Utah.1 However, impairment starts at lower BAC levels. Information on the effects of alcohol on driving at a range of BACs is available here
.
We know a lot about alcohol's effects on driving, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact of drugs on driving skills.2 However, research has shown that both legal and illicit drugs impair the skills needed to drive safely. For example:
Some of the effects of being impaired by marijuana that can affect driving include slowed reaction time and decision making, impaired coordination, and distorted perception.2345
Other drugs (such as cocaine or illicit amphetamines) can also impair skills like perception, memory, and attention in the short or long term.2
Prescription and over-the-counter medications can cause many side effects that can impact driving, such as sleepiness, impaired vision, and impaired coordination.6
Use of multiple substances (such as marijuana and alcohol) at the same time can increase impairment.57
Impacts
In 2020, 11,654 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol-impaired drivers, accounting for 30% of all traffic-related deaths in the United States.8
32 people in the United States are killed every day in crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver — this is one death every 45 minutes.8
It is not known how many people are killed each year in crashes involving drug-impaired drivers because of data limitations.9 Regardless, driving while impaired by any substance is dangerous and illegal.
Keep Reading: Impaired Driving Facts
People at increased risk
Some groups are more at risk for impaired driving and related crashes and deaths. These include teen drivers and passengers,10 young adult drivers, men, and drivers who don't always wear a seat belt.8
Keep Reading: People at Increased Risk for Impaired Driving
What the research shows
There are multiple effective measures that states and communities can take to prevent alcohol-impaired driving. These include actively implementing and enforcing lower BAC limits11 and implementing sobriety checkpoints.12
Keep Reading: Preventing Impaired Driving
What you can do
For drivers: Plan ahead. If you plan to drink alcohol or use drugs, make plans so that you do not have to drive.
For everyone: Don't let your friends drive while impaired by alcohol and/or drugs. If you're hosting a party where alcohol or drugs will be available, remind your guests to plan ahead.

Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)
CDC's website is being modified to comply with President Trump's Executive Orders.
About ART
AT A GLANCE
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes all fertility treatments or procedures in which either eggs or embryos are handled to help achieve a pregnancy.
See more information on the definition of ART below.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to a female patient or a gestational carrier. ART also includes egg and embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and egg and embryo donation. The most common type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF). Other types of ART, such as gamete intrafallopian transfer or zygote intrafallopian transfer, are rarely performed.
ART does NOT include treatments in which only sperm are handled (such as intrauterine insemination). It also does NOT include procedures in which a woman takes drugs only to stimulate egg production without planning to have the eggs surgically retrieved.

Occupation and Industry Data Collection and Use
About Occupation and Industry Data
AT A GLANCE
Public health researchers use occupation and industry information to assess whether workplace hazards, injuries, and illnesses are higher among people working in certain jobs and industries.
It is important for everyone to collect the right information, prepare the data for analysis, and follow tips to ensure a robust analysis.
Why it is important
What do these three people have in common?
A 28-year-old woman has chronic back pain.
A 52-year-old man has a cough that won't go away.
A 17-year-old boy develops a rash on his arms.
What if you knew:
The woman is a mail carrier for the post office.
The man volunteers in the elephant house at a local zoo.
The boy works part-time as a presser for a dry cleaner.
Each of these people have symptoms that could be caused by a variety of things. However, work (including volunteer work) is often overlooked as a possible source of health problems.
Information about a person's work can help determine if hazards, injuries, or illnesses are higher among certain occupations and industries. But, before you collect and analyze this information, there are some things to consider to ensure you get the information you need.
How to get started
There are three main steps to using occupation and industry data:
Collect the right data

Epstein-Barr Virus and Infectious Mononucleosis
About Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
KEY POINTS
EBV is one of the most common human viruses in the world and spreads through bodily fluids, primarily saliva.
EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses.
There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection.
What it is
Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, is one of the most common human viruses in the world. EBV is also known as human herpesvirus 4 and is a member of the herpes virus family.
Most people will get infected with EBV in their lifetime, especially in childhood, and will not have symptoms. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses.
About mononucleosis
EBV is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, also called ""mono."" This contagious disease is common among teens and adults.
Learn more
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of EBV infection can include:
Fatigue
Fever
Inflamed throat
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
Enlarged spleen
Swollen liver
Rash
People who get symptoms from EBV infection, usually teenagers or adults, get better in 2 to 4 weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several weeks or even months.
Who is at risk
After you get an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent (inactive) in your body. In some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates.
How it spreads
You can spread the virus for weeks!
When you first get EBV, you can spread it for weeks and even before you have symptoms. Once EBV is in your body, it stays inactive. If it reactivates, you can potentially infect others no matter how much time has passed since the first infection.
EBV is most commonly spread through saliva by:
Kissing
Sharing drinks and food
Sharing drinking cups, eating utensils, or toothbrushes
Having contact with toys that children have drooled on
The virus probably survives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist.
EBV can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations.
Prevention
There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. You can help protect yourself by reducing contact with people who have EBV infection.
Make sure you avoid:
Kissing
Sharing drinks and food
Using the same personal items that an infected person recently used
Testing and diagnosis
Diagnosing EBV infection can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to other illnesses. EBV infection can be confirmed with a blood test that detects antibodies. About 9 out of 10 adults have antibodies that show that they have a current or past EBV infection.
Keep Reading:
Laboratory Testing for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
Treatment and recovery
Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. There is no specific treatment for EBV. However, some things can be done to help relieve symptoms such as:
Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
Getting plenty of rest
Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever

Infertility: Frequently Asked Questions
WHAT TO KNOW
This page has definitions and frequently asked questions related to infertility. It has important information about infertility, including common misconceptions, risk factors, and treatment options.
What is infertility?
For couples hoping to become parents, difficulty conceiving a baby can be frustrating and unexpected. Many couples who struggle with infertility do end up having children, sometimes with medical help. An important early step is understanding possible causes of infertility.
For public health data collection, infertility is defined as not being able to get pregnant (conceive) after 1 year (or longer) of unprotected sex.
Fertility in women is known to decline steadily with age. As a result, some providers evaluate and treat women aged 35 years or older after 6 months of unprotected sex.
These definitions of infertility are not intended to guide recommendations about the provision of fertility care services to individuals or families.
For couples hoping to become parents, difficulty conceiving a baby can be frustrating and unexpected.
Both men and women can contribute to infertility.
Individuals and couples who are unable to conceive a child should consider making an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist. This is a health care provider who specializes in managing infertility.
Pregnancy is the result of a process that has many steps. To get pregnant:
A woman's body must release an egg from one of her ovaries
.
A man's sperm must join with the egg along the way (fertilize).
The fertilized egg must go through a fallopian tube
toward the uterus
.
The embryo must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation).
Infertility may result from a problem with any or several of these steps.
Impaired fecundity is a condition related to infertility. It refers to women who have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.
Reproductive endocrinologists may also be able to help women with recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as having two or more spontaneous miscarriages.
Is infertility a common problem?
Yes. In the United States, 1 in 5 (19%) of married women aged 15 to 49 with no prior births are unable to get pregnant after 1 year of trying. About 1 in 4 (26%) of women in this group have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.
What causes infertility in women?
Women need functioning ovaries
, fallopian tubes
, and a uterus
to get pregnant. Conditions affecting any one of these organs can contribute to female infertility.
Disruption of ovarian function
A woman's menstrual cycle
is on average 28 days long. Regular, predictable periods that occur every 21 to 35 days likely reflect ovulation
. A woman with irregular periods is likely not ovulating. Ovulation can be predicted by using an ovulation test or blood test.
Disruption in ovarian function may be caused by several conditions and calls for an evaluation by a health care provider. No single test is a perfect predictor of fertility, but there are tests for common markers of ovarian function. These include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), and antral follicle count (AFC) tests.
Some conditions that may cause issues related to ovarian function include the following:
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility. PCOS is a condition that causes women to not ovulate, or to ovulate irregularly.
Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is a condition where there are fewer eggs remaining in the ovaries than expected at a specific age. This condition can be due to congenital, medical, surgical, or unexplained causes.
Impaired function of the hypothalamus and pituitary glands can affect ovarian function. If impaired, these glands can cause too much of the hormones that maintain normal ovarian function to be produced.
Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is a condition that can affect ovarian function. It can be caused by excessive exercise, weight loss, or stress, or by a combination of these factors.
Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
is sometimes referred to as premature menopause. It occurs when a woman's ovaries fail before age 40.
Fallopian tube obstruction
Fallopian tubes
can be evaluated by various methods, including with a hysterosalpingogram or by chromopertubation.
Hysterosalpingogram is an X-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes. These images are used to see if dye moves freely through the fallopian tubes indicating they are open.
Chromopertubation is similar to a hysterosalpingogram but is done in the operating room at the time of a laparoscopy. This test is used to evaluate if the fallopian tubes are open and to assess if they are dilated.
Risk factors for fallopian tube obstruction include:
History of pelvic infection
Ruptured appendix
Gonorrhea
Chlamydia
Endometriosis
Prior abdominal surgery
Abnormalities of the uterus
The uterus
may be evaluated by transvaginal ultrasound to look for various problems. A sonohystogram or hysteroscopy may also be performed to evaluate the uterine environment.
Problems that affect the physical characteristics of the uterus include:
Intrauterine adhesions
Endometrial polyps
Adenomyosis
Congenital anomalies of the uterus
Fibroids
What increases a woman's risk of infertility?
Female fertility is known to decline with:
Age. Fertility declines with age primarily because egg quality declines over time. Older women also have fewer eggs left, and they are more likely to have health conditions that can cause fertility problems. Aging also increases a woman's chances of miscarriage
and of having a child with a genetic abnormality.
Smoking.
Excessive alcohol use.
Having overweight, obesity, or low body weight.
Extreme weight gain or loss.
Excessive physical or emotional stress that results in amenorrhea (absent periods).
What causes infertility in men?
Infertility in men can be caused by disruption of testicular or ejaculatory function, as well as by hormonal and genetic disorders. It is typically evaluated by a semen analysis, complete medical history, and physical examination. This assessment helps determine if and how male factors are contributing to infertility.
A semen analysis assesses the number (concentration), motility (movement), and morphology (shape) of sperm. The results are then evaluated by a specialist. If semen is found to be slightly abnormal, it does not necessarily mean that a man is infertile.
Disruption of testicular or ejaculatory function
Some conditions that can disrupt testicular or ejaculatory function include the following:
Varicocele is a condition in which the veins in the testicles are enlarged, which may affect the number or shape of the sperm.
Trauma to the testes may affect sperm production and result in lower number of sperm.
Unhealthy habits, such as heavy alcohol use, smoking, anabolic steroid use, and illicit drug use, may decrease sperm production.
Cancer treatment involving the use of certain types of chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery to remove one or both testicles may affect sperm production or the ability of sperm to fertilize an egg.
Medical conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, certain types of autoimmune disorders, and certain types of infections may cause testicular failure.
Hormonal disorders
Improper function of the hypothalamus or pituitary glands are hormonal disorders that can cause infertility. These glands produce hormones that maintain normal testicular function. Too much of these hormones, especially prolactin, can result in infertility. Other conditions that damage or impair the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland may also result in low or no sperm production.
Examples of hormonal disorders include:
Malignant (cancerous) pituitary tumors
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Exposure to too much estrogen
Exposure to too much testosterone
Cushing's syndrome
Chronic use of medications called glucocorticoids
Genetic disorders
Genetic conditions can cause no sperm or low numbers of sperm to be produced.
Examples of genetic disorders include:
Klinefelter's syndrome
Y-chromosome microdeletion
Myotonic dystrophy
What increases a man's risk of infertility?
Male fertility is known to decline with:
Age. Couples in which the male partner is 40 or older are more likely to report difficulty conceiving.
Having overweight or obesity.
Smoking.
Excessive use of alcohol or drug use (such as opioids or marijuana).
A history of trauma to the testes.
Exposure to testosterone, radiation, certain medicines, or certain environmental toxins.
Frequent exposure of the testes to high temperatures.
When should couples trying to get pregnant see a health care provider?
A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.
Couples with no apparent health or fertility problems, in which the woman is under 35 years old and has regular menstrual cycles, should try to conceive for at least one year before seeing a health care provider.
Couples with no apparent health or fertility problems, in which the woman is 35 years or older and has regular menstrual cycles, should see a health care provider after 6 months of trying to conceive naturally without success.
Couples in which the woman is older than 40 should consider seeking more immediate evaluation and treatment.
Couples with the following signs or symptoms should not delay seeing their health care provider when they are trying to become pregnant:
For women:
Irregular periods or no menstrual periods.
A history of endometriosis
or very painful menstrual periods.
A history of pelvic inflammatory disease.
Known or suspected uterine or tubal disease.
A history of more than one miscarriage.
Genetic or acquired conditions that can diminish ovarian reserve.
For men:
A history of testicular trauma.
Prior hernia surgery.
Prior use of chemotherapy.
A history of infertility with another partner.
Sexual dysfunction.
Health care providers will collect a thorough medical and sexual history from both partners. Initial evaluation can include tests that are appropriate based on the couple’s specific circumstances. These tests may include: a semen analysis, tubal evaluation, and ovarian reserve testing.
It is a good idea for couples to talk to a health care provider before trying to get pregnant. Providers can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving. Learn more about about planning for pregnancy.
How do health care providers treat infertility?
There are a variety of treatment options for infertility. The type of treatment offered depends on the cause of infertility, its duration, and your age. Your health care provider may need to perform preliminary testing to determine the best treatment option for you. A couple's treatment preferences after they have received counseling about success rates, risk factors, and benefits of each option also determine how their infertility is treated.
Treatment options for infertility may include timed intercourse, medications, intrauterine insemination, surgery, or assisted reproductive technology.
Timed intercourse
Timed intercourse—with or without—medication is often the first option for many couples who are trying to conceive. It may be recommended for couples where the male has normal or close to normal sperm count and motility (movement), the female has open (or functioning) fallopian tubes, and the couple is physically able to have intercourse.
With timed intercourse, a couple tracks the woman's ovulation and has intercourse around the time of ovulation. If a woman ovulates normally on her own, she may not need to take medication. Otherwise, she may need to take medication (orally or through injection) to stimulate ovulation.
Medications
There are a variety of medications used to treat infertility in women. Many fertility medications increase a woman's chance of having twins, triplets, or other multiples. Women who are pregnant with multiples may have more problems during pregnancy and are at higher risk of being born prematurely (too early). Premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems. Your health care provider may talk with you about strategies to reduce the risk of multiple births while using infertility medications.
Intrauterine insemination
Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an infertility treatment that is sometimes referred to as ""artificial insemination."" During this procedure, specially prepared sperm are inserted into the woman's uterus. This treatment may be recommended for couples in which the male has close to normal sperm count and motility (movement) and the ability to produce a semen sample in the office (or, under some circumstances, at home) and the woman has open, functioning fallopian tubes.
This treatment may be appropriate for couples:
Where the woman does not ovulate normally on her own but can be made to ovulate with medication.
Who experience unexplained infertility.
With mild male factor infertility (slightly low sperm count or sperm motility).
And same-sex female couples wishing to conceive with donor sperm.
Surgery
Surgical treatments for fertility are rare because of the success of other treatments, such as Intrauterine insemination (IUI) and In vitro fertilization (IVF). Surgery may be recommended to women with certain diagnoses to increase the likelihood of conceiving. Examples include removing fibroids surgically from the uterus with a procedure called a myomectomy or surgery to treat blocked fallopian tubes. Men may also be offered surgery for specific diagnoses, such as varicoceles.
In vitro fertilization
Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes all fertility treatments in which either eggs or embryos are handled outside of the body. The main type of ART is in vitro fertilization (IVF). In general, ART procedures involve removing eggs from a woman's ovaries using a needle. These eggs are then combined with sperm in the laboratory to create embryos. The embryos are returned to the woman's body, frozen for future use, or donated to another woman.
A variation of ART, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), is often used for couples with male factor infertility. With ICSI, a single sperm is injected into a mature egg.
Preimplantation genetic testing can be used during ART to identify genetic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities in embryos. One or more cells are biopsied from each embryo and sent for testing.
ART can be expensive and time-consuming. Despite these challenges, ART has helped many couples have children that otherwise would not have been conceived.
Success rates after IVF vary and depend on many factors. They can include the clinic performing the procedure, the infertility diagnosis, and the age of the woman undergoing the procedure. The woman's age is especially important.
CDC publishes ART success rates for all fertility clinics in the United States. In addition, CDC created an IVF Success Estimator to help estimate the chance of having a live birth using IVF based on the experiences of women and couples with similar characteristics.
The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. This can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are transferred back to the uterus. For example, transfer of a single embryo greatly reduces the chances of a multiple pregnancy. Using a single embryo, rather than multiple embryos, lowers risks such as preterm birth.
What is third-party reproduction?
ART procedures sometimes involve the use of donor eggs, donor sperm, or donated embryos. Donor eggs are sometimes used for women who cannot produce eggs. Donor eggs or donor sperm are sometimes used for other reasons, such as a genetic disease that can be passed on to the baby.
An infertile couple may also use donated embryos that were created by other couples in infertility treatment and were not used. When donated embryos are used, the child will not be genetically related to either parent. Donor eggs, donor sperm, or donated embryos may also be used by same-sex couples.
A gestational carrier (surrogate) carries an embryo that was formed from the egg of another woman with the expectation of returning the infant to its intended parents. Women who have no uterus may be able to use a gestational carrier. Women who cannot become pregnant, or who have a serious health problem and should not become pregnant may also consider this option.

About Swine/Variant Flu
WHAT TO KNOW
Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs.
Influenza viruses that commonly circulate in swine are called “swine influenza viruses” or “swine flu viruses.”
Like human influenza viruses, there are different subtypes and strains of swine influenza viruses.
The main swine influenza viruses circulating in U.S. pigs in recent years have been, swine triple reassortant (tr) H1N1 influenza virus, trH3N2 virus, and trH1N2 virus.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called ""variant viruses."" They also can be denoted by adding the letter ""v"" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States.

Who Needs a Flu Vaccine
WHAT TO KNOW
Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza.
Flu Vaccine
A number of flu vaccines will be available this season. These include:
injectable flu vaccines, or flu shots. These include:
Flu shots that are made with inactivated influenza viruses.
One flu shot that is made without influenza viruses.
A live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is given by nasal spray.
People who can get the flu shot
Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza.
Flu vaccination has important benefits. It can reduce flu illnesses, visits to doctor's offices, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as make symptoms less severe and reduce flu-related hospitalizations and deaths in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.
Get vaccinated before flu season starts
It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body.
Recommended vaccines depend on a person's age and other characteristics
There are standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines that are approved for people as young as 6 months of age.
Some vaccines are only approved for adults. For example, the recombinant flu vaccine is approved for people 18 years and older, and the adjuvanted and high-dose inactivated vaccines are approved for people 65 years and older.
For people younger than 65 years, CDC does not recommend any one flu vaccine over another.
For adults 65 years and older, there are 3 flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended. These are Fluzone High-Dose inactivated flu vaccine, Flublok recombinant flu vaccine, and Fluad adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine. If none of the 3 flu vaccines preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older is available at the time of administration, people in this age group can get any other age-appropriate flu vaccine instead.
For many people who are 2 years through 49 years of age, the nasal spray flu vaccine is an option. The nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for people with some medical conditions. Also, if you are pregnant, you should not get the nasal spray flu vaccine.
In general, each person should get an age-appropriate flu vaccine (that is, one that is approved for their age). However, solid organ transplant recipients who are 18 through 64 years of age and who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive high-dose inactivated flu vaccine or adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine (which are currently approved for people ages 65 years and older). These vaccines are not preferred over other age-appropriate flu vaccines but are acceptable options for this population.
High-dose inactivated flu vaccine, recombinant flu vaccine, and adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine are preferred for people 65 years of age and older. There are no other preferential recommendations for specific flu vaccines for specific groups of people.

Vaccines and People with Egg Allergies
There are many vaccine options
If you are pregnant or have certain chronic health conditions, you should get a flu shot.
People with egg allergy may get any vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg.
The most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year.
When to get vaccinated against flu
For most people who need only one dose of influenza vaccine for the season, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Additional considerations concerning the timing of vaccination for certain groups of people include:
Most adults, especially those 65 years and older, and pregnant women in the first or second trimester should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time. However, early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated.
Some children need two doses of influenza vaccine. For those children, it is recommended that the first dose be given as soon as vaccine is available because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for children who need only one dose.
Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for mothers who are in the third trimester of pregnancy, because this can help protect their infants for the first few months after birth (when they are too young to be vaccinated).
<!-- Flu Finder Widget !-->
People who SHOULD NOT get a flu shot
Children younger than 6 months of age are too young to get a flu shot.
People with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine (other than egg proteins) should not get that vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.
People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine in the past, it is important to talk with your health care provider to help determine whether vaccination is appropriate for you.
People who should talk to their health care provider before getting a flu shot
Different influenza vaccines are approved for use in people in different age groups. In addition, some vaccines are not recommended for certain groups of people. Factors that can determine a person’s suitability for vaccination, or vaccination with a particular vaccine, include a person’s age, health (current and past) and any allergies to influenza vaccine or its components.
Children younger than 6 months of age are too young to get a flu shot.
People with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine (other than egg proteins) should not get that vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.
People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine in the past, it is important to talk with your health care provider to help determine whether vaccination is appropriate for you.
Prioritized for flu vaccination during a vaccine shortage
When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to the following people (no hierarchy is implied by order of listing):
Children aged 6 months through 4 years (59 months);
People aged 50 years and olderA;
People with chronic pulmonary (including asthma) or cardiovascular (except isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus);
People who are immunosuppressed due to any cause, including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection;
Mothers who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season and up to 2 weeks postpartum (after delivery);
People who are aged 6 months through 18 years who are receiving aspirin or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;
People who are residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities;
American Indian or Alaska Native persons;
People with extreme obesity (body-mass index [BMI] is 40 or greater);
Health care personnel;
Household contacts and caregivers of children under 5 years and adults 50 years and older; and
Household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at increased risk for severe illness from influenza.

Influenza (Flu)
Cold Versus Flu
PURPOSE
Influenza (flu) and the common cold are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses.
Colds and flu share many symptoms, so it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.
Cold symptoms are usually milder than flu.
Special tests can tell if a person is sick with flu.
Understanding the Differences Between a Cold and the Flu:
Influenza (flu) and the common cold are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. Flu is caused by influenza viruses only, whereas the common cold can be caused by a number of different viruses, including rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, and seasonal coronaviruses. Seasonal coronaviruses should not be confused with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Because flu and the common cold have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. In general, flu is worse than the common cold, and symptoms are typically more intense and begin more abruptly. Colds are usually milder than flu. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose than people who have flu. Colds generally do not result in serious health problems, such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations. Flu can have serious associated complications.
Key Differences Between a Cold and the Flu:
Because colds and flu share many symptoms, it can be difficult (or even impossible) to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Special tests can tell if a person is sick with flu.
Flu Symptoms vs. Cold Symptoms:
The signs and symptoms of flu can include fever or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue (tiredness). Cold symptoms are usually milder than the symptoms of flu. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. Colds generally do not result in serious health problems.

Information Quality Support
WHAT TO KNOW
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines to ensure the highest quality scientific information.
Anyone can submit requests to correct information if it does not follow CDC guidelines.
Purpose
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is committed to applying rigorous scientific standards to ensure the accuracy and reliability of research results. The scientific community recognizes peer review as the primary method of quality control for scientific and technical documents.
CDC receives input from highly qualified peer reviewers on a routine basis. Peer reviewers look for propriety, accuracy, completeness, and quality (including objectivity, utility, and integrity) of CDC materials. Peer review may be different throughout the scientific process. However, the overall goal is to get an objective evaluation of scientific information from fellow scientists.
Peer review standards
The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) encourages Federal agencies to use peer review, especially when sharing official government scientific information. To support this, OMB developed Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review
. This document includes guidelines to create standards for peer review. The Bulletin is part of a broader effort under the 2001 Information Quality Act (Public Law No. 106-554, Section 515[a]
). This ensures the quality of all information that federal agencies share with the public.

Peer Review Agenda
What's included
CDC has developed information quality guidelines to continue providing the public with high-quality information. The guidelines also include ways for people to submit requests to CDC for corrections, if they suspect the information does not follow them.
CDC cannot always predict how shared information will influence and affect others. However, the agency expects all CDC scientific reports to have clear and specific information stating how the results are generated, including
The data that are used.
Various assumptions.
Analytic methods.
Statistical procedures.
Sources of error.
This ensures that the original analysis of shared scientific information is a fully transparent process.
What it applies to
The guidelines apply to information in all forms-print, electronic, audiovisual, verbal, etc. The guidelines focus primarily on the dissemination of substantive information (e.g., reports, studies, summaries) rather than information belonging to basic agency operations. Information that is shared at the request of CDC or with specific CDC approval through a contract or a grant is subject to these guidelines.
Information that is subject to the guidelines includes:
Scientific research papers, books, journal articles, and similar authoritative materials unless they have disclaimers alerting the audience that they do not represent official views of CDC.
Official reports, brochures, documents, newsletters, electronic documents, and audiovisual productions.
Editorials, commentaries, and letters to the editor, but only if they are provided by CDC staff representing official CDC viewpoints.
Verbal information, including speeches, interviews, and expert opinions, but only if it represents CDC viewpoints, official positions, or policies.
Statistical information, including statistical analyses and aggregated information by program, institute, or center or for CDC, including funding information and histories (by disease, funding mechanism, dollars, and other criteria).
Consensus panel reports and open meetings' proceedings and minutes.
What it doesn’t apply to
Although information that is not covered by the OMB guidelines is not subject to the new administrative correction procedures, the information is still subject to the usual CDC internal review procedures for accuracy and high quality. This information includes:
National Library of Medicine (NLM) databases or other archival records, CRISP, and similar databases.
Documents not authored by the agency and not representing the agency's views, including information authored and distributed by CDC grantees.
Information that is limited in dissemination to Government employees or agency contractors or grantees.
Information pertaining to basic agency operations, including information about agency authorities, activities, and programs; contact information for the public; organizational charts; CDC or institute or center directors' status reports; solicitations [program announcements (PAs)/requests for applications (RFAs)]; and receipt and review materials (e.g., summary statements, information for advisory councils or advisory committee members).
Information intended solely for intra- or interagency use.
Responses to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or other similar laws
Information relating solely to correspondence with individuals.
Press releases that support the announcement or give public notice of information that CDC has disseminated elsewhere.
Information for public filings, subpoenas, or adjudicative processes.
Opinions where the agency's presentation makes it clear that what is being offered is personal opinion rather than fact or the agency's viewpoints.

CDC Information Quality Guidelines
OMB Information Quality Guidelines—February 22, 2002
Requests for Corrections and HHS Responses
Corrections
CDC has developed administrative mechanisms to allow affected persons to seek and obtain correction of disseminated information that does not comply with OMB, HHS and CDC guidelines.
How to request
The complaint must contain:
Detailed description of the specific information that needs to be corrected including where the information is located, i.e. the publication title, date, and publication number, if any, or the Website and Web page address (url), or the speech title, presenter, date and place of delivery;
Specific reasons for believing the information does not comply with OMB, HHS or CDC guidelines and is in error and supporting documentation, if any;
Specific recommendations for correcting the information
Description of how the person submitting the complaint is affected by the information error; and
Name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and organizational affiliation, if any, of the individual making the complaint.
Complainants should be aware that they bear the ""burden of proof"" with respect to the necessity for correction as well as with respect to the type of correction they seek.
Where to send
Complaints or requests for review and correction of information must be in electronic form and sent to InfoQuality@cdc.gov.
What happens next
CDC will respond to all requests for correction within 60 calendar days of receipt. If more than 60 days are needed, CDC will inform the requestor that more time is required and will state the reason why and an estimated decision date.
Based on a review of the information provided, CDC staff will determine whether a correction is warranted, and if so, what action to take. Any corrective action will be determined by the nature and timeliness of the information involved, the significance of the correction on the use of the information, and the magnitude of the correction. CDC will respond to the requestor by email. The response will explain the findings of the review and the actions CDC will take. CDC may reject claims made in bad faith or without justification.
Requests for correction of information are handled primarily by the director or designee (e.g., scientific director, laboratory or branch chief) of the institute or center where the information originated. If more than one institute or center was involved in releasing the information, the institute or center of the lead CDC author should take primary responsibility for coordinating a response.
Appeal requests
If CDC denies your request for correction, you can send a written request for reconsideration within 30 days of receiving the agency's decision. You can send the request as a hard copy or electronically.
How to appeal
State the reasons for the appeal.
Reference the CDC tracking number provided in the CDC response to the original request.
Clearly mark the appeal with “Information Quality Appeal”. (Hard copy)
Clearly mark the outside envelope with ""Information Quality Appeal"". (Hard copy)
Where to send
To submit the appeal electronically, send an email to InfoQuality@cdc.gov.
Contact information
For any other questions on CDC Information Quality, send an email to InfoQuality@cdc.gov.

Injection Safety
Safe Injection Practices and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Most healthcare providers follow safe injection practices. Though uncommon, unsafe medical injections sometimes occur.
Understanding safe injection practices can protect you from harm.
The reuse of needles or syringes and the misuse of medication vials are unsafe injection practices.
Overview
Safe injection practices are actions healthcare providers should follow when performing medical injections. A safe injection does not harm the recipient or expose the healthcare provider to avoidable risks.
Healthcare providers should never reuse a needle or syringe on more than one patient. Providers must discard both needles and syringes once used. Reusing the needle and/or syringe is unsafe and can spread disease.
For example, unsafe injection practices can occur during:
Administration of anesthetics (drugs to decrease the feeling of pain or eliminate it by putting you to sleep) for outpatient surgical, diagnostic and pain management procedures.
Administration of intravenous (IV) medications for chemotherapy, cosmetic procedures and alternative medicine therapies.
Use of saline to flush IV lines and catheters.
Administration of vaccines.
Why it is important
Unsafe injection practices can be a serious threat to your health.
Unsafe injections can spread diseases like hepatitis C, hepatitis B, bacterial and fungal diseases, and possibly HIV if injection equipment, like needles or syringes, is reused on more than one patient or to access vials that are shared between patients.
Most healthcare providers follow safe injection practices. Though not common, unsafe injection practices sometimes occur. When unsafe injection practices occur, providers should notify possibly affected patients and inform them to get tested.
To learn more about safe injection practices, talk to your healthcare provider.
Terms to know
A syringe is an instrument used to inject fluids into the body or draw them from the body. Healthcare providers should only use a syringe once, then discard it.
A needle is a sharp pointed object used for injection or removal of fluid from the body. Healthcare providers should only use a needle once, then discard it.
A single-dose vial is a bottle of liquid medication healthcare providers give to a patient using a needle and syringe. A single-dose vial is approved for use on a single patient for a single procedure or injection.
A multi-dose vial is a bottle of liquid medication that contains more than one dose of medication and is recognized by its FDA-approved label. Healthcare providers use multi-dose vials to deliver a variety of medications and vaccines. If handled safely, they can be accessed for more than one patient. Healthcare providers should always use a new needle and syringe when accessing the contents of a multi-dose vial. Reuse of needles or syringes can contaminate medicine with germs, which can spread to others.

Outdoor Workers
Insects and Scorpions at Work
KEY POINTS
Stinging or biting insects or scorpions can be hazardous to outdoor workers.
Stinging or biting insects include bees, wasps, hornets, and fire ants.
Employers and workers can take steps to prevent bites and stings.
Overview
A sting or bite from insects or scorpions can cause mild discomfort or pain. Workers allergic to the insect’s venom could die from anaphylactic shock. Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic reaction and requires immediate emergency care.
Prevention
It is important for employers to train their workers about:
Their risk of exposure to insects and scorpions.
How they can prevent and protect themselves from stings and bites.
What they should do if they are stung or bitten.
Allergic Reactions
Workers with a history of severe allergic reactions to insect bites or stings should carry an EpiPen and wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace.
Bees, wasps, and hornets
Bees, wasps, and hornets are most abundant in the warmer months. Nests and hives may be found in trees, under roof eaves, or on equipment such as ladders.
Bees, wasps, and hornets are found throughout the United States.
Worker protections
Wear light-colored, smooth-finished clothing.
Avoid perfumed soaps, shampoos, and deodorants.
Don't wear cologne or perfume.
Avoid bananas and banana-scented toiletries.
Wear clean clothing and bathe daily. Sweat may anger bees.
Wear clothing to cover as much of the body as possible.
Avoid flowering plants when possible.
Keep work areas clean. Social wasps thrive in places where humans discard food.
Remain calm and still if a single stinging insect is flying around. Swatting at an insect may cause it to sting.
If you are attacked by several stinging insects at once, run to get away from them. Bees release a chemical when they sting, which may attract other bees.
Go indoors.
A shaded area is better than an open area to get away from insects.
Do not jump into water since some insects will hover above water.
If a bee comes inside your vehicle, stop the car slowly, and open all the windows.
First aid
If a worker is stung by a bee, wasp, or hornet:
Have someone stay with them to see if they have an allergic reaction.
Wash the site with soap and water.
Remove the stinger.
Wipe gauze or scrape a fingernail over the area.
Never squeeze the stinger or use tweezers.
Apply ice to reduce swelling.
Do not scratch the sting.
Scratching may increase swelling, itching, and risk of infection.
Fire ants
Fire ants bite and sting. They are aggressive when stinging and inject venom, which causes a burning sensation. Red bumps form at the sting, and within a day or two they become white fluid-filled pustules.
Fire ants are mostly found in the Southeastern United States, with limited geographic distribution in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
Worker protections
Do not disturb or stand on or near ant mounds.
Be careful when lifting items (including animal carcasses) off the ground, as they may be covered in ants.
Fire ants may also be found on trees or in water, so always look over the area before starting to work.
First aid
If a worker is stung or bitten by fire ants:
Rub off ants briskly, as they will attach to the skin with their jaws.
Antihistamines may help.
Follow directions on the package.
Drowsiness may occur.
Take them to an emergency medical facility immediately if they have:
Severe chest pain
Nausea
Severe sweating
Loss of breath
Serious swelling
Slurred speech
Scorpions
Scorpions usually hide during the day and are active at night. They may be hiding under rocks, wood, or anything else lying on the ground. Some species may also burrow into the ground. Most scorpions live in dry, desert areas. However, some species can be found in grasslands, forests, and inside caves.
Scorpions are found in the Southern and Southwestern United States.
Symptoms
Symptoms of a scorpion sting may include:
Stinging or burning at the sting site (very little swelling or inflammation)
Positive ""tap test"" (extreme pain when the sting site is tapped with a finger)
Restlessness
Convulsions
Roving eyes
Staggering gait
Thick tongue sensation and/or slurred speech
Drooling
Muscle twitches
Abdominal pain and cramps
Trouble breathing
These symptoms usually subside within 48 hours, although stings from a bark scorpion can be life-threatening.
Worker protections
Wear long sleeves and pants.
Wear leather gloves.
Shake out clothing or shoes before putting them on.
First aid
If a worker is stung by a scorpion:
Contact a qualified health care provider or poison control center.
Apply ice, but do not submerge the affected area in ice water.
Remain relaxed and calm.
Do not take any sedatives.
Capture the scorpion for identification if it is safe to do so.

Centers for Disease Control & Prevention—NIOSH IRB
Based in Cincinnati Ohio, this IRB reviews human research conducted or supported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. This board meets on the second Tuesday of each month and as needed for emergency situations.
Service on an IRB
IRB members serve for three years. They may serve longer at the discretion of the CDC Human Research Protection Office, the IRB chair, and the member. Service on an IRB is considered vital to the continuing research efforts of the agency and volunteers are always welcome.
The IRB chairs and vice-chairs collectively form the IRB Executive Committee. This committee meets as needed to discuss matters of common interest to the IRBs, to refine policy and practice, and to strive for reasonable consistency across the IRBs.
Training requirements for conducting research on human subjects at CDC
CDC investigators and scientific administrative staff involved in the conduct or oversight of federally funded human research are required to maintain competency in research ethics and human research regulations. This is done by completing specific trainings via the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)
prior to initiating activities. It is also required at certain intervals afterwards.
For partners working under an existing Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), CDC will continue to verify the active FWA.
Individual investigators not working under separate FWA (i.e., collaborating with CDC under an Individual Investigator Agreement) will be asked to submit proof of having completed human subject research training within the past 3 years.

Diabetes
About Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes
KEY POINTS
Insulin resistance leads to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.
Find out more about what it is, what causes it, and how you can reverse it.
What is insulin?
Insulin is a key hormone that regulates your blood sugar levels. It's so important that you can't live without it. Here's how insulin works when everything is working properly:
When you eat, food is broken down into sugars that circulate in your blood.
This increase in blood sugar causes an internal organ called the pancreas to release insulin.
Insulin acts like a key to let blood sugar into your body cells, which use the sugar as energy.
After this happens, your blood sugar returns to a normal level.
Insulin also signals your liver to store extra blood sugar as energy for later. If you haven't eaten recently, your liver releases stored blood sugar so energy is always available.
What is insulin resistance?
Sometimes this finely tuned system can get out of balance. When your body is exposed to too much blood sugar over an extended period of time, you can develop insulin resistance. Here's what that means:
A lot of blood sugar enters your bloodstream.
Your pancreas pumps out high levels of insulin to get more blood sugar into your cells.
Over time, your cells stop responding well to insulin, which is known as resistance.
Your blood sugar remains high, which causes your pancreas to keep releasing more insulin to make your cells respond.
Eventually, your pancreas can't keep up and your blood sugar keeps increasing.
High blood sugar is damaging to the body, so your body keeps trying to remove excess blood sugars. It stores extra sugar in your liver and muscles. When they're full, the liver sends the remaining sugar to be stored as body fat, causing weight gain. Insulin resistance sets the stage for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.
What about type 1 diabetes?
Type 1 diabetes is different from insulin resistance. Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake). While people with insulin resistance don't respond well to insulin, people with type 1 diabetes don't make any or enough insulin to survive.
Do you have insulin resistance?
You can't tell if someone has insulin resistance by looking at them. Although overweight and obesity are risk factors, you do not have to have them to have insulin resistance. Other risk factors for insulin resistance include:
High blood sugar levels.
High triglycerides (a kind of fat found in the blood).
High LDL (bad) cholesterol.
Low HDL (good) cholesterol.
Family history of type 2 diabetes.
Physical inactivity.
Talk to your doctor if you think you might have insulin resistance, or want to find out more.
Reverse insulin resistance
If you have insulin resistance, there's good news. You can reverse it by making your cells more sensitive to insulin.
Physical activity makes you more sensitive to insulin, one reason it's important for diabetes management (and good health in general!). Don't wait until you're diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes to start moving more. The earlier you take action, the better off you'll be.
Weight loss if you have overweight or obesity is another great way to relieve strain on your body and increase your insulin sensitivity.
Eating a balanced diet with non-starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean proteins helps to reduce your blood sugar. This will decrease the amount of insulin your pancreas releases to help reverse insulin resistance.
Other lifestyle changes like managing stress, and getting enough sleep will also help you reach your health goals.
Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration
About IFSAC
AT A GLANCE
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Food Safety and Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture create the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC) in 2011.
IFSAC is working to improve estimates of the sources of foodborne illness.
Purpose
To enhance the safety of our food, three federal agencies—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (FSIS) —teamed up in 2011 to create the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC).
Federal agencies and food safety experts rely on attribution to inform strategic planning and risk-based decision-making, estimate benefits of interventions, and evaluate the impact of interventions. By bringing together data from CDC, FDA and FSIS, and by developing sound analytical methods, IFSAC scientists can improve estimates of the sources of foodborne illness.
IFSAC main objectives:
Address the challenges posed by foodborne illness source attribution.
Work collectively to:
Analyze and interpret human surveillance and food contamination data;
Share data and methods; and
Monitor progress toward the goal of preventing foodborne illness.
Goals
Identify, plan, and conduct selected food safety and foodborne illness analytic projects recognized as high priority by all three agencies.
Foodborne illness source attribution is the current focus of IFSAC's activities.
Improve coordination of federal food safety analytic efforts.
Address cross-cutting priorities for food safety data collection, analysis, and use.

About Micronutrients
KEY POINTS
Vitamins and minerals, called micronutrients, are critical for healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.
Infants, children, adolescent girls, women of reproductive age, and pregnant women are the most likely groups to have deficiencies.
CDC is working in the United States around the world to improve micronutrient intake.
The problem
Micronutrient deficiencies can have significant consequences on our health and well-being, yet:
Approximately 1 in 4 US women have iron deficiency during pregnancy.
Approximately 1 in 8 US women ages 12 to 49 have iron deficiency.
Globally more than half of children younger than 5 suffer from vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
Learn More
You can learn more about the 6 essential micronutrients and their roles in healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.
What CDC is doing
Through the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO), CDC works in the United States and around the world to:
Identify and monitor iodine, iron, and anemia levels among groups at risk for deficiencies.
Provide practical strategies for feeding healthy foods and drinks to infants and toddlers.
Work with partners to engage pediatricians in advising on the importance of good nutrition practices for young children.
Help countries:

Interstitial Cystitis
About Interstitial Cystitis
KEY POINTS
Interstitial cystitis (IC) is also called bladder pain syndrome.
It causes pain in the bladder area, below the belly button.
Anyone at any age can have IC.
It can last for years or be lifelong.
The cause of IC is unknown.
What it is
Almost twice as many women have IC than men.
IC is a chronic bladder condition.
People with IC may feel mild discomfort to severe pain in the pelvis.
Symptoms are similar to urinary tract infections, but there is no infection.
Researchers are not sure what causes IC.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms mostly occur near the bladder.
People with IC can have many different symptoms. They occur below the belly button, near the bladder.
Symptoms can include:
Discomfort, pressure, or tenderness in the pelvis.
Constant or extreme pain in the bladder or pelvis.
Urgent need to pee.
Peeing a lot or more than usual.
Intense pain while peeing or needing to pee.
Who is at risk
IC is common and affects people of all ages, races, and ethnicities.
IC affects about 1% of people in the United States.
Women are more likely to develop IC than men.
Almost twice as many women have IC than men.
Diagnosis
If you think you have IC, see a health care provider. They will first rule out other bladder conditions before diagnosing you with IC.
Treatment and recovery
There is no single treatment for people with IC. Your health care provider may develop a personalized treatment plan for you.
Your treatment plan may include:
Lifestyle changes like
Eating well.
Managing stress.
Being active.

Intimate Partner Violence Prevention
About Intimate Partner Violence
KEY POINTS
Intimate partner violence is a significant public health issue.
Intimate partner violence has a profound impact on lifelong health, opportunity, and well-being.
What is intimate partner violence?
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is abuse or aggression that occurs in a romantic relationship. Intimate partner refers to both current and former spouses and dating partners.
IPV can vary in how often it happens and how severe it is. It can range from one episode of violence to chronic and severe episodes over multiple years.
IPV can include any of the following types of behavior:
Physical violence is when a person hurts or tries to hurt a partner by using physical force.
Sexual violence is forcing or attempting to force a partner to take part in a sex act, sexual touching, or a non-physical sexual event (e.g., sexting) when the partner does not or cannot consent.
Stalking is a pattern of repeated, unwanted attention and contact by a partner that causes fear or concern for one's own safety or the safety of someone close to the victim.
Psychological aggression is the use of verbal and non-verbal communication with the intent to harm a partner mentally or emotionally or to exert control over a partner.
Quick facts and stats
IPV is common. It affects millions of people in the United States each year. Data from CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) indicate:1
About 41% of women and 26% of men experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime and reported a related impact.A
Over 61 million women and 53 million men have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
IPV starts early and continues throughout people's lives. When IPV occurs in adolescence, it is called teen dating violence. About 16 million women and 11 million men who reported experiencing intimate partner violence in their lifetime said that they first experienced it before age 18.1
While violence impacts all people, some individuals and communities experience inequities in risk for violence due to the social and structural conditions in which they live, work, and play. Youth from groups that have been marginalized are at greater risk of experiencing sexual and physical dating violence.2
Outcomes
Intimate partner violence can result in injuries and even death. Data from U.S. crime reports suggest that about one in five homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner. The reports also found that over half of female homicide victims are killed by a current or former male intimate partner.3
Many other negative health outcomes are associated with intimate partner violence. These include conditions affecting the heart, muscles and bones, and digestive, reproductive, and nervous systems, many of which are chronic.3
Survivors can experience mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. They are at higher risk for engaging in behaviors such as smoking, binge drinking, and risky sexual activity. People from groups that have been marginalized, such as people from racial and ethnic minority groups, are at higher risk for worse consequences.4
Although the personal consequences of intimate partner violence are devastating, there are also many costs to society. The lifetime economic cost associated with medical services for IPV-related injuries, lost productivity from paid work, criminal justice and other costs, is $3.6 trillion. The cost of IPV over a victim’s lifetime was $103,767 for women and $23,414 for men.5
Prevention
Intimate partner violence can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing intimate partner violence.
Preventing intimate partner violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence.
Promoting healthy, respectful, and nonviolent relationships and communities can help reduce the occurrence of intimate partner violence. It also can prevent the harmful and long-lasting effects of intimate partner violence on individuals, families, and communities.

Radiation and Your Health
How Food Irradiation Works
KEY POINTS
Food irradiation is a tool to help keep food safe from germs.
It does not change the texture or appearance of food.
Food does not become radioactive.
The process is safe and effective.
Overview
Food irradiation is a food safety process that uses radiation to kill germs that cause food poisoning (foodborne illness). Food irradiation is safe, and its safety and efficacy have been endorsed by federal agencies and intergovernmental organizations.
How it works
Food irradiation works by exposing food to ionizing electromagnetic (gamma or x-ray) radiation. Food irradiation is considered a ""cold"" method, meaning it does not use heat to kill germs. Other food safety processes that you may be more familiar with, like pasteurization and canning, use heat.
The irradiation process happens after a food is produced and packaged. Food enters a chamber where it is exposed to a specific amount of radiation. The radiation penetrates the food and kills germs or prevents them from multiplying, and it does not linger in the food. Irradiation is one more protective step, but it does not replace other food safety measures.
Irradiation Process
1. Foods such as fresh meat and spices leave processing facilities and arrive at facilities that use radiation to kill germs that can make you sick.
2. At the irradiation facility, foods ride on a conveyor belt through an irradiation chamber.
3. In the chamber, foods pass under a beam of radiation. This kills germs by breaking the bonds that hold the germ's DNA together.
4. Once the food leaves the irradiation chamber, most of the germs are destroyed.
5. The irradiated food goes to grocery stores and food service facilities.
6. You can identify irradiated foods by looking for the Radura symbol. It will be on the food label with one of these statements: ""Treated with Radiation"" or ""Treated by Irradiation.""
Impacts
Irradiation can make foods safer that are typically eaten raw, like some produce. Irradiation can also make raw foods that you cook at home, like ground beef, safer to handle. That's because irradiation kills most of the germs in the food before you buy it. Think of food irradiation as an added layer of protection against harmful germs that can make you sick.
What the research shows
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved food irradiation as a safe and effective process. Food irradiation has been evaluated for safety for over 30 years. Many agencies and organizations have endorsed its safety and effectiveness including:
Environmental Protection Agency
United States Department of Agriculture
World Health Organization
International Atomic Energy Agency
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Even astronauts eat irradiated food!
