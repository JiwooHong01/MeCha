Pregnancy and Vaccination
About Vaccines and Pregnancy
PURPOSE
Getting vaccinated while you’re pregnant helps your body create protective antibodies you can pass on to your baby. These antibodies can help protect your baby from those diseases during the first few months of life.

Things to Know
1. You aren't just protecting yourself—vaccines during pregnancy give your baby some early protection too!
Did you know a baby can get some disease protection from their mom during pregnancy? Getting flu, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19 vaccines while you're pregnant helps your body create protective antibodies (proteins produced by the body to fight off diseases), and you can pass on those antibodies to your baby. These antibodies can help protect your baby from those diseases during the first few months of life.
Vaccines during pregnancy give your baby some early protection too.
2. Flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccination while pregnant can help keep you and your little one safe.
CDC and a panel of experts who make vaccine recommendations have concluded that flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant women and their babies. These experts carefully reviewed the available safety data before recommending any vaccines during pregnancy.
Vaccines, like medicine, can have side effects. But most people who get vaccinated have mild or no side effects. CDC continually monitors vaccine safety, and the most common side effects of these vaccines include fever, tiredness, and body aches, as well as redness, swelling, and tenderness at the site where the shot was given.
Flu, Tdap, RSV, and COVID-19 vaccines are not harmful for pregnant women and their babies.
3. The Tdap vaccine helps protect against whooping cough, which can be really dangerous for your baby.
You'll need a Tdap vaccine during your pregnancy, with optimal timing between the 27th through 36th week of each pregnancy, preferably during the earlier part of this time period. Tdap helps protect against whooping cough (pertussis), which can be life-threatening for newborns.
About half of babies younger than 1 year old who get whooping cough need treatment in the hospital. The younger a baby is when they get whooping cough, the more likely the baby will need to be treated in a hospital. While some babies cough a lot, other babies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead, it can cause them to stop breathing and turn blue. Siblings, parents, or caregivers who don't know they have whooping cough can infect babies since the disease often causes only mild symptoms in older children and adults.
Tdap helps protect against whooping cough (pertussis), which can be life-threatening for newborns.
4. Getting a flu vaccine while pregnant can help protect you and your baby against flu.
Changes in your immune, heart, and lung functions during pregnancy make you more likely to get seriously ill from flu. Pregnancy increases the risk of being hospitalized with the flu and having flu-related complications if you get sick with the flu. Flu may also be dangerous for your pregnancy. Fever during pregnancy, for any reason, has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Additionally, babies are more likely to get very sick from flu. Flu vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. When you get a flu vaccine during pregnancy, you pass antibodies along to your baby that can help protect them from flu in the first few months after they're born, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves.
Get a flu shot if you are pregnant during flu season—it's the best way to protect yourself and your baby from flu. Flu vaccine is safe during pregnancy and can be given during any trimester.
When you get a flu vaccine during pregnancy, you pass antibodies along to your baby that can help protect them from flu in the first few months after they're born.
5. Getting an RSV vaccine during your pregnancy or getting your baby an RSV immunization can help protect your baby
RSV is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants. Babies infected with RSV can have difficulty breathing and eating and sometimes may need respiratory support or hydration in the hospital. There are two ways to protect your baby from getting very sick with RSV. You can choose to get RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of your pregnancy during September to January, or your baby aged 8 months or younger can get RSV immunization during their first RSV season.
Getting an RSV vaccine during your pregnancy or getting your baby an RSV immunization can help protect your baby.
6. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant can help protect you and your baby from getting very sick from COVID-19.
If you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 than women who are not pregnant. Additionally, if you have COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are more likely to have complications that can affect your pregnancy and developing baby.
COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, including women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future. Evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe and effective and suggests that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential risks. New data show that vaccination during pregnancy can help protect babies younger than 6 months old, when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves, from hospitalization due to COVID-19.
Everyone, including women who are pregnant, should stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines, including getting an updated vaccine when it's time to get one.
COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, including women who are pregnant or might become pregnant in the future.
7. Timing of vaccinations is everything!
You know all about timing. Week after week, you are tracking your baby's growth and development and counting down the days until you meet your little one! When it comes to vaccines, timing is also important.
Flu seasons vary in their timing from season to season. For most people, CDC recommends getting the flu vaccine in September or October to ensure that they are protected before flu activity begins to increase. Early vaccination during July and August also can be considered for women who are in the third trimester of pregnancy during those months.
Instead of during a specific time of year, CDC recommends you get your Tdap vaccine in each pregnancy, ideally between the 27th and 36th week. Getting Tdap during this period preferably during the earlier part, helps pass the greatest amount of protective antibodies to your baby before birth. This will help protect your baby during their first few months of life when they are most vulnerable to serious disease and complications.
You can get your RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy during September to January, or your baby aged 8 months or younger can get RSV immunization during their first RSV season.
You can get your updated COVID-19 vaccine at any point in pregnancy.
When it comes to vaccines, timing is important.
8. Anyone who is around your baby needs vaccines too.
Newborns do not yet have fully developed immune systems, making them particularly vulnerable to infections. Older kids and adults can spread viruses to babies, even if they don't feel very sick. Because of this, anyone who is around babies should be up to date on all recommended vaccines. This includes parents, siblings, and any other caregivers, like grandparents, or babysitters. Anyone who needs vaccines should get them at least two weeks before meeting the baby because it takes about two weeks to develop antibodies after vaccination.
Anyone who is around babies should be up to date on all recommended vaccines.
9. If you get pregnant again, you'll need a Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy.
The amount of antibodies you have in your body after getting vaccinated decreases over time. When you get a vaccine during one pregnancy, your antibody levels may not stay high enough to provide enough protection during future pregnancies, even if your babies are close in age. So, make sure you give baby number 2 (and 3 and 4…) the greatest amount of protective antibodies and the best disease protection possible by getting your Tdap vaccine each time you are pregnant. You should also get a flu shot every flu season, and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.
You'll need a Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy.

About the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
AT A GLANCE
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is one of several different systems CDC uses to monitor the safety of vaccines.
VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event).
Anyone — patients, family members, healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers — can submit a report to VAERS. Healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers are legally required to report certain events after vaccination.
A report to VAERS does not mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event.
If it looks as though a vaccine might be associated with a health problem, CDC and FDA investigate further and take action if needed.
Overview
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS
) is the nation's early warning system that monitors the safety of FDA-approved vaccines and vaccines authorized for use for public health emergencies. The system accepts and analyzes reports of possible adverse events after vaccination and is co-managed by CDC and FDA. The number of reports submitted varies each year. VAERS accepts reports regardless of seriousness or how likely the vaccine may have caused the adverse event.
A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event.
A VAERS report alone does not indicate whether a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event. Only scientists and public health professionals can make this determination after thorough investigation.
Most VAERS reports involve mild side effects such as fever, arm soreness or mild irritability. Federal law defines reports of certain adverse events as serious reports. These include reports of the following after vaccination:
Permanent disability.
Hospitalization.
Extension of an existing hospitalization.
Life-threatening illness.
Congenital (present at birth) deformity/birth defect.
Death.
VAERS staff attempt to collect additional information from healthcare providers and clinicians about adverse events described in serious reports. While serious adverse events can happen after vaccination, they are rarely caused by the vaccine.
Report an adverse event to VAERS
Anyone can submit a report to VAERS. Learn more about which adverse events to report and how to report them.
VAERS: Access and Use
What data VAERS collects
The type of vaccine received.
The date of vaccination.
When the adverse event began.
Current illnesses and medications.
Medical history.
Past history of adverse events following vaccination.
Demographic information.
How data collection works
VAERS is a passive surveillance system, meaning it relies on people sending in reports of their experiences after vaccination.
Keep Reading:
About CDC’s Vaccine Safety Monitoring Program
How the data are used
CDC and FDA use VAERS reports to:
Assess the safety of newly licensed or authorized vaccines.
Detect new, unusual or rare adverse events that happen after vaccination.
Monitor increases in known side effects, like arm soreness where a shot was given.
Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of health problems related to vaccines.
Identify and address possible reporting clusters.
Recognize safe-use problems and administration errors.
Watch for unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports.
Serve as a vaccine safety monitoring system in public health emergencies.
Add to and improve scientific literature
and understanding of vaccine safety monitoring.
Signals
Patterns or an unusually high number of adverse events reported for a vaccine are called ""signals."" If they detect a signal, scientists may conduct further studies in VSD or CISA to find out if it represents an actual risk. CDC and FDA investigate further and act if needed.
Strengths and limitations of VAERS data
When evaluating VAERS data, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations.
Strengths
VAERS accepts reports from anyone. This also allows VAERS to act as an early warning system to detect rare adverse events.
VAERS collects information about the vaccine, the person vaccinated, and the adverse event. Scientists obtain follow-up information on serious reports.
All data from the initial VAERS report (without identifying patient information) are available to the public.
Limitations
VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected. Instead, someone who had or is aware of an adverse event following vaccination must file a report.
Anyone can submit VAERS reports. Some reports can lack details or contain errors. After investigation, scientists find that most events reported to VAERS are not associated with vaccination.
The number of reports submitted to VAERS can change in response to media attention and public awareness. Such changes in reporting can complicate interpretation of VAERS data.
When more people hear about vaccine side effects, they may report any health outcomes they experience after vaccination.
This increase in reporting can complicate detecting patterns of adverse events that should be further assessed in a strong, reliable data analysis system.
Such increased reporting can also create the misconception that vaccines are dangerous, leading to fear and hesitation about vaccination.
It is usually not possible to use VAERS data to calculate how often an adverse event occurs in a population.
The number of people receiving a vaccine is usually not available (a notable exception was during the COVID-19 public health emergency when the number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered was reliably reported to CDC).
VAERS data alone cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event. Establishing a causal relationship requires rigorous scientific assessment and consideration of multiple factors beyond just VAERS reports alone.
A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event
VAERS accepts all reports of adverse events following vaccination without judging whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. Some VAERS reports might represent true vaccine reactions or side effects; others might be coincidental adverse events not related to vaccination.
This limitation has caused confusion about the publicly available data.

Vaccines & Immunizations
Vaccine Basics
WHAT TO KNOW
Modern vaccines contain only the ingredients that are needed for the vaccines to be as safe and effective as possible.
Every vaccine ingredient serves a purpose
To provide immunity
We become immune to (or protected from) a disease when our bodies create specific antibodies to fight that disease. Vaccines contain ingredients that help your body build this immunity.
To keep the vaccine safe and long-lasting
Vaccines need to be safe and effective. Certain ingredients help keep vaccines safe from contamination and toxins. Others, like stabilizers, help vaccines stay effective for a long time.
To make the vaccine more effective
All vaccine ingredients help to make a vaccine as effective as possible, while being safe. Ingredients like aluminum salt help boost the body's response to the vaccine.
Ingredients found in some vaccines
Stabilizers
Purpose: To keep the vaccine effective after manufacturing
Most commonly found in: Jell-O®, naturally in the body
Examples: Sugars, gelatin
Adjuvants
Purpose: To help boost the body's response to the vaccine
Most commonly found in: Drinking water, infant formula, and some health products such as antacids, buffered aspirin, and antiperspirants
Examples: Aluminum salts
Residual inactivating ingredients
Purpose: To kill viruses or inactivate toxins during the manufacturing process
Most commonly found in: Naturally in the human body, fruit, household furnishings (carpets, upholstering)
Example: FormaldehydeA
Residual cell culture materials
Purpose: To grow enough of the virus or bacteria to make the vaccine
Most commonly found in: Eggs, and foods that contain eggs
Examples: Egg proteinB
Residual antibiotics
Purpose: To prevent contamination by bacteria during the vaccine manufacturing process
Most commonly found in: Common antibiotics. Antibiotics that people are most likely to be allergic to—like penicillin—aren't used in vaccines.
Examples: Neomycin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin
Preservatives
Purpose: To prevent contamination
Most commonly found in: Some kinds of fish
Example: ThimerosalC (only in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine)
Most vaccines don't contain any mercury
Most vaccines do not have any mercury in them. However, multi-dose flu vaccines and one type of tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine contain a small amount of thimerosal. Thimerosal contains a form of mercury (ethylmercury) that does not cause mercury poisoning and is safe for use in vaccines. Flu and Td vaccines are also available in thimerosal-free versions.
Different types of vaccines work in different ways
Vaccines can help protect against certain diseases by imitating an infection. This helps teach the immune system how to build immunity to fight off a future infection. Different vaccines provide immunity in different ways.
Ingredients in specific vaccines
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is responsible for making sure vaccines are safe and effective, has information about all approved vaccines. Check out the below links to discover the different vaccine options and the various ingredients.
Learn about the vaccines that are currently approved in the U.S. by the FDA to prevent different diseases.

Vaccine Administration Management System (VAMS) Program Information
PURPOSE
Overview of the Vaccine Administration Management System (VAMS), an online tool to manage vaccine administration from the time the vaccine arrives to patient administration.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), other federal agencies, and state public health departments need real-time or near-real-time data on early mass COVID-19 vaccine administration. Federal response leaders expect dose-level accountability, from the time vaccine leaves the manufacturer until vaccine is administered.
Our current nationwide network of immunization information systems (IISs) cannot consistently provide real-time data, so CDC developed the Vaccine Administration Management System (VAMS) to meet this need.
VAMS is an easy-to-use, secure, online tool to manage vaccine administration from the time the vaccine arrives at a clinic until it is administered to a recipient. VAMS is free for public health-approved clinics, and can be used on computers, tablets, and other mobile devices. It is not a smartphone app, and no installation or download is required for this web-based platform. VAMS has robust security that is shared with Amazon Web Services, which is certified by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). The guidelines used for VAMS hardware and/or software components are covered in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 Revision 4, which addresses 376 Security Controls covering all security concerns to address the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information contained within VAMS.
Timely gathering of vaccination data for analysis is critical in ongoing vaccination efforts. VAMS allows for gathering and analysis of real-time or near-real-time vaccination data in vaccination clinics.
Participation in VAMS is currently limited to jurisdictions, federal agencies, and organizations, that have enrolled in VAMS and to the individuals who live, work, or volunteer in those organizations and jurisdictions. VAMS is also available for use in traditional medical practices that do not have existing IT systems for COVID-19 vaccination clinic management.
VAMS is free for public health-approved clinics, and can be used on computers, tablets, and other mobile devices. It is not a smartphone app, and no installation or download is required for this web-based platform.
If a jurisdiction or federal agency is interested in implementing VAMS please contact your CDC IIS subject matter experts or CDC federal program liaison. For multistate healthcare systems interested in implementing VAMS, please see below for additional contact information.

Vaccine Safety
Vaccine Recalls: Frequently Asked Questions
WHAT TO KNOW
Many types of products including cars, toys, and food products are sometimes recalled for short times or withdrawn permanently from the market because they don't work properly or pose a safety risk. Although every vaccine goes through years of testing before being used, vaccines or vaccine lots (specific batches) can also be withdrawn or recalled.
Why would a vaccine, or certain batches of a vaccine, be withdrawn or recalled?
There have been only a few vaccine recalls or withdrawals due to concerns about either how well the vaccine was working or about its safety. Several vaccine lots have been recalled in recent years because of a possible safety concern before anyone reported any injury. Rather, the manufacturer's quality testing noticed some irregularity in some vaccine vials. In these cases, the safety of these vaccines was monitored continuously before and after they were in use. CDC analyzed reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to search for any side effects that might have been caused by the irregularity, and found none. Any time such an irregularity is found in a vaccine lot which could make it unsafe, the manufacturer, in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will recall it immediately. Information on recalled lots of is available by year from FDA.
How is a vaccine recalled?
Vaccine recalls or withdrawals are almost always initiated voluntarily by the vaccine manufacturer. The FDA rarely issues a recall, and if safety is a concern, the recall is immediate. The manufacturer contacts vaccine distributors and healthcare facilities who might have purchased the vaccine to inform them of the suspected problem. Whenever a vaccine lot is to be recalled, FDA's role is to oversee a manufacturer's strategy and help ensure the recall goes well.
How is a vaccine recall communicated?
You would most likely hear from your doctor if a vaccine given to you or your child is recalled. When a recalled product has been widely distributed, the news media often reports on the recall. Not all recalls are announced in the media, but all recalls are listed in FDA's weekly Enforcement Reports
. Also, information on vaccines that have been recalled in the past few years is available at FDA's Recalled Vaccines
page.
What do I do if a vaccine is recalled?
In many cases, the person who is vaccinated will not need to do anything after a vaccine is recalled.
When a vaccine recall is due to low vaccine potency or strength, vaccines from the lot might not produce an immune response that is strong enough to protect against disease. People who were vaccinated with a vaccine from that lot might need to be vaccinated again to ensure they are protected against the disease.
When a recall is related to a possible safety concern noted by the manufacturer, people who were vaccinated should be aware of their reaction to the vaccine, and talk to their doctor if they have any concerns that they may be having a reaction.

Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine Safety
SAFETY INFORMATION BY VACCINE |
KEY POINTS
You can protect against measles, mumps, and rubella with vaccination.
Overview
Measles causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Complications can include ear infection, diarrhea, pneumonia, brain damage, and death.
Mumps causes fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen salivary glands. Complications can include swelling of the testicles or ovaries, deafness, inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis) and, rarely, death.
Rubella, causes fever, sore throat, rash, headache, and red, itchy eyes. If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage, or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.
Due to high vaccination rates, outbreaks of measles, mumps, and rubella in the U.S. are not as common as they were before the vaccine began being used. However, these diseases still appear in the U.S. and people who decide not to vaccinate their children because of religious or personal beliefs put their children and others at risk for getting these diseases.

Vaccine Information Statement
Common side effects
Sore arm from the shot.
Fever.
Mild rash.
Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women who did not already have immunity to the rubella component of the vaccine.
Some people may experience swelling in the cheeks or neck. MMR vaccine rarely causes a temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder that usually goes away without treatment and is not life threatening.
Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella.
When to call 911
Severe allergic reactions following vaccination are rare, but can be life threatening. If someone experiences symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, which can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness.
MMR vaccine has been linked with a very small risk of febrile seizures. Febrile seizures following MMR vaccination are rare and are not associated with any long-term effects. Because the risk of febrile seizures increases as infants get older, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as soon as recommended.
Extremely rarely, a person may have a serious allergic reaction to MMR vaccine. Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine.
Report possible adverse events to VAERS
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is an early warning system, co-managed by CDC and FDA, that monitors for potential vaccine safety problems. Healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers are required by law to report certain adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event) following vaccination to VAERS; patients and caregivers can also submit reports.
Submitting a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Report and Using VAERS Data
A closer look at the safety data
Two studies indicate that for every 10,000 children who get their first MMR and varicella vaccines as separate shots when they are ages 12-23 months, about four will have a febrile seizure during the 7-10 days following vaccination. Children of the same age who get the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine as their first vaccine against these diseases are twice as likely to have a febrile seizure during the same time period.12
Studies have shown that for children younger than 7 years old, there is a very small increased risk of febrile seizures approximately 6 to 14 days after MMR vaccination; this happens in about 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 children.
Joint pain is associated with the rubella portion of MMR vaccine among people who do not have immunity to rubella. Joint pain and temporary arthritis happen more often after MMR vaccination in adults than in children. Women also experience this reaction more often than men. Joint pain or stiffness occurs in up to 1 in 4 of females past puberty who were not previously immune to rubella; their symptoms generally begin 1 to 3 weeks after vaccination, are usually mild and last about 2 days. These symptoms rarely come back.
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder that decreases the body's ability to stop bleeding. It can happen after both natural measles infection as well as after getting the MMR vaccine. However, it is usually not life threating. Treatment may include blood transfusion and medications. The risk of ITP has been shown to be increased in the six weeks following an MMR vaccination, with one study estimating 1 case per 40,000 vaccinated children.
Measles inclusion body encephalitis, or severe brain swelling caused by the measles virus, is a complication of getting infected with the wild-type measles virus. While rare, this disorder almost always happens in patients with weakened immune systems. The illness usually develops within 1 year after initial measles infection and has a high death rate. There have been three published reports of this complication happening to people who are vaccinated. In these cases, encephalitis developed between 4 and 9 months after MMR vaccination. In one case, the measles vaccine strain was identified as the cause.
Safety studies
Adverse events
The most common adverse events following the MMR vaccine are pain where the vaccine is given, fever, a mild rash, and swollen glands in the cheeks or neck.
Studies have shown a small increased risk of febrile seizures occurs among children who are younger than 7 years old approximately 8-14 days after vaccination at a rate of one for every 3,000-4,000 children vaccinated with MMR vaccine. This is compared to children not vaccinated during the preceding 30 days.
Separating MMR vaccine shots
No published scientific evidence shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots.
Outbreaks
Measles outbreaks can occur in communities with a high number of unvaccinated people. Maintaining high overall MMR vaccination rates is needed to continue to limit the spread of measles.
Autism
Because signs of autism may appear around the same time children receive the MMR vaccine, some parents may worry that the vaccine causes autism. Vaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for recent increases in the number of children with autism. In 2004, a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that there is no link between autism and MMR vaccine, and that there is no link between autism and vaccines that contain thimerosal as a preservative.
Fact
Many carefully performed scientific studies have found no link between MMR vaccine and autism.3456

COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Reporting Systems
WHAT TO KNOW
Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccinations.
COVID-19 vaccines used in the response to the pandemic underwent the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. Safety monitoring used established systems.
CDC provides timely updates on selected adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event) reported to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccination.
Monitoring process
After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, vaccine safety systems monitor adverse events (rare health conditions) and watch for potential safety problems.

Possible Side Effects from Vaccines
KEY POINTS
Any vaccine can cause side effects.
Listed below are vaccines licensed in the United States and side effects that have been associated with each of them.
Vaccines are continually monitored for safety.
Summary
Any vaccine can cause side effects. For the most part these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days. Listed below are vaccines licensed in the United States and side effects that have been associated with each of them. This information is copied directly from CDC's Vaccine Information Statements (VISs), which in turn are derived from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for each vaccine.
Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for safety, and like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk and could put the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Vaccines
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS |
KEY POINTS
SIDS is the sudden, unexpected death of a baby younger than 1 year of age that doesn’t have a known cause even after a complete investigation.
Multiple research studies and safety reviews have found that vaccines do not cause and are not linked to SIDS.
Overview
Babies receive multiple vaccines when they are between 2 to 4 months old. This age range is also the peak age for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The timing of the 2 month and 4 month shots and SIDS has led some people to question whether they might be related. However, studies have found that vaccines do not cause and are not linked to SIDS.
Multiple research studies and safety reviews have looked at possible links between vaccines and SIDS. The evidence accumulated over many years do not show any links between childhood immunization and SIDS.
Steps you can take
Fact
Placing healthy babies on their backs to sleep reduces the risk of SIDS.
In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that healthy babies be placed on their backs to sleep. That recommendation, along with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's 1994 ""Back-to-Sleep"" campaign (now known as the Safe to Sleep® campaign
), encouraged caregivers to place infants on their backs to sleep, and coincided with a dramatic reduction in the SIDS rate in the United States. See the latest recommendations on a safe infant sleep environment
from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Also, research has found the rate of SIDS declined dramatically following the 1994 ""Back-to-Sleep"" campaign, and then stabilized in the 2000s at a time when the number of infant immunizations was increasing. The findings provide strong evidence that immunization is not linked to SIDS. See the published article on SIDS rates.

Vaccine Safety
Thimerosal and Vaccines
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS |
KEY POINTS
Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that has been used for decades in the United States in multi-dose vials (vials containing more than one dose) of medicines and vaccines.
There is no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines, except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site.
In July 1999, the Public Health Service agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines as a precautionary measure.
Overview
About thimerosal
Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust, air, soil, and water. Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed — methylmercury and ethylmercury — are very different.
Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic to people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible out of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some methylmercury.
Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body more quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm.
Purpose of thimerosal
Thimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) to prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi.
Introduction of bacteria and fungi has the potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for administration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, serious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added during the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth.
Removal of thimerosal
Fact
Thimerosal was taken out of childhood vaccines in the United States in 2001.
Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines do not and never did contain thimerosal.
Varicella (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal.
Influenza (flu) vaccines are currently available in both thimerosal-containing (for multi-dose vaccine vials) and thimerosal-free versions.
For a complete list of vaccines and their thimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Thimerosal in Vaccines
page.
What the research shows
Fact
Thimerosal use in medical products has a record of being very safe. Data from many studies show no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines.123456
The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people may be allergic to thimerosal.
No connection with autism
Research does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Many well conducted studies have concluded that thimerosal in vaccines does not contribute to the development of autism.135 Even after thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to increase, which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism.
Fact
A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal does not increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1
No association with neuropsychological delays
Studies have assessed the possible association between ethyl mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and neuropsychological functioning including an objective measurement of neuropsychological functioning.
Fact
Research shows no association between thimerosal exposure and neuropsychological delays.24
Timeline: Thimerosal in Vaccines
2010
September 13. Results of a CDC study do not support an association between prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal and an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
2009
February 1. Results of an Italian study
 were reassuring that immunization in infancy with thimerosal-containing vaccines does not decrease neuropsychological performance later in childhood.
2007
September 27. Results of a CDC study
 do not support an association between early exposure to thimerosal in vaccines and neuropsychological problems in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years.
July 7. CDC issues a statement on autism and thimerosal that states in part: “Some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal (from the addition of important vaccines recommended for children) explains the higher prevalence [of autism] in recent years. However, evidence from several studies examining trends in vaccine use and changes in autism frequency does not support such an association.”
2006
September 26. In a statement prepared for the Coalition for Mercury-free Drugs, the FDA concludes that the evidence reviewed by the IOM in 2004 does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.
2004
May 28. ACIP recommends that children between the ages of 6 and 23 months routinely receive an inactivated influenza (flu) vaccine. ACIP does not recommend using the thimerosal-free flu vaccine over the thimerosal-containing flu vaccine, and states that the benefits of flu vaccination outweigh any risk from thimerosal exposure.
May 17. After reviewing over 200 scientific studies that examined thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, IOM concludes in a report
 that the studies “consistently provided evidence of no association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.”
2003
November. A study
 finds no consistent significant associations between exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines and a variety of kidney, nervous system, and developmental problems.
August. Another study
 looks for a link between autism incidence and the use of thimerosal-containing vaccines. The study does not find a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism in Denmark and Sweden, where autism rates continued to increase although thimerosal was removed from vaccines in 1992.
January. The last children’s vaccines that use thimerosal as a preservative expire 
.
2001
Except for influenza (flu), thimerosal is removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and under manufactured for the U.S. market.
October 1. IOM’s Immunization Safety Review Committee issues a report
 concluding there is not enough evidence to disprove claims that thimerosal in childhood vaccines causes autism, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, or speech or language delay.
May 5. A risk assessment
 of thimerosal use in childhood vaccines finds no evidence of harm from the use of thimerosal as a preservative, other than redness and swelling at the injection site.
2000
June 7 and 8. Fifty-one vaccine and vaccine safety researchers and experts meet in Atlanta, GA to review data regarding thimerosal in vaccines and nervous system disorders. A report summarizing the meeting was presented to ACIP.
1999
The FDA reviews
 the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines and finds no evidence of harm, but as a precautionary measure, recommends removing thimerosal from vaccines routinely given to infants.
November 5. CDC states that vaccine manufacturers, FDA, and other agencies are working together to reduce the amount of thimerosal in vaccines, or to replace them with thimerosal-free vaccines, as soon as possible.
October 20. ACIP reviews information about thimerosal in vaccines provided by CDC’s National Immunization Program and several vaccine manufacturers regarding the availability of vaccines that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative.
July 7. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service issue a joint statement that says “There is no data or evidence of any harm caused by the level of exposure that some children may have encountered in following the existing immunization schedule.” The American Academy of Family Physicians issues a comparable statement soon after.
Frequently asked questions
What is thimerosal?
Thimerosal is a vaccine additive, added to some vaccines to prevent germs (like bacteria and fungi) from growing in them. If germs grow in vaccines, they can cause illness—or even death.
Why do some people worry about thimerosal in vaccines?
You may have heard that thimerosal has mercury in it. Not all types of mercury are the same. Some types of mercury, like mercury in some kinds of fish, stay in the human body and can make people sick. Thimerosal is a different kind of mercury. It doesn’t stay in the body, and is unlikely to make us sick.
Is thimerosal safe?
Yes. Thimerosal has been used safely in vaccines for a long time (since the 1930s).
Scientists have been studying the use of thimerosal in vaccines for many years. They haven’t found any evidence that thimerosal causes harm.
Is thimerosal still used in vaccines for children?
No. Thimerosal hasn't been used in vaccines for children since 2001.
However, thimerosal is still used in some flu vaccines. Yearly flu vaccines are recommended for all children. If you are worried about thimerosal, you can ask for a flu vaccine without it.
Does thimerosal cause autism?
No. Research does not show any link between thimerosal and autism.
Keep Reading:
Vaccines and Autism
Are there side effects from thimerosal in vaccines?
Most people don't have any side effects from thimerosal, but some people will have mild side effects like redness and swelling at the place where the shot was given, which will only last 1 to 2 days. It's very unlikely you will have an allergic reaction to thimerosal.
How can I find out if thimerosal is in a vaccine?
Ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Ask to see the vaccine's list of ingredients. All vaccine packages come with information (called an insert) that lists the ingredients.

What CDC is doing
Fact
CDC and FDA closely monitor the safety of all vaccines.
CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are committed to ensuring that vaccines provided to the public are safe and effective. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized for emergency use in the United States, CDC and FDA continuously monitor them through several safety systems.
Vaccines for Children Program
Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program: Information for Providers
WHAT TO KNOW
The VFC Program provides all routine vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at no cost to participating healthcare providers.
The VFC Program Benefits Your Patients and Your Practice
Many parents can’t afford to pay for vaccines on their own. Being a VFC Program provider is a sound investment in your practice and your patients’ health. Here are some of the benefits of participating in the VFC Program:
Reduces your up-front costs because you will not have to pay to purchase vaccines for VFC Program-eligible children.
Enables your patients to get the vaccines they need during routine appointments at their regular office.
Helps provide quality care to vulnerable children and adolescents.

Addendum: Special Considerations for COVID-19 Vaccine and Nirsevimab
Enrolling in the VFC Program is a Simple Process
You don't have to be a Medicaid provider to participate in the VFC Program. Any healthcare provider (including pharmacists) authorized by their state law granting them the authority to administer vaccines by prescription, vaccine protocol, or prescribing authority can be a VFC Program provider. To enroll in the VFC Program:
Contact your state/local/territory VFC Program coordinator
to request enrollment.
Complete and return the State Provider Enrollment forms as soon as possible.
Prepare for a site visit to go over the program's administrative requirements and proper storage and handling of vaccines once you have completed and returned the enrollment forms.
Administration Fees for VFC Program Vaccines
VFC Program providers cannot charge their patients for any vaccines given to eligible children. However, they can charge for other fees associated with a vaccination appointment. Types of fees a provider can charge:
A set or standard fee to administer each vaccine.
An office visit fee.
Fees for non-vaccine services that occur during a vaccination appointment, like an eye exam or a blood test.
If a parent or guardian cannot afford the fee (per vaccine), this fee must be removed so that they are not charged. A VFC Program provider cannot refuse vaccination for a VFC Program-eligible child due to the parent's or guardian's inability to pay for vaccine administration.
Annual Training Opportunities for VFC Program Providers
All VFC providers are required to participate in annual, comprehensive training. VFC providers should check with their state, local, or territorial immunization program regarding requirements.
CDC offers training modules and refresher test options that may fulfill these requirements.
Providers can complete one or two VFC-related modules in the You Call the Shots course series. Continuing education (CE) credit is offered for each module.
You Call the Shots Storage and Handling Module
You Call the Shots VFC Training Module
Experienced healthcare professionals familiar with VFC and federal storage and handling requirements can opt to take a refresher test to demonstrate their knowledge on these Note: No continuing education credits will be awarded for completing either refresher test.

Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis)
Valley Fever Prevention for Workers
KEY POINTS
Coccidioidomycosis or Valley Fever is an infectious disease in parts of the United States.
It is caused by breathing fungal spores.
Certain jobs and work activities put workers at risk for the disease.
It is important to take special measures to prevent exposure.
Where it's found
Endemic areas for Valley Fever in the United States.
Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, is an infectious disease caused by breathing spores from Coccidioides fungi. It is endemic in the southwestern U.S., including Arizona and California.
Who is at increased risk
Bulldozer pushing dirt.
Workers in endemic areas exposed to dust from disturbed soil are at a higher risk for Valley Fever.1, 2, 3 Examples include workers in the following fields:
Agriculture
Archeology
Construction
Geology
Military
Firefighting
Mining, gas, and oil extraction
Preventing exposure
It is important for workers to understand potential hazards related to their work and how to protect themselves. Steps for minimizing exposures include:
Stop work in dust storms or high winds.
Minimize hand digging.
Dig with equipment that has enclosed, air-conditioned, HEPA-filtered cabs.
Continuously wet soil while digging or moving earth.
Stay upwind of digging when possible.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has a Hazard Communication Standard known as the Right to Know Law
. This standard requires employers to provide employees with information about potential work hazards. It also requires employee training on safe work practices, procedures, and protective measures.
Respiratory protection is recommended for those who:
Dig manually
Dig using equipment, including enclosed heavy equipment
Work near earth-moving trucks or equipment in endemic areas
Respirators for employees should be certified by NIOSH and provided with a comprehensive respiratory protection program. This includes:
Medical clearance for using respirators
Initial and periodic training and fit testing
Monitoring for respirator effectiveness
The OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard
describes components of a comprehensive respiratory protection program. Employers should assess risks and determine appropriate respiratory protection for dusts and spores. Respirator information can be found on the NIOSH website.
Employers should:
Wash equipment before it is moved offsite.
Require workers to change clothing and shoes at the worksite.
Arrange prompt medical evaluation and treatment of those with possible disease.
The CDC Valley Fever web page provides further general information about Valley Fever.
Staphylococcus aureus
About Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
KEY POINTS
Infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) are exceptionally rare.
If you suspect you have a Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection, see a healthcare provider.
Overview
Vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA/VRSA) are specific types of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria.
Resistance to vancomycin in S. aureus is exceptionally rare.
Signs and symptoms
VISA/VRSA infections can look like pimples, boils or other skin conditions. VRSA can cause wound infections.
Who is at risk
People with underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes and kidney disease).
People with tubes going into their bodies (e.g., catheters).
People with previous methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.
People who have recently taken vancomycin or other antibiotics.
How it spreads
Documented transmission of VRSA has not occurred in the U.S. VRSA could potentially spread in the same ways as MRSA (e.g., close physical contact with patients, contaminated material like bandages).
Prevention
Caregivers, visitors and anyone who has close physical contact with hospital patients infected with VISA/VRSA should:
Keep their hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid contact with other people's wounds or material contaminated from wounds.
Follow the hospital's recommended precautions when visiting a patient.
Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices (such as wearing gloves before and after contact with infectious body substances and adherence to hand hygiene) to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Testing
Clinical diagnostic testing can determine if a patient has VISA/VRSA and help providers choose the right treatment.
Keep Reading:
Staphylococcus aureus Testing Procedures for Laboratory Personnel
Treatment and recovery
All VISA and VRSA isolates in the U.S. have been susceptible to several FDA-approved drugs.
What CDC is doing
Tracking VRSA infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by VRSA and slow the spread of resistant germs.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE)
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) Basics
KEY POINTS
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) infections usually occur in healthcare settings.
Good infection control practices can prevent cases.
Antibiotics can treat VRE infections.
Overview
Enterococci are bacteria normally found in the human intestines, female genital tract and environment (e.g., soil and water). VRE are resistant to vancomycin, the drug often used to treat infections caused by enterococci. Most VRE infections occur in hospitals.
In 2017, VRE caused an estimated 54,500 infections among hospitalized patients and 5,400 estimated deaths in the United States.1
Who is at risk
People who have taken antibiotics, including vancomycin, for long periods of time.
People who have had surgery.
People with medical devices in their bodies (e.g., catheters).
Hospital patients, especially those with weakened immune systems.
How it spreads
Contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment.
Person-to-person contact, often via contaminated hands.
VRE does not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing.
Reducing risk
Patients and caregivers should:
Regularly clean their hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Clean their hands before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device, after using the bathroom and before cooking.
Wear gloves whenever they might come into contact with body fluids (e.g., stool (poop) or bandages from infected wounds).
Inform healthcare providers if they or someone they care for has VRE.
Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting.
Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Treatment and recovery
VRE infections are treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. To pick the best antibiotic, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory.
In some cases, people can carry VRE without being infected, known as colonization. Colonization does not require antibiotics.
What CDC is doing
Tracking VRE infections through the National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by VRE and slow the spread of resistant germs.

The bottom line
There are no safe tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.
E-cigarettes should not be used by youth, young adults, or women who are pregnant.
Adults who have never smoked or used other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, should not start.
E-cigarettes may have the potential to benefit adults who smoke and are not pregnant if they are used as a complete substitute for smoked tobacco products. However, no e-cigarette has been approved by the FDA as a smoking cessation aid.
More research is needed to better understand the short- and long-term health effects of using e-cigarettes as well as whether e-cigarettes can be effective at helping adults quit smoking.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)
About Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)
KEY POINTS
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a rare disease caused by a prion, an infectious protein.
It is linked to eating beef from cows infected with ""mad cow disease.""
It is always fatal, usually within 14 months of the first symptoms.
vCJD illnesses have been very rare since the early 2000s.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
vCJD is a rare, fatal brain disease that occurs in people. It has been linked to eating meat from cows infected with another prion diseases, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). BSE is sometimes called ""mad cow disease.""
vCJD was first reported in the United Kingdom in 1996. Worldwide, there have been 233 people reported to have vCJD since its discovery. The vast majority of illnesses occurred in the United Kingdom in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There were also cases reported in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, the United States and Canada.
It can take years for someone to develop vCJD symptoms after they were exposed to BSE. But, once symptoms begin, it is always fatal. Most people with vCJD live with the illness for one to two years, with an average time of 13-14 months.
Signs and symptoms
As with other prion diseases, it takes a long time for people to get sick after contact with the prion. This timeframe can be 10 years or more.
People with vCJD have obvious psychiatric (mental, emotional, behavioral) symptoms. Often, this includes depression, anxiety and withdrawal.
They may also have a painful condition called dysesthesia. This may feel like itching, burning, pins and needles or other sensations on their body.
Later in the illness, patients typically have dementia and neurologic signs such as poor coordination.
Reported cases
Of the 233 vCJD illnesses reported since 1996, four vCJD illnesses have been reported in the United States. Three occurred between 2001 and 2006. A fourth had vCJD symptoms beginning in 2012.
It is believed that all four people with vCJD in the U.S. contracted the disease in another country. Two of the four patients had lived for decades in the United Kingdom. A third was born and raised in Saudi Arabia before coming to the United States. It's not clear where the fourth patient may have been exposed, but experts agreed it was likely outside the US.
A few more recent vCJD illnesses occurred in lab personnel and may have been exposed to prions in the lab.
Causes
There is strong evidence vCJD is caused when people eat meat from cows that were infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
BSE was first identified in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and cases peaked in the early 1990s. The first vCJD cases were reported in 1996.
Feeding cattle meat and bone meal from dead cows, some of which had BSE, contributed to the large U.K. outbreak.
Policies to prevent further exposure of animals and humans to BSE led to a dramatic decline in BSE cases. These included animal feed bans and the removal of infectious cattle tissues, such as the brain, from human food.
Scientists believe people may have eaten food potentially contaminated with BSE in the mid-1980s. vCJD cases started appearing about 10 years later. This matches the usual incubation period (the time between exposure and symptoms) for other prion diseases.
Prevention
Preventing vCJD primarily involves avoiding BSE. Given the how rare BSE is and protective measures in place, there are no specific vCJD prevention measures needed now.
Diagnosis
There is no specific test to diagnose vCJD while a patient is alive.
Healthcare providers look at a number of factors when deciding if someone has vCJD:
The patient's age
Their symptoms
Brain activity tests before death
Whether symptoms lasted more than one year
Whether another disease could have caused the illness.
To confirm the patient had vCJD, scientists must examine brain tissue gathered during an autopsy. They look for changes in the brain that are specific to vCJD.
Treatment
There is unfortunately no cure for vCJD. No specific therapy slows or stops the disease's progression once symptoms begin.
Treatment involves providing supportive care to help make the person more comfortable as their illness progresses.
Similar diseases
Though they have very similar names, vCJD is not the same disease as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The latter is often called ""classic CJD"" to avoid confusion.
Both are caused by prions, misfolded proteins that clump together in brain tissue. As they do, they cause brain damage. Over time, the brain damage gets worse, eventually causing the person's death.
Some of the differences between the two diseases include:
vCJD typically affects a much younger age group (average age 28 vs 68)
vCJD has different initial symptoms (psychiatric/behavioral vs dementia).
The two diseases affect the brain differently.
vCJD causes death > one year after illness onset (vs. 4-5 months for CJD)

Information on Swine / Variant Influenza
About Swine/Variant Flu
WHAT TO KNOW
Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs.
Influenza viruses that commonly circulate in swine are called “swine influenza viruses” or “swine flu viruses.”
Like human influenza viruses, there are different subtypes and strains of swine influenza viruses.
The main swine influenza viruses circulating in U.S. pigs in recent years have been, swine triple reassortant (tr) H1N1 influenza virus, trH3N2 virus, and trH1N2 virus.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called ""variant viruses."" They also can be denoted by adding the letter ""v"" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States.

Chickenpox Vaccination
KEY POINTS
Two doses of the chickenpox vaccine are recommended for children by doctors as the best way to protect against chickenpox (varicella).
People who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get 2 doses.
Most people who get the vaccine will be protected for life and not get chickenpox.
Introduction
The best way to protect against chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe illness. Instead of MMRV, some children might receive separate vaccines for MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and varicella (chickenpox).
If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, called breakthrough chickenpox, the symptoms are usually mild. Vaccinated people often experience fewer to no blisters and low or no fever, but red spots may occur.

Impact of U.S. Chickenpox Vaccination Program
Available vaccines
There are two chickenpox vaccines licensed in the United States. The chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Your healthcare provider can give you more information.
Varivax®
Contains only chickenpox vaccine.
Is licensed for use in people 12 months or older.
Can be given to children for their routine 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at 12–15 months old and age 4–6 years old.
ProQuad®
Contains a combination of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines, which is also called MMRV.
Is only licensed for use in children 12 months–12 years old.
Recommendations
Children under 13 years old should get 2 doses.
12–15 months old
1st dose
4–6 years old
2nd dose
People 13 years and older who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get 2 doses. The doses should be at least 28 days apart. People should also get a second dose if they have had only one chickenpox dose. Instead of MMRV, some children might receive separate vaccines for MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and varicella.
After exposure to someone with chickenpox
Getting vaccinated after you are exposed to someone with chickenpox can:
Prevent the disease or make it less serious.
Protect you from chickenpox if you are exposed again in the future.
A healthcare provider can prescribe a medicine to make chickenpox less severe if you:
Are exposed to chickenpox.
Do not have immunity against the disease.
Are not eligible for vaccination.
Why getting vaccinated is important
Chickenpox is usually mild. However, it can be serious during pregnancy, in infants under 12 months old, adolescents, adults, and people with weakened immune systems.
Some people get so sick that they need to be hospitalized. It doesn’t happen often, but people can die from chickenpox. Most people who are vaccinated with 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine will be protected for life.
Chickenpox is a mild disease for many children, but not for all. There's no way to know who will have a serious case. With vaccination, your children get immunity from chickenpox without the risk of serious complications caused by the disease itself.
Who should get vaccinated
Everyone should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine if they have never had chickenpox or were never vaccinated.
Chickenpox vaccination is especially important for:
Healthcare professionals
Anyone who cares for or are near people with weakened immune systems
Residents and staff in nursing homes and other residential settings
Teachers, childcare workers, & anyone living with children
College students
Inmates and staff of correctional institutions
International travelers
Military personnel
Non-pregnant women of childbearing age
Who shouldn't get vaccinated
Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine, or they should wait. Check with your healthcare provider if you:
Have HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system.
Are being treated with drugs that affect the immune system for 2 weeks or more.
Have any kind of cancer.
Are getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs.
Recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products.
Are pregnant or may be pregnant.
The vaccine is safe and effective
The chickenpox vaccine is safe, and it is effective at protecting against chickenpox. Vaccines, like a medicine, can have side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own.
Two doses of the vaccine are about 90% effective at preventing chickenpox. When you get vaccinated, you protect yourself and others in your community, especially people who cannot get vaccinated. Since the chickenpox vaccination program began in the United States, there has been over 97% decrease in chickenpox cases. Hospitalizations and deaths have become rare.

Possible side effects
Most people don't have any side effects from the vaccine. The side effects that do occur are usually mild, and may include:
Soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given
Fever
Mild rash
Finding and paying for the vaccine
Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers.

Where to Find Vaccines
Vaccine costs
There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines:
Health insurance
Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children Program
Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines.

Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
About Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
KEY POINTS
About 1 in every 3 people in the United States will have shingles (or herpes zoster) in their lifetime.
Shingles can sometimes lead to serious complications like long-term nerve pain and vision loss.
The best way to protect yourself from shingles is vaccination.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Shingles is a painful rash illness. People get shingles when the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox, reactivates in their bodies after they have already had chickenpox.
An estimated 1 million people get shingles each year in this country. Most people who develop shingles only have it one time during their life. However, you can have shingles more than once.
Signs and symptoms
People with shingles most commonly have a rash around the left or right side of the body. The rash is usually painful, itchy, or tingly.
Shingles can lead to serious complications. The most common shingles complication is long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN.
Keep Reading:
Shingles Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
You are at risk for shingles if:
You have had chickenpox.
More than 99% of Americans born before 1980 had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it. Children can have shingles, but it is not common.
Your risk of shingles and serious complications increases:
As you get older.
If you have medical conditions that keep your immune systems from working properly such as certain cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, and HIV infection.
If you take drugs that keep your immune system from working properly, like steroids and drugs given after an organ transplant.
Causes and spread
If you are near someone with shingles:
You cannot get shingles from someone who has shingles.
You can get chickenpox from someone who has shingles if you never had chickenpox or never got chickenpox vaccine. You could then develop shingles later in life.
Shingles is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus stays in their body. The virus can reactivate later in life and cause shingles.
People who never had chickenpox or didn't get chickenpox vaccine can get infected with VZV from someone who has shingles. These people can get the virus through:
Direct contact with the fluid from shingles rash blisters.
Breathing in virus particles that come from the blisters.
People with chickenpox are more likely to spread VZV than people with shingles.

About Chickenpox
Prevention
Protect yourself with the vaccine. CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy.
Keep Reading:
Shingles Vaccine Recommendations
The best way to prevent shingles is by getting 2 doses of the vaccine.
If you have shingles, protect others
Covering the shingles rash can lower the risk of spreading the shingles virus to others. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before the blisters appear or after the rash scabs over.
To prevent spreading the virus to others:
Cover the rash
Avoid touching or scratching the rash
Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds
Avoid contact with the following people until your rash scabs over
Pregnant women who never had chickenpox or chickenpox vaccine
Premature or low birth weight infants
People with weakened immune systems
Treatment and recovery
Several antiviral medicines are available to treat shingles:
Acyclovir (ay-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Valacyclovir (va-luh-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Famciclovir (fam-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
These medicines shorten the length and severity of the illness. They work best when you take them as soon as the rash appears. If you think you have shingles, contact your doctor as soon as possible to talk about treatment.
Pain relief medicine may help with the pain caused by shingles. This can be over the counter or a prescription from your doctor. Wet compresses, calamine lotion, and warm oatmeal baths may help relieve itching.

Smallpox
About Smallpox
KEY POINTS
Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by the variola virus.
Smallpox has been eradicated, with no cases occurring since 1977.
The disease caused rashes and could spread through coughing and sneezing.
Smallpox no longer occurs naturally, but it is possible that variola virus could be used in a biological attack. Although unlikely, public health authorities prepare for the possibility of smallpox being used as a weapon.

Public Health
Overview
Before smallpox was eradicated, it was a serious infectious disease caused by the variola virus. It was contagious—meaning, it spread from one person to another. People who had smallpox had a fever and a distinctive, progressive skin rash.
Most people with smallpox recovered, but about 3 out of every 10 people with the disease died. Many smallpox survivors have permanent scars over large areas of their body, especially their faces. Some are left blind.
Thanks to the success of vaccination, smallpox was eradicated, and no cases of naturally occurring smallpox have happened since 1977. The last natural outbreak of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949. The World Health Assembly declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.

Outdoor Workers
Venomous Snakes at Work
KEY POINTS
Venomous snakes can be dangerous to outdoor workers.
Although most people do not die from snake bites, there can be lasting effects.
Employers and workers can take actions to stay safe.
Overview
Venomous snakes found in the United States include:
Rattlesnakes
Copperheads
Cottonmouths/water moccasins
Coral snakes
Each year, 7,000–8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States. About 5 of those people die. More people would die if they did not seek medical care.
Workers are more likely to suffer long-term injuries than to die from snake bites. For those bitten by rattlesnakes, 10–44 percent will have lasting injuries. For example, they may lose all or part of a finger or lose the ability to use it.
Types
Rattlesnakes
Rattlesnake, Photo courtesy of Sean P. Bush
The largest venomous snakes in the United States. Many species live in the United States.
Can quickly and accurately strike one-third or more of their body length from any position (coiled or stretched out).
May use their rattles as a warning if they are feeling threatened.
Do not always rattle before biting.
Can be found sunning near logs, boulders, or open areas.
Found across the United States in mountains, prairies, deserts, and beaches.
Antivenom is recommended for the treatment of signs of progressive envenomation (e.g., worsening of local tissue injury, systemic symptoms).
Copperheads
Copperhead, Photo courtesy of Sean P. Bush
Vary in color from reddish to golden tan.
Colored bands on their bodies are typically hourglass-shaped.
Have a deep facial pit between each eye and their nostril.
Adults are about 1.5 – 3 feet long.
Not usually aggressive, but will freeze if frightened, and strike if they feel threatened.
Found in Eastern states and as far west as Texas in forests, rocky areas, swamps, and near water.
If bitten, receiving antivenom as soon as possible helps limbs to recover faster and it lessens the chance that a limb will be disabled after copperhead snake envenomation.
Cottonmouths/Water Moccasins
Cottonmouth, Photo courtesy of Sean P. Bush and Frederick S. Boyce
Adults are typically over 4 feet long.
Adults are dark tan, brown, or nearly black, with vague black or dark brown cross-bands.
Juveniles have a bold cross-banded pattern of brown or orange with a yellow tail.
Found in the Southeastern United States in or around water.
Coral Snakes
Coral snake, Photo courtesy of Mike Cardwell and Elda Sánchez
Sometimes confused with nonvenomous king snakes, which have similar colored bands.
May hide in leaf piles or burrow into the ground.
Found in the Southern United States in wooded, sandy, or marshy areas.
Symptoms
Signs or symptoms of a snake bite can vary depending on the type of snake.
Around the wound, you may experience:
Puncture marks
Bleeding, redness, swelling, bruising, or blistering
Severe pain and tenderness
After a snake bite, you may experience:
Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
Trouble seeing or breathing
In extreme cases, breathing may stop
Rapid heart rate, weak pulse, low blood pressure
Metallic, mint, or rubber taste in the mouth
Increased salivation and sweating
Numbness or tingling around face and/or limbs
Muscle twitching

Prevention
What employers can do
Employers can protect their workers from venomous snake bites by training them about:
Their risk of being bitten by venomous snakes.
How to identify venomous snakes.
How to prevent snake bites.
What they should do if they see a snake or if a snake bites them.
What workers can do
Do not touch or handle any snake.
Stay away from tall grass and piles of leaves when possible.
Avoid climbing on rocks or piles of wood where a snake may be hiding.
Be aware that snakes tend to be most active at dawn and dusk and in warm weather.
Wear boots and long pants when working outdoors.
Wear leather gloves when handling brush and debris.
First Aid
If a snake bites you:
Seek emergency medical attention as soon as possible to start antivenom (if needed) and stop irreversible damage.
Do not drive yourself to the hospital because the snakebite can make you dizzy or pass out.
Take a photograph from a safe distance to identify the snake if possible, which may aid in faster treatment.
Keep calm.
Inform your supervisor.
Apply first aid while waiting for someone to take you to the hospital.
Lay or sit down with the bite in a neutral position of comfort.
Remove rings and watches before swelling starts.
Wash the bite with soap and water.
Cover the bite with a clean, dry dressing.
Mark the leading edge of tenderness/swelling on the skin and write the time alongside it.
Do not do any of the following:
Do not pick up the snake or try to trap it.
NEVER handle a venomous snake, not even a dead one or its decapitated head.
Do not wait for symptoms to appear; get medical help right away.
Do not apply a tourniquet, electric shock, or folk therapies.
Do not slash the wound with a knife or cut it in any way.
Do not try to suck out the venom.
Do not apply ice or immerse the wound in water.
Do not drink alcohol as a painkiller or take pain relievers (such as, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen).

Outdoor Workers
Venomous Spiders at Work
KEY POINTS
Outdoor workers may encounter venomous spiders.
Black widows and brown recluses are some types of venomous spiders in the United States.
Employers and workers can take steps to prevent spider bites.
Overview
Venomous spiders found in the United States include the black widow and the brown recluse. These spiders can be dangerous to outdoor workers. Spiders are usually not aggressive, and most bites occur because a spider is trapped or touched.
Types
Black widow spiders
Have a pattern of red coloration on the underside of their abdomen.
Build webs between objects.
Bites may occur when contact is made with their webs.
Bites have two puncture marks.
The venom is a neurotoxin that produces pain at the bite area and then spreads to the chest, abdomen, or the entire body.
Found:
Throughout North America, but are most common in the southern and western United States.
In workplaces containing undisturbed areas such as woodpiles, eaves, fences, and areas where debris has accumulated.
Living in outdoor toilets where there are lots of flies.
Brown recluse spiders
Also known as the violin spider.
Brown with a dark violin-shaped marking on its head.
Has six equal-sized eyes (most spiders have eight eyes).
Cannot bite humans without counterpressure, like if it is accidentally trapped against the skin.
Bites may cause a stinging sensation with localized pain. A small white blister usually develops at the site of the bite.
The venom can cause a severe lesion by destroying skin tissue (skin necrosis). This skin lesion will require professional medical attention.
Found:
In the midwestern and southern United States.
In workplaces with secluded, dry, sheltered areas such as under structures or logs or in piles of rocks or leaves.
Indoors in dark closets, shoes, or attics.
Symptoms
Symptoms associated with spider bites can vary from minor to severe. Although extremely rare, death can occur in the most severe cases.
Possible symptoms resulting from a spider bite include:
Itching or rash
Pain radiating from the bite, muscle pain, or muscle cramping
Reddish to purplish color or blister
Sweating, fever, or chills
Difficulty breathing
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
Anxiety or restlessness
High blood pressure
Prevention
Employers can protect their workers from spider bites by training them on:
Their risk of exposure to spiders.
How to identify spiders.
How to prevent exposure to spiders.
What they should do if they are bitten by a spider.
Workers can take the following preventive steps:
Inspect or shake out any clothing, shoes, towels, or equipment before use.
Wear protective clothing such as a long-sleeved shirt and long pants, hat, gloves, and boots when handling stacked or undisturbed piles of materials.
Minimize the empty spaces between stacked materials.
Remove and reduce debris and rubble from around the outdoor work areas.
Trim or eliminate tall grasses from around outdoor work areas.
Store apparel and outdoor equipment in tightly closed plastic bags.
Keep tetanus boosters up-to-date (every 10 years). Spider bites can become infected with tetanus spores.
First Aid
If a worker is bitten by a spider:
Stay calm.
Identify the type of spider if it is possible to do so safely to aid in medical treatment.
Wash the bite area with soap and water.
Apply a cloth dampened with cold water or filled with ice to the bite area to reduce swelling.
Elevate bite area if possible.
Do not attempt to remove venom.
Immediately notify a supervisor and seek professional medical attention.

Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP)
Ventilator-associated Pneumonia Basics
KEY POINTS
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can develop when a patient is on a ventilator.
VAP can be treated with antibiotics.
There are ways to reduce the risk of a patient contracting VAP.
Overview
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a type of healthcare-associated infection (HAI). It is a lung infection that develops in a person who is on a ventilator.
Causes
VAP happens when bacteria get into a patient's lungs and cause an infection.
Reducing risk
Quit smoking. Patients who smoke get more infections. Seek information about how to quit before surgery.
Ask healthcare providers to clean their hands before touching the patient or equipment.
Ask about raising the head of the bed.
Ask when the patient can try breathing without a ventilator.
Ask how often healthcare providers clean the patient's mouth.
Healthcare providers should always follow Core Infection Prevention and Control Practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Acute care hospitals should use strategies to prevent VAP
.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment generally includes antibiotics, but the type of antibiotic depends on the bacteria causing the infection. The healthcare provider will decide which antibiotic is best.
What CDC is doing
Tracking VAP infections through the National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by VAP and slow the spread of resistant germs.

KEY POINTS
Traveling on cruise ships exposes people to new environments and high volumes of people, including other travelers.
This exposure can create the risk for illness from contaminated food, or water or, more commonly, through person-to-person contact.
CDC helps the cruise ship industry prevent and control public health issues on cruise ships.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Information for passengers
CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP)A helps the cruise industry prevent and control public health issues. We also provide information for passengers:
Tips on healthy cruising, including what to do if you get sick onboard
Cruise ship inspection scores and reports, including violations and recommendations to address them
Information on outbreaks we investigate
Information about the eight areas we inspect aboard cruise ships
Did you know?
In 2022, approximately 12.5 million passengers embarked from North American ports for their cruise vacation1. Traveling on cruise ships exposes people to new environments and high volumes of people, including other travelers. This exposure can create the risk for illness from contaminated food or water or, more commonly, through person-to-person contact.
How we help prevent and control illnesses
Sick people can spread gastrointestinal illnesses to others through food and water and by touching handrails, elevator buttons, shared utensils, and other people. Other public health issues on cruise ships can include controlling Legionella, managing pests and insects, and ensuring clean air and water.
VSP helps the cruise industry prevent and control the spread of illnesses by:
Inspecting cruise ships to determine how well ships are operating and maintaining public health standards in eight major areas
Monitoring data on illnesses and investigating and responding to outbreaks
Reviewing ship design and construction plans for compliance with public health standards in five general areas
Training cruise ship leaders, staff, and designers on public health practices
Building the evidence base for environmental public health practices on cruise ships
CDC also tracks other issues on cruise ships. Learn more about other common health concerns during cruise travel and what you can do to prevent illness.

Vaccines for Children Program
Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program: Information for Providers
WHAT TO KNOW
The VFC Program provides all routine vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at no cost to participating healthcare providers.
The VFC Program Benefits Your Patients and Your Practice
Many parents can’t afford to pay for vaccines on their own. Being a VFC Program provider is a sound investment in your practice and your patients’ health. Here are some of the benefits of participating in the VFC Program:
Reduces your up-front costs because you will not have to pay to purchase vaccines for VFC Program-eligible children.
Enables your patients to get the vaccines they need during routine appointments at their regular office.
Helps provide quality care to vulnerable children and adolescents.

Addendum: Special Considerations for COVID-19 Vaccine and Nirsevimab
Enrolling in the VFC Program is a Simple Process
You don't have to be a Medicaid provider to participate in the VFC Program. Any healthcare provider (including pharmacists) authorized by their state law granting them the authority to administer vaccines by prescription, vaccine protocol, or prescribing authority can be a VFC Program provider. To enroll in the VFC Program:
Contact your state/local/territory VFC Program coordinator
to request enrollment.
Complete and return the State Provider Enrollment forms as soon as possible.
Prepare for a site visit to go over the program's administrative requirements and proper storage and handling of vaccines once you have completed and returned the enrollment forms.
Administration Fees for VFC Program Vaccines
VFC Program providers cannot charge their patients for any vaccines given to eligible children. However, they can charge for other fees associated with a vaccination appointment. Types of fees a provider can charge:
A set or standard fee to administer each vaccine.
An office visit fee.
Fees for non-vaccine services that occur during a vaccination appointment, like an eye exam or a blood test.
If a parent or guardian cannot afford the fee (per vaccine), this fee must be removed so that they are not charged. A VFC Program provider cannot refuse vaccination for a VFC Program-eligible child due to the parent's or guardian's inability to pay for vaccine administration.
Annual Training Opportunities for VFC Program Providers
All VFC providers are required to participate in annual, comprehensive training. VFC providers should check with their state, local, or territorial immunization program regarding requirements.
CDC offers training modules and refresher test options that may fulfill these requirements.
Providers can complete one or two VFC-related modules in the You Call the Shots course series. Continuing education (CE) credit is offered for each module.
You Call the Shots Storage and Handling Module

Cholera
About Cholera
KEY POINTS
Cholera is a bacterial disease spread through contaminated water and food.
Cholera can cause severe diarrhea, dehydration, and even death if the disease goes untreated.
People living in places with unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene are at highest risk of cholera.
What it is
Cholera is an infection of the intestines caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. You can get cholera from drinking water or eating food containing cholera bacteria.
Most people who get cholera don't get sick. However, cholera can cause life-threatening watery diarrhea and vomiting. Every year, an estimated 1.3 to 4 million people around the world get cholera, and between 21,000 to 143,000 people die.
With early and proper treatment, even severely ill patients can survive cholera.
Signs and symptoms
Most people who get cholera have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. About 1 in 10 people develop severe symptoms such as watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Losing body fluids quickly can lead to dehydration and shock.
Keep Reading:
Signs and Symptoms of Cholera
Who is at risk
People living in areas with unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene are at highest risk of getting cholera.
U.S. residents can get cholera while traveling abroad and sometimes become ill after returning home. Some travelers have gotten sick after bringing contaminated seafood home with them from abroad.
Keep Reading:
About Cholera in the United States
How it spreads
People usually get cholera from drinking water or eating food that contains traces of poop from someone with cholera. The disease can spread quickly in areas where sewage and drinking water aren't adequately treated.
Cholera bacteria also can live in brackish (slightly salty) and coastal waters. Eating raw shellfish can cause cholera.
Cholera is not likely to spread from person to person or from casual contact with someone with cholera.
Keep Reading:
Cholera: Causes and How It Spreads
Prevention
Using treated water helps prevent cholera.
If you plan to travel, check if cholera is common or ongoing in the area you are visiting. If cholera is present, washing your hands with soap and safe water, drinking treated water, and getting vaccinated against cholera are among the steps that can help prevent you from getting sick.

Vibrio Infection (Vibriosis)
About Vibrio Infection
KEY POINTS
Vibrio are bacteria that naturally live in coastal waters.
About a dozen kinds of Vibrio can cause people to get an infection called vibriosis.
People can get vibriosis after swallowing Vibrio or getting it in a wound.
Vibrio infection can be serious. Know when to seek medical care.
Overview
What are Vibrio?
Vibrio are bacteria that naturally live in certain coastal waters. They are found in higher numbers in May through October, when water temperatures are warmer.
Coastal waters include salt water and brackish water. Brackish water is a mixture of salt water and fresh water. It is often found where rivers meet the ocean.
What is vibriosis?
About a dozen species (kinds) of Vibrio can cause a human illness called vibriosis. The most common species causing human illness in the United States are
Vibrio parahaemolyticus
Vibrio vulnificus
Vibrio alginolyticus
Keep in mind
This site focuses on vibriosis. Other strains of Vibrio can cause a human illness called cholera.
How do people get vibriosis?
Most people get vibriosis by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters.
Some people get vibriosis after an open wound comes in contact with coastal waters.
How common is vibriosis?
CDC estimates that:
80,000 cases of vibriosis happen each year in the United States.
52,000 cases of vibriosis are the result of eating contaminated food.

Complications
Some Vibrio species, such as Vibrio vulnificus, can cause severe and life-threatening infections.
Some Vibrio infections lead to necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection in which the flesh around an open wound dies. Some media reports call Vibrio vulnificus ""flesh-eating bacteria."" However, public health experts believe group A Streptococcus are the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis in the United States.
Many people with Vibrio vulnificus infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill.
When to seek emergency care
Immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of a Vibrio bloodstream or wound infection. Do not wait.
People at risk
Anyone can get a Vibrio infection.
Some medical conditions and treatments can increase your risk for infection and severe complications. They include:
Having liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, or thalassemia
Receiving immune-suppressing therapy for the treatment of disease
Taking medicine to decrease stomach acid levels
Having had recent stomach surgery
Some behaviors also can increase your risk of infection. These include:
Eating raw seafood, particularly oysters
Exposing an open wound to coastal waters
Exposing an open wound to raw seafood or its drippings
Diagnosis and testing
Infection is diagnosed when Vibrio are found in the wound, blood, or stool (poop) of an ill person.
If you have signs and symptoms of infection, be sure to tell your healthcare provider if
You recently ate raw or undercooked seafood, especially oysters
You have an open wound that might have come in contact with
Coastal water, including sale water or brackish water
Raw or undercooked seafood or its drippings
Treatment
Antibiotics are not recommended to treat mild Vibrio infections. People with diarrhea or vomiting should drink plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration. Dehydration is not having enough fluids in the body.
Antibiotics can be used to treat severe or prolonged Vibrio infections.
Vibrio wound infection is treated with antibiotics and surgery to remove dead or infected tissue. Surgery might include amputation.

The term ""viral hemorrhagic fever"" refers to a condition where many of the body's organ systems are affected, the overall cardiovascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to function on its own is reduced.
In addition to VHFs, there are serious infectious diseases like Nipah and Hendra diseases that also require a specialized laboratory, are highly pathogenic, and have no, or limited, vaccine or treatment currently available.
VHFs, Nipah and Hendra disease can cause relatively mild illness or more life-threatening disease. Symptoms can vary but may include bleeding or hemorrhaging. Distribution of these viruses is determined by where the animals that naturally carry them live.

Types
Most VHFs fall into one of four families of virus:
Arenaviruses
Each arenavirus has one or a few closely related rodents that carry the virus without getting sick themselves. This is known as the reservoir, or source of the virus in nature. The reservoir can spread the virus to people through infected urine, saliva, or droppings, and can cause severe disease in people.
People are infected with arenaviruses by:
Touching with rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials from an infected rodent
Breathing in air contaminated by rodent urine, droppings or nesting materials.
Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent.
Eating food contaminated by urine, droppings, or saliva from an infected rodent.
Contact with another person who has certain arenaviruses, such as Chapare, Lassa, Machupo, and Lujo viruses.
Bunyavirales order
Viruses in the Bunyavirales order are spread by rodents or insects, such as mosquitos, ticks, or sand flies. They can produce mild to severe disease in animals and people. Many of these viruses cannot spread between people. However, person-to-person spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has occurred in healthcare settings where infection control was limited.
Filoviruses
Filoviruses can cause severe illness in people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and gorillas). The Egyptian rousette bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is a cave-dwelling bat, and the reservoir for Marburg virus. Bats infected with orthomarburgviruses do not show obvious signs of illness. It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that bats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they can spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Caretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection.
Flaviviruses
Flaviviruses, are found throughout the world. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to severe disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large economic and social impact on people living in affected areas.
Paramyxoviruses
Paramyxoviruses can cause sudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within the Paramyxoviridae family, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because they require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.

Prevention
Prevention of VHFs and other HCIDs depends on the host reservoir and how the virus spreads. Prevention measures can target reservoir exclusion activities (for example, use of insect repellents, bed nets, and protective clothing and disinfection procedures while caring for a sick person) or by sealing up and setting traps in homes and other buildings when a rodent infestation is discovered.

Meningitis
About Viral Meningitis
KEY POINTS
Meningitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.
A bacterial or viral infection can cause the swelling.
Viral meningitis is the most common type of meningitis.
Most people get better on their own without treatment, but it can be very serious.
What it is
Many viruses can cause meningitis. Leading U.S. causes include:
Arboviruses, such as West Nile virus
Herpesviruses
Influenza virus
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
Measles virus
Mumps virus
Non-polio enteroviruses (most common)
Herpesviruses include:
Epstein-Barr virus
Herpes simplex viruses
Varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles)
Symptoms
People with viral meningitis usually start having typical meningitis symptoms.
When to seek emergency care
Anyone with symptoms of meningitis should see a healthcare provider right away. A healthcare provider can determine if you have meningitis, what's causing it, and the best treatment.
Risk factors
Anyone can get viral meningitis; however, the following factors can increase someone's risk.
Age
Children younger than 5 years old are at increased risk for viral meningitis.
Babies younger than 1 month old are most likely to have severe illness if they get viral meningitis.
Medical conditions
People with a weakened immune system are at increased risk for getting viral meningitis and having severe illness. Diseases, some medications (such as chemotherapy), and recent organ or bone marrow transplantations can weaken the immune system.
Close contacts aren't likely to develop meningitis
Close contacts of someone with viral meningitis can become infected with the virus that made that person sick. They aren't likely to develop meningitis though.
How it spreads
The table below summarizes the most common ways these viruses spread. Visit specific CDC websites for more detailed information.
Arboviruses
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
Spread through specific animal exposures, including bites, urine, or feces
Epstein-Barr virus
Mumps virus
Non-polio enteroviruses
Spread by sharing respiratory or throat secretions (saliva or spit) through close contact
Spread by items contaminated with those secretions
Influenza virus
Measles virus
Varicella-zoster virus
Spread through coughing, sneezing, or talking
Don't require close contact
Varicella-zoster viruses
Spread through contact with fluid from blisters
Non-polio enteroviruses
Spread through contact with other body secretions (feces, nasal mucus)
Spread by items contaminated with those secretions (diapers
Prevention
Limit virus exposure and spread
Many daily healthy habits can help prevent viral infections:
Wash your hands often, especially after changing diapers or using the toilet
Avoid close contact, such as touching and shaking hands, with people who are sick
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces
Stay home when sick and keep sick children out of school
Keep Reading:
About Handwashing
Vaccination
Vaccines can protect against some diseases that can lead to viral meningitis:
Chickenpox vaccines
Influenza vaccines
Measles and mumps vaccines
Shingles vaccines
Other prevention tips
Avoid bites from mosquitoes and other insects that carry diseases that can infect humans.
Avoid contact with wild mice. Take precautions when handling pet rodents like mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs.
Keep Reading:
Controlling Wild Rodent Infestations
Testing and diagnosis
There are laboratory testsingitis.
Treatment and recovery
In most cases, there's no specific treatment for viral meningitis. Most people with mild viral meningitis usually get better on their own within 7 to 10 days.
People who develop severe illness, or are at risk for developing severe illness, may need hospital care.
Antiviral medicines
Antiviral medicine may help people with meningitis caused by viruses such as herpesvirus and influenza.

Staphylococcus aureus
About Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
KEY POINTS
Infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) are exceptionally rare.
If you suspect you have a Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection, see a healthcare provider.
Overview
Vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA/VRSA) are specific types of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria.
Resistance to vancomycin in S. aureus is exceptionally rare.
Signs and symptoms
VISA/VRSA infections can look like pimples, boils or other skin conditions. VRSA can cause wound infections.
Who is at risk
People with underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes and kidney disease).
People with tubes going into their bodies (e.g., catheters).
People with previous methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.
People who have recently taken vancomycin or other antibiotics.
How it spreads
Documented transmission of VRSA has not occurred in the U.S. VRSA could potentially spread in the same ways as MRSA (e.g., close physical contact with patients, contaminated material like bandages).
Prevention
Caregivers, visitors and anyone who has close physical contact with hospital patients infected with VISA/VRSA should:
Keep their hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid contact with other people's wounds or material contaminated from wounds.
Follow the hospital's recommended precautions when visiting a patient.
Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices (such as wearing gloves before and after contact with infectious body substances and adherence to hand hygiene) to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Testing
Clinical diagnostic testing can determine if a patient has VISA/VRSA and help providers choose the right treatment.
Keep Reading:
Staphylococcus aureus Testing Procedures for Laboratory Personnel
Treatment and recovery
All VISA and VRSA isolates in the U.S. have been susceptible to several FDA-approved drugs.
What CDC is doing
Tracking VRSA infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by VRSA and slow the spread of resistant germs.

Volcanoes and Your Safety
KEY POINTS
You can do many things to protect yourself and your family from the dangers of a volcanic eruption.
The best way to protect yourself and your family is to follow the advice of local officials.
Major health threats
Inhaling volcanic gases and ash can be harmful to your health.
Volcanoes spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava, and rock that are powerfully destructive. People have died from volcanic blasts.
Natural threats caused by volcanic eruptions
Volcanic eruptions can result in additional threats to health, such as:
Floods
Mudslides and landslides
Power outages
Drinking water contamination
Wildfires
Health concerns
Health concerns after a volcanic eruption include:
Infectious disease
Respiratory illness
Burns
Injuries from falls
Vehicle accidents related to the slippery, hazy conditions caused by ash
When warnings are heeded, the chances of adverse health effects from a volcanic eruption are very low.
Volcanic ash
Exposure to ash can be harmful. Ash is gritty, abrasive, sometimes corrosive, and always unpleasant. Small ash particles can abrade (scratch) the front of the eye. Ash particles may contain crystalline silica, a material that causes a respiratory disease called silicosis.
People most at-risk
Infants, elderly people, and people with respiratory conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and other chronic lung diseases may have problems if they breathe in volcanic ash.
Gases
Most gases from a volcano quickly blow away. However, heavy gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide can collect in low-lying areas. The most common volcanic gas is water vapor, followed by carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.
Other volcanic gases include hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen fluoride. Amounts of these gases vary widely from one volcanic eruption to the next.
Health effects
Although gases usually blow away rapidly, it is possible that people who are close to the volcano or who are in the low-lying areas downwind may be exposed to levels that may affect health.
At low levels, gases can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. At higher levels, gases can cause rapid breathing, headache, dizziness, swelling and spasm of the throat, and suffocation.
Sulfur dioxide can cause breathing problems in both healthy people and people with asthma and other respiratory problems.

Chemical Emergencies
VX
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
VX is a human-made chemical warfare agent.
It is one of the most toxic nerve agents.
Signs and symptoms depend on how much you were exposed to, how you were exposed, and for how long.
Get clean and get medical help if exposed.
Background
VX is a human-made chemical warfare agent that is one of the most toxic nerve agents.
Like all nerve agents, VX stops certain enzymes from working. When this enzyme does not work correctly, muscles are constantly being used. As a result, people may become tired and no longer be able to keep breathing.
VX can remain in the environment from days to months depending on the circumstances.
VX's characteristics include:
Oily liquid
Amber in color
Tasteless
Odorless
Slow to evaporate and become a vapor (gas)
It evaporates as slowly as motor oil.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms depend on how much a person was exposed to, how the person was exposed, and for how long.
VX has no recognizable smell. Until signs and symptoms develop, people may not know that they were exposed.
Exposure to a low or medium amount may cause some or all the following signs and symptoms within seconds to hours:
Abnormally low or high blood pressure
Blurred vision, eye pain, and/or eye tearing
Chest tightness
Confusion
Cough
Diarrhea
Drooling
Difficulty breathing
Drowsiness
Excessive sweating
Fast or slow heart rate
Headache
Increased urination
Muscle cramps
Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain
Rapid breathing
Runny nose
Shortness of breath
Small, pinpoint pupils
Tremors
Weakness
Wheezing
Even a small drop of VX on the skin can cause sweating and muscle twitching where VX touched the skin.
Exposure to large amount of VX in any way may result in the following harmful health effects:
Loss of consciousness
Cardiac arrest (heart stopping) possibly leading to death
Coma
Convulsions (muscle shaking)
Paralysis (inability to move)
Respiratory (breathing) failure possibly leading to death.
Seizures
Twitching
Exposure
Because VX evaporates slowly, VX can be a short-term threat or a long-term threat. VX can stay on surfaces and be dangerous for days to months.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
Air
If VX is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the VX gas. Because VX gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase the chance of exposure there.
Water
If VX is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the water. People can also be exposed to liquid VX by swallowing it, getting it on their skin, or in their eyes.
Clothes
People can also touch or breathe in VX gas from clothes that have been exposed to VX.
Food
Touching or eating food with VX can also expose people to VX. Avoid using or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched VX if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by VX. Wash the outside of the container before using.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the VX was released and breathe fresh air.
If the VX release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the VX does not come inside.
If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the VX was released. If you cannot get away from the area, go to the highest ground possible. VX is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas.
If the VX release was indoors, get out of the building.
Make sure you understand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency broadcasts and local authorities for instructions.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. This is the best way to remove VX from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take your clothes off
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the VX from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
Follow these steps to blot your body:
Use dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Use a different cloth or towel for each body part.
Blot your head and hair.
Blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds.
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
Use lukewarm water and mild soap to wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body for about 90 seconds. Wash from your head to your feet, including armpits and groin. Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10 to 15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch VX. Tell local authorities where the bags are for pick up.
Get help
If you think you were exposed
Get clean first. Then get help by calling 911 or going to the nearest hospital (if local officials say it is safe to leave). Call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for more information.
Treatment
Treatment involves removing VX from the body as soon as possible. Treatment also involves giving supportive medical care in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel.
Antidotes (cures) for VX are available in a healthcare setting. They are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.
Reminder
If someone has swallowed VX, do not force vomiting.
Long-term health effects
VX breaks down slowly in the body. If you are exposed to VX or other nerve agents multiple times, it can build up in the body.
People who were exposed to low amounts usually recover.
People who were exposed to higher amounts of VX may experience chronic or long-lasting symptoms. These symptoms include:
Muscle weakness
Paralysis
Pain
Pins and needles sensations
People who received very high doses are less likely to survive.

Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
About Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
KEY POINTS
About 1 in every 3 people in the United States will have shingles (or herpes zoster) in their lifetime.
Shingles can sometimes lead to serious complications like long-term nerve pain and vision loss.
The best way to protect yourself from shingles is vaccination.

What it is
Shingles is a painful rash illness. People get shingles when the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox, reactivates in their bodies after they have already had chickenpox.
An estimated 1 million people get shingles each year in this country. Most people who develop shingles only have it one time during their life. However, you can have shingles more than once.
Signs and symptoms
People with shingles most commonly have a rash around the left or right side of the body. The rash is usually painful, itchy, or tingly.
Shingles can lead to serious complications. The most common shingles complication is long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN.

Shingles Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
You are at risk for shingles if:
You have had chickenpox.
More than 99% of Americans born before 1980 had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it. Children can have shingles, but it is not common.
Your risk of shingles and serious complications increases:
As you get older.
If you have medical conditions that keep your immune systems from working properly such as certain cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, and HIV infection.
If you take drugs that keep your immune system from working properly, like steroids and drugs given after an organ transplant.
Causes and spread
If you are near someone with shingles:
You cannot get shingles from someone who has shingles.
You can get chickenpox from someone who has shingles if you never had chickenpox or never got chickenpox vaccine. You could then develop shingles later in life.
Shingles is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus stays in their body. The virus can reactivate later in life and cause shingles.
People who never had chickenpox or didn't get chickenpox vaccine can get infected with VZV from someone who has shingles. These people can get the virus through:
Direct contact with the fluid from shingles rash blisters.
Breathing in virus particles that come from the blisters.
People with chickenpox are more likely to spread VZV than people with shingles.

About Chickenpox
Prevention
Protect yourself with the vaccine. CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy.

Shingles Vaccine Recommendations
The best way to prevent shingles is by getting 2 doses of the vaccine.
If you have shingles, protect others
Covering the shingles rash can lower the risk of spreading the shingles virus to others. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before the blisters appear or after the rash scabs over.
To prevent spreading the virus to others:
Cover the rash
Avoid touching or scratching the rash
Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds
Avoid contact with the following people until your rash scabs over
Pregnant women who never had chickenpox or chickenpox vaccine
Premature or low birth weight infants
People with weakened immune systems
Treatment and recovery
Several antiviral medicines are available to treat shingles:
Acyclovir (ay-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Valacyclovir (va-luh-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Famciclovir (fam-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
These medicines shorten the length and severity of the illness. They work best when you take them as soon as the rash appears. If you think you have shingles, contact your doctor as soon as possible to talk about treatment.
Pain relief medicine may help with the pain caused by shingles. This can be over the counter or a prescription from your doctor. Wet compresses, calamine lotion, and warm oatmeal baths may help relieve itching.
