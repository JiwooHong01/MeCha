Antibiotic Prescribing and Use
Be Antibiotics Aware Partner Toolkit
WHAT TO KNOW
CDC's educational effort, Be Antibiotics Aware, aims to improve antibiotic prescribing and use among target consumer and healthcare professional audiences to protect patient safety and combat antimicrobial resistance.
U.S. Antibiotic Awareness Week (USAAW) is an annual observance that raises awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and the importance of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal use.
Be Antibiotics Aware complements USAAW by providing partners with key messages, sample social media posts, and graphics and videos they can use to spread the word within their organization.
Overview
USAAW 2024: Fighting Antimicrobial Resistance Takes All of Us
USAAW is an annual observance that raises awareness of the threat of AR and its impact on human health. This year, CDC is focusing on how fighting antimicrobial resistance takes all of us by sharing calls to action for diverse audiences.
Antibiotics can save lives and are critical tools for treating common and serious infections, including those that can lead to sepsis.
Any time antibiotics or antifungals are used, they can cause side effects and contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance, one of the most urgent threats to the public's health.
Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs, like bacteria and fungi, develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur in the United States each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. Many more die from complications from antimicrobial-resistant infections.
Improving how healthcare professionals prescribe and how patients take antibiotics can help keep patients healthy from adverse events, combat antimicrobial resistance, and help ensure these life-saving drugs will be available for future generations.
Each year during USAAW, CDC works collaboratively with federal, domestic, and international partners to raise awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and highlight the critical importance of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal use. Check out CDC's U.S. Antibiotic Awareness Week webpage to help spread the word.
The observance is an international collaboration, coinciding with:
European Antibiotic Awareness Day
Australia's Antimicrobial Awareness Week
Canada's Antimicrobial Awareness Week
World AMR Awareness Week

Outdoor Workers
Sun Exposure at Work
KEY POINTS
Working outdoors in sunlight can increase the risk of sunburn and skin cancer.
Employers and workers can take steps to protect against sun exposure.
Overview
Working outdoors in the sunlight can increase your risk of sunburn and skin cancer.
Ultraviolet (UV) rays are a part of sunlight that is an invisible form of radiation. UV rays can penetrate and change the structure of skin cells. There are three types of UV rays: ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC). UVA is the most abundant source of solar radiation at the earth's surface. UVA penetrates beyond the top layer of human skin. Scientists believe that UVA radiation can cause damage to connective tissue and increase a person's risk for developing skin cancer. UVB rays penetrate less deeply into skin but can still cause some forms of skin cancer. Natural UVC rays do not pose a risk to workers because they are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.
Sunlight exposure is highest during the summer and between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Working outdoors during these times increases the chances of getting sunburned.
Snow and light-colored sand reflect UV light and increase the risk of sunburn. At work sites with these conditions, UV rays may reach workers' exposed skin from both above and below.
Workers are at risk of UV radiation even on cloudy days.
Many drugs increase sensitivity to sunlight and the risk of getting sunburn, including
Thiazides
Diuretics
Tetracycline
Doxycycline
Sulfa antibiotics
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen
Reducing risk
Employers
Employers can protect workers from sun exposure by:
Scheduling outdoor work when there is less sunlight exposure.
Providing shaded or indoor break areas.
Training workers about sun exposure including:
Their risk of exposure
How to prevent exposure
The signs and symptoms of overexposure
Workers
Workers can protect themselves from UV damage from sun exposure by:
Wearing sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 15.
SPF refers to the amount of time that persons will be protected from a burn.
An SPF of 15 will allow a person to stay out in the sun 15 times longer than they normally would be able to stay without burning.
Sunscreen performance is affected by wind, humidity, perspiration, and proper application.
Throwing away old sunscreens because they do not work as well after 1-2 years.
Applying at least 1 ounce of sunscreen 20 minutes before sun exposure.
Special attention should be given to covering the ears, scalp, lips, neck, tops of feet, and backs of hands.
Reapplying sunscreens at least every 2 hours and each time you get out of the water or sweat heavily.
You may need to apply sunscreen more frequently when also using insect repellents.
Wearing appropriate clothing.
Dark clothing with a tight weave is more protective than light-colored, loosely woven clothing.
High-SPF clothing can provide more protection.
Wearing wide-brimmed hats and sunglasses with almost 100% UV protection and with side panels to protect your eyes.
Treating a sunburn
Sunburn is a sign of skin damage from spending too much time outdoors without wearing sunscreen. Years of overexposure to the sun leads to premature wrinkling, age spots, and an increased risk of skin cancer.
Eyes can also get burned from sun exposure. Sunburned eyes become red, dry, and painful, and feel gritty. Chronic exposure of eyes to sunlight may cause:
Pterygium (tissue growth that leads to blindness)
Cataracts
Macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness
Sunburns usually appear about 4 hours after sun exposure, worsen in 24-36 hours, and resolve in 3-5 days.
A worker with a sunburn may experience:
Red, warm, and tender skin
Swollen skin
Blistering
Headache
Fever
Nausea
Fatigue
There is no quick cure for minor sunburn. Workers with sunburns should avoid further exposure to the sun until the burn has resolved.
If you have a sunburn, you can:
Take a pain reliever to help with pain, headaches, and fever.
Drink plenty of water to replace fluid losses.
Take cool baths or apply cool wet cloths on the burned area.
Apply a topical moisturizing cream, aloe, or 1% hydrocortisone cream.
If blistering occurs, lightly bandage or cover the area with cause to prevent infection. Broken blisters slow the healing process and increase the risk of infection.
When the blisters break and the skin peels, dried fragments may be removed. Apply an antiseptic ointment or hydrocortisone cream.
Seek medical attention if:
Severe sunburns cover more than 15% of your body.
You are dehydrated.
You have a high fever (over 101°F).
Extreme pain lasts longer than 48 hours.

Alcohol Use
About Underage Drinking
KEY POINTS
Alcohol is the most common drug used by people younger than 21 in the United States.
Young people who drink alcohol are more likely to develop certain physical and mental health conditions.
Facts
About 4,000 young people (under 21) die from excessive alcohol use each year.A1
These deaths, which could have been prevented, take the lives of young people too soon.
Underage drinking cost the United States $24 billion in 2010 (the most recent year of data available).B2
Effects of underage drinking
Alcohol is the most common drug that young people use in the United States.3
Young people who drink alcohol are more likely to engage in risky behaviors that can lead to injuries and other health conditions. They're also more likely to experience social, academic, and legal issues.
Social, academic, and legal issues:
More school absences.
Lower grades.
Drinking and driving, which puts the safety of those who drink—as well as those around them—at risk.
Misusing prescription drugs or using illicit drugs—there can be serious health effects when using these drugs with alcohol.
Physical and mental conditions:
Violence, including homicide, suicide, and sexual violence.
Injuries including alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes, burns, falls, or drowning.
Not growing as expected.
Slower brain development—which may cause problems with memory.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and unplanned pregnancy—which can result from sex without protection.
Protection includes using condoms or taking medicine to prevent STIs, HIV, or pregnancy.
Lastly, people who start drinking earlier in life have a higher risk of using alcohol excessively or developing alcohol use disorder later in life.
What the data show
Adult alcohol use can increase underage drinking
Adolescents tend to drink if the adults around them drink or binge drink alcohol.
For example, a study showed that adolescents whose parents drank 5 or more days in a month were significantly more likely to drink alcohol than adolescents whose parents didn't drink.4
Adolescents are more likely to drink alcohol if their parents binge drink.

Also, 9% of high school students reported binge drinking during the past month.3
In recent years:
Alcohol use and binge drinking among high school students have generally decreased in recent decades.5
More high school girls drink alcohol and binge drink, compared to high school boys.5
This is a shift from previous years when boys drank more than girls.5
Some young people also report drinking and driving
About 16% of high school students reported riding in the past month with a driver who had been drinking alcohol.3
About 5% of high school students who had driven in the past month said they drove after drinking alcohol.3

Brucellosis
About Brucellosis
KEY POINTS
Brucellosis is a disease caused by bacteria.
The disease spreads to people through contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.
People in certain jobs or settings that work with animals or animal products may face increased exposure to the bacteria that cause brucellosis.
Brucellosis can be treated with antibiotics.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a family of bacteria called Brucella.
You can get the disease when you come in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that most commonly get brucellosis include cats, dogs, sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hogs, among others. People can get brucellosis by:
Eating undercooked meat such as sheep, cow, goat, or camel.
Eating undercooked game meat such as bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hog.
Consuming unpasteurized (raw) milk or other dairy products made from contaminated milk.
Breathing in the bacteria that cause brucellosis.
Getting body fluids from infected animals in the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Preparing meat or hides after hunting.
Getting certain animal vaccines in the eyes, nose or mouth or accidentally injecting yourself when vaccinating animals
Working in a lab with brucellosis samples.
People with certain jobs or hobbies may face increased exposure to the bacteria that cause brucellosis, including:
Slaughterhouse workers
Hunters
Veterinarians and veterinary staff
Animal breeders or animal shelter staff
Laboratory workers
It is extremely rare for brucellosis to spread between people.
Signs and symptoms
Doctors examining a patient
If you think you've been exposed to brucellosis, contact your health care provider.
Brucellosis can cause a range of signs and symptoms in people, and some can occur for a long time before it's diagnosed. The first symptoms can include:
Fever
Sweating
Generally feeling badly (malaise)
Not wanting to eat (anorexia)
Headache
Pain in muscles, joint, and/or back
Feeling more tired than usual (fatigue)
Other symptoms may continue or may come and go until you've had treatment, including:
Fevers that keep coming back
Arthritis
Swelling of the testicles and scrotum area
Infection of the heart (endocarditis)
Memory loss, confusion, and irritability
Depression
Swelling of the liver and/or spleen
Prevention
Eating or drinking infected animal products
The best way to prevent brucellosis infection is to be sure you don't eat or drink:
Undercooked meat
Unpasteurized (raw) dairy products, including milk, cheese, and ice cream
Pasteurization is the heating process used to destroy harmful bacteria that may make milk and milk products unsafe to eat or drink.
If you are not sure whether a dairy product is pasteurized, don't eat or drink it.
Hunters and those who work with animals
People who work with animal tissues and body fluids, including animal caretakers (veterinarians, vet techs, shelter staff, etc.), hunters, butchers, and animal herdsman, are at higher risk of brucellosis infection. If you work with animal tissues, protect yourself by wearing:
Rubber gloves
Goggles
Gowns or aprons
Masks or respirators
View Larger
Protect yourself while working with animal tissues
If the animal is infected, this protective clothing will help keep the bacteria that causes brucellosis from getting into your eyes or inside a cut or wound on your skin.
Laboratory personnel
Brucellosis is the most commonly reported laboratory-associated bacterial infection. If you work in a lab, take precautions when handling samples to prevent infection. If you are exposed, determine your risk and follow recommendations for symptom monitoring and possible post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment.
Treatment and recovery
Once your healthcare provider has confirmed that you have brucellosis from test results, you can begin treatment with antibiotics.
Your doctor will decide which antibiotics you'll get for a minimum of 6-8 weeks. To be sure you get the right medicines for you, let your healthcare providers know if you are:
Pregnant
Allergic to doxycycline or rifampin
Are immunosuppressed from medical conditions or other medicines
Brucella RB51 treatment
If you have with an infection from a strain of Brucella called RB51 from consuming infected animal products, you'll need antibiotics other than rifampin. This particular strain of Brucella is resistant to it, meaning rifampin will not treat the infection.
It's important that you take all your medicines when being treated for brucellosis. If you're not properly treated, the infection can become chronic and lead to long-term disease associated with arthritis, endocarditis, chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver or spleen.
Depending on the timing of treatment and how sick you are, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare and only happens in less than 2% of cases.

Loud Noises Can Cause Hearing Loss
About Noise-Induced Hearing Loss
WHAT TO KNOW
Noise is all around us — at school, at home, and everywhere in between.
Noise is a significant source of hearing loss.
Prevention and early detection of hearing loss due to noise are important.
Recognize signs of hearing loss and get your hearing tested if you are at risk.
Overview
Hearing loss can occur:
in children and affect communication, language, and social skills.
in occupational settings and result in permanent injury for workers.
due to loud noise near the ear or repeated exposure to loud noise.
Exposure to loud noise can lead to noise-induced hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by participating in activities that produce harmful sound levels or by repeated exposures to loud sounds.
Some examples of noisy activities include:
Watching summer fireworks on the 4th of July
Mowing the lawn
Using power tools
Watching a sports game and cheering on your favorite team
Attending a concert
Recognize early signs of noise-induced hearing loss and take steps to protect your hearing.

Food Safety
Raw Milk
WHAT TO KNOW
Pasteurization is crucial for milk safety, killing harmful germs that can cause illness.
Consuming raw milk can lead to serious health risks, especially for certain vulnerable populations.
Choosing pasteurized milk and dairy products is the best way to safely enjoy the nutritional benefits of milk.
Overview
Raw milk and A(H5N1) virus
CDC recommends against consuming raw milk contaminated with live A(H5N1) virus as a way to develop antibodies against A(H5N1) virus to protect against future disease. Consuming raw milk could make you sick.
Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized, a process that removes disease-causing germs by heating milk to a high enough temperature for a certain length of time. It's important to understand that raw milk can be a source of foodborne illness. While good practices on farms can reduce contamination, they cannot guarantee safety from harmful germs. Pasteurized milk offers the same nutritional benefits without the risks of raw milk consumption. Since the early 1900s, pasteurization has greatly reduced milk-borne illnesses.
Risk
Drinking or eating products made from raw milk can expose people to germs such as Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Listeria, Brucella, and Salmonella.
Some groups, such as children under 5, adults over 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, are at a higher risk of serious illness from these germs.
Symptoms
Symptoms of foodborne illness from raw milk can include diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. In some cases, more severe outcomes like Guillain-Barré syndrome or hemolytic uremic syndrome can occur, potentially leading to paralysis, kidney failure, stroke, or even death.
Prevention
Choose pasteurized milk and dairy products, making sure to read labels carefully.
Refrigerate perishable foods at 40°F or colder to slow bacterial growth. Bacteria can multiply rapidly if left at room temperature or in the “Danger Zone” between 40°F and 140°F. Never leave perishable food out for more than 2 hours (or 1 hour if exposed to temperatures above 90°F, like in a hot car or at a picnic).
Throw away expired or spoiled food. When in doubt, throw it out.

Urinary Tract Infection
Urinary Tract Infection Basics
KEY POINTS
Do you have pain or burning when you urinate? You might have a urinary tract infection (UTI).
Antibiotics treat UTIs. Your healthcare provider can determine if you have a UTI and what antibiotic you need.
Overview
The urinary tract includes the bladder, urethra and kidneys (see figure). UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria, often from the skin or rectum, enter the urethra and infect the urinary tract.
A female urinary tract, including the bladder and urethra. This image shows how bacteria from the skin or rectum can travel up the urethra a...

CAUTI Basics
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of a bladder infection can include:
Pain or burning while urinating
Frequent urination
Feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder
Bloody urine
Pressure or cramping in the groin or lower abdomen
Symptoms of a kidney infection can include:
Fever
Chills
Lower back pain or pain in the side of your back
Nausea or vomiting
Younger children may not be able to tell you about UTI symptoms they are having. While fever is the most common sign of UTI in infants and toddlers, most children with fever do not have a UTI.
Risk factors
UTIs are more common in females because their urethras are shorter and closer to the rectum. This makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract.
Other risk factors:
A previous UTI.
Recent sexual activity.
Changes in the bacteria that live inside the vagina or vaginal flora. For example, menopause or the use of spermicides can cause these bacterial changes.
Pregnancy.
Age (older adults and young children are more likely to get UTIs).
Structural problems in the urinary tract, such as enlarged prostate.
Poor hygiene, for example, in children who are potty-training.
Prevention
Urinate after sexual activity.
Stay well hydrated.
Take showers instead of baths.
Minimize douching, sprays or powders in the genital area.

When to seek medical care
If you or your child have symptoms of a UTI or for any symptom that is severe or concerning.
Talk to your healthcare provider right away
If your child is younger than 3 months old and has a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider will determine if you have a UTI by:
Asking about symptoms.
Doing a physical exam.
Ordering urine tests, if needed.
Starting an antibiotic to treat a UTI, if needed.
Treatment
Taking antibiotics, prescribed by a healthcare provider, at home can treat most UTIs. Your healthcare provider might also recommend medicine to help lessen the pain or discomfort. Some cases may require treatment in a hospital.
Any time you take antibiotics, they can cause side effects.
Side effects can include rash, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea and yeast infections.
More serious side effects can include antimicrobial-resistant infections or C. diff infection, which causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.
Call your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects while taking your antibiotic.
How to feel better
Drink plenty of water or other fluids.
If your healthcare provider prescribes you antibiotics:
Take antibiotics exactly as your healthcare provider tells you.
Do not share your antibiotics with others.
Do not save antibiotics for later. Talk to your healthcare provider about safely discarding leftover antibiotics.
Talk with your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your antibiotics.
