Falls in the Workplace
About Falls in the Workplace
KEY POINTS KEY POINTS
Falls can happen at any workplace.
Fall injuries are preventable.
NIOSH conducts research to prevent work-related injuries and deaths from falls across all industries.
Why it's important
Fall injuries are a common workplace injury.
The construction industry experiences the highest frequency of fall-related deaths. These deaths are mostly falls from heights.
The highest counts of nonfatal fall injuries are in the educational and health services and the healthcare and social assistance industries. These injuries are mostly slips and falls on the same level.
Other industries at high risk of fall injuries include:
Nursing and residential care
Ambulance services
Building cleaning and maintenance
Transportation and material moving
Fact
In 2020, 805 workers died from falls.1 211,640 suffered severe injuries requiring days away from work in the private industry.2
Impacts
Fall injuries create a considerable financial burden. In the United States, workers' compensation and medical expenses associated with workplace falls are estimated to cost $70 billion annually.3
Other countries face similar challenges in the workplace. In fact, the international public health community has a strong interest in developing strategies to reduce fall injuries.
National campaign to prevent falls
Falls are the number one cause of construction worker fatalities. The goal of the national campaign is to prevent fatal falls. Each year as part of the campaign, there is a National Stand-Down focusing on fall prevention.
Safety risks
Falls in the workplace frequently involve:
Unprotected edges
Unsafely positioned ladders
Misused fall protection
Water, grease, and other contaminants on the floor
Clutter and tripping hazards in walkways
Irregularities in the floor and wall openings
Prevention
Federal regulations and industry consensus standards provide specific measures and performance-based recommendations for fall prevention and protection. However, persistent unsafe practices and low safety culture across many industries define steady fall injury rates each year.
Reducing fall injury and death rates require:
Implementing new effective fall prevention and protection technologies
Using appropriate PPE like harnesses, fall guards, and slip-resistant footwear4
Improving the work safety culture by educating the workforce
These efforts require continued collaboration from:
Regulators
Industry leaders
Professional associations
Labor unions
Employers and employees
Safety professionals
Researchers
Traumatic occupational injury research labs
NIOSH conducts research to prevent work-related injuries and deaths from falls across all industries. Review our Traumatic Occupational Injury Research Labs brochure for an overview of DSR labs.
What CDC is doing
As a leader in occupational safety research, NIOSH plays a key role in these complex fall-injury prevention efforts. NIOSH bases fall-injury prevention research strategic planning and goal setting on:
The magnitude or emergence of the problem as shown by data
Immediacy of need
Resources and expertise available to work on the problem
Current research
Strength of partnerships
Status and momentum on research-to-practice efforts
Input from the National Academy of Sciences program review enhances the strategic planning process.

Older Adult Fall Prevention
About Older Adult Fall Prevention
KEY POINTS
Falls can be prevented.
Falls among adults 65 and older caused over 38,000 deaths in 2021, making it the leading cause of injury death for that group.1
In 2021, emergency departments recorded nearly 3 million visits for older adult falls.1
Falls can be prevented
Falls are a threat to the health of older adults and can reduce their ability to remain independent. However, falls don't have to be inevitable as you age. You can reduce your chance of falling or help a loved one prevent falls. There are proven ways to reduce and prevent falls, even for older adults. We identify older adults as anyone 65 years and older. CDC uses data and research to help prevent falls and save lives.

Heart Disease, Family Health History, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia
About Familial Hypercholesterolemia
KEY POINTS
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
People with FH are more likely to have coronary artery disease or a heart attack.
Finding and treating FH early, with medicines such as statins, is important to prevent coronary artery disease.
What it is
View LargerDownload
If FH is left untreated, heart attacks happen in 30% of women with FH by age 60 and 50% of men with FH by age 50.
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder that affects about 1 in 250 people and increases the likelihood of having coronary artery disease at a younger age. People with FH have increased blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, sometimes called ""bad cholesterol."" Having too much LDL cholesterol in your blood increases your risk for developing coronary artery disease or having a heart attack. For people with FH, exercising and healthy eating habits are important, but often not enough to lower their cholesterol to a healthy level. Medicines, such as statins, are needed to help control cholesterol levels. If you have FH, finding the disorder early and treating it can reduce your risk of coronary artery disease by about 80%. If your child is diagnosed with FH, statin therapy in childhood may be required, often starting by age 8-10.
Signs and symptoms
View LargerDownload
There are a number of ways to know whether you have FH.
One of the main signs of FH is LDL cholesterol levels over 190 mg/dL in adults (and over 160 mg/dL in children). In addition, most people with FH have a family health history of early coronary artery disease or heart attacks. In some cases, elevated LDL levels are found through routine blood cholesterol screening. If you have a family health history of heart disease or FH and have not had your cholesterol screened, your healthcare provider may order lipid screening, which measures the amount of cholesterol and lipids (fats) in your blood.
Your healthcare provider may be able to detect physical signs of FH during a clinical exam, although not everyone with FH has these signs. These physical signs of FH occur when extra cholesterol builds up in different parts of the body:
Bumps or lumps around your knees, knuckles, or elbows
Swollen or painful Achilles tendon (the tendon at the back of your lower leg)
Yellowish areas around your eyes
A whitish gray color in the shape of a half-moon on the outside of your cornea (the clear outer layer at the front of your eye)
If your healthcare provider suspects you have FH, he or she may refer you for genetic counseling and testing for FH.
Causes
FH is mainly caused by inherited genetic changes (mutations) in the LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 genes, which affect how your body regulates and removes cholesterol from your blood. About 60-80% of people with FH have a genetic change found in one of these genes. Genetic testing is available to check for these and other rarer genetic changes. However, there are likely more genes involved in FH that remain unknown.
You have two copies of each of the genes involved in FH, one from your mother and one from your father. A genetic change in only one copy of the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 genes is enough to cause FH. If either your mother or father has a genetic change in one of these genes that causes FH, they have a 50% chance of passing it on to you.
Most people with FH only have one FH-causing genetic change. In very rare cases, a person can have two FH-causing changes in both copies of the same gene, which results in a much more serious, rare form of FH called homozygous FH. There are two forms of homozygous FH:
Having two FH-causing changes in both copies of the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 gene
Having two FH-causing changes in both copies of the LDLRAP1 gene (People with genetic changes in only one copy of the LDLRAP1 gene do not have FH.)
People with homozygous FH have extremely high levels of cholesterol and can have heart attacks in childhood. People with homozygous FH need to find a healthcare provider knowledgeable about FH and start treatment right away.
Next steps
If you are concerned that you could have familial hypercholesterolemia or hereditary heart disease, the first step is to collect your family health history of heart disease and share this information with your healthcare provider.
Scientific Integrity at CDC
Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality
AT A GLANCE
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protects privacy and confidentiality in accordance with federal laws.
CDC uses Certificates of Confidentiality and other resources to protect identifiable and potentially identifiable information.
Overview
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commits to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information we have, in accordance with federal laws. The Privacy and Confidentiality Unit (PCU) provides guidance on privacy and confidentiality for all federally funded and supported activities through consultation and issuance of Assurances of Confidentiality to CDC programs.
Privacy
CDC provides technical support and education to CDC employees; grantees; partners; and state, Tribal, and local health departments on:
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
Other federal privacy laws.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
The HIPAA Privacy Rule
(45 CFR Parts 160
and 164
) regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, called protected health information (PHI), by covered entities. The Privacy Rule protects all PHI transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g. electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity or its business associates. It excludes certain educational and employment records.
The Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights in respect to their health information including, but not limited to, the right to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of their privacy rights and how their PHI will be used and disclosed.
The Privacy Rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without the written authorization from the individual; however, there are several exceptions to this requirement including disclosures
for public health activities.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g
; 34 CFR Part 99
) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Health care information is generally part of the education record. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
FERPA gives parents certain rights regarding their child's education record. These rights include the right to inspect and request corrections to the record. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.
FERPA generally prohibits the disclosure of any personally identifiable information contained in an education record without the appropriate written consent. FERPA offers limited exceptions to this requirement.
Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality (CoCs) protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable and potentially identifiable research information, with limited exceptions.
Any investigator or institution issued a CoC shall not:
Disclose or provide covered information, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding.
Disclose or provide covered information to any other person not connected with the research.
CDC investigators with a CoC may ONLY disclose identifiable and potentially identifiable information in the following circumstances:
If required by other federal, state, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases.
If the subject consents.
For the purposes of scientific research that is compliant with human subjects' regulations.
CoCs cover any CDC-funded research project collecting or using identifiable and potentially identifiable information, in compliance with Section 301(d)
of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). All CDC-funded research activities are automatically issued a CoC through their award. No physical certificate will be issued. The CoC will apply as a term and condition of award. This applies to:
Grants.
Cooperative Agreements.
Contracts.
CDC-sponsored intramural research.
For research activities enrolling human participants, CDC requires investigators to inform participants of the CoC protections and the limits to those protections.
Assurance of Confidentiality
An Assurance of Confidentiality (AoC) is a formal confidentiality protection authorized under Section 308(d)
of the PHSA. CDC investigators use it to collect or maintain sensitive identifiable information from individuals and institutions. The law states that no identifiable information may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied. The exception is if such institution or individual consented to that disclosure. Protected information includes identifiable information on institutions or individuals who are the subjects of non-research, public health activities with an approved AoC.
CDC implements agency AoC protection for public health activities conducted by CDC investigators that involve the collection or maintenance of identifiable information. This protection allows CDC programs to assure individuals and institutions involved in non-research activities (e.g., surveillance) that those conducting the activity will protect the confidentiality of the identifiable data collected.
Disclosures can be made without individual authorization only for purposes stated at the time of data collection or specifically consented to thereafter by each of the parties provided the promise of confidentiality.

Farm Animals
WHAT TO KNOW
Farm animals can sometimes carry germs that can cause a variety of illnesses in people.
Wash your hands after touching or being around farm animals to prevent the spread of disease.
Wear dedicated shoes when around animals and keep them outside your home.
Keep farm animals healthy to prevent the spread of disease.
Overview
Interacting with farm animals or livestock can provide education, entertainment, and in many cases a livelihood. Common farm animals may include cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, llamas, and alpacas.
Many people will only see farm animals at petting zoos or on farm visits. For others, work with farm animals is a career, lifestyle, or tradition.
Some types of farm animals are increasingly being treated like pets or used in settings outside the farm. For example, pigs and goats may be used in activities like yoga. However, it's important to remember that these animals are livestock. They are not meant to live inside the home or be kept indoors. This increases the risk of illness in people.
Recent outbreaks

How to stay healthy around farm animals
Even healthy animals can carry diseases.
Wash your hands
Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available.
Wash your hands with soap and running water after:
Contact with animal body fluids like saliva, birthing tissue or fluid.
Contact with animal products like milk and eggs.
Cleaning up animal stalls or feces (poop).
Handling animal food, supplies, bowls, or equipment.
Touching items used on the farm like fences, buckets.
Adults should supervise hand washing for children under 5 years of age.
Protect yourself while caring for farm animals
Be aware that animals can still spread germs even if they look healthy and clean. Consider the following recommendations if you work with farm animals.
Wear protective equipment
Always wear protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and boots when performing activities that involve touching bodily fluids from animals. This includes cleaning animal stalls or assisting an animal in giving birth.
Cover open wounds or cuts when visiting or working around farm animals.
Use dedicated shoes and clothes
Have dedicated shoes and gloves that you only use when working with your animals. Keep and store these items outside of your home.
If you visit another farm, be sure to scrub your shoes and change your clothes. Do this before interacting with their animals and before coming back to your animals.
Wear protective equipment while cleaning animal areas.
Prevent bites and kicks
Germs can spread from bites and scratches, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious.
Be cautious when around farm animals. Always be aware of your surroundings and know where animals and escape routes are at all times. Avoid standing directly behind or approaching farm animals from the rear. This applies even when the animal stands in stocks or is restrained.
Children's safety
Supervise children around farm animals so the child does not get injured. Teach children about farm animal safety including keeping fingers away from the mouth and not approaching an animal from behind.
What to do if you are bitten, scratched, or kicked by a farm animal
Bites and scratches can become infected, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious. Being kicked by an animal can result in serious injury. If kicked by an animal, move away from the animal as quickly as possible. Seek medical attention, especially if you were kicked in the head.
To prevent infection from bites and scratches:
Wash wounds with soap and warm water immediately.
Seek medical attention if:
The wound or injury is serious.
The wound or site of injury becomes red, painful, warm, or swollen.
It has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot.
A wound or injury is considered if there is uncontrolled bleeding, inability to move, or are in extreme pain. Additionally, showing muscle or bone, or a bite is over a joint are other indicators of a serious injury.
Stay healthy at petting zoos and animal exhibits
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after touching farm animals or anything in the habitat.
Avoid touching your mouth before washing your hands.
Adults should supervise hand washing for young children.
Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available.
Wash hands after removing clothes and shoes.
Supervise children when they are around farm animals
Prevent hand-to-mouth activities, such as nail biting, finger sucking, and eating dirt. Help children wash hands well with soap after interaction with any farm animal.
Do not let children stand behind animals, grab their tails, or put their fingers near an animal's mouth. This can lead to serious injury if the animal bites, scratches, or kicks. Do not let children under 5 years old handle or touch chicks, ducklings, or live poultry.
Do not bring baby or children's items (for example, toys, pacifiers, spill-proof cups, baby bottles, strollers) into animal areas.
Do not eat food or drink beverages in animal areas or where animals are allowed to roam.

Tips for Staying Healthy at Animal Exhibits
How to keep farm animals healthy
Keeping farm animals healthy helps to prevent the spread of diseases to people.
Keep farm animals safe and clean
Keep farm animals in an appropriately sized enclosed area at night. This will decrease their exposure to wild animals that could transmit rabies or other diseases.
Use elevated feeders and store feed off the ground. This will help keep pests like mice and rats away.
Properly dispose of soiled bedding and spoiled, expired, or uneaten food so it doesn't make your animals sick.
Clean farm animal enclosures and stalls frequently. Wear protective equipment while cleaning (for example, boots, gloves, and mask).
Monitor your animals' health
Make sure your livestock stay updated on vaccinations. Talk to your veterinarian about what vaccinations they recommend for your animals. Several vaccinations are available for livestock, including for brucellosis, leptospirosis, and rabies.
Schedule routine veterinary exams to keep your farm animals healthy and to prevent infectious diseases and internal and external parasites. Make sure any other animals living on the farm receive routine veterinary care, flea and tick prevention, and vaccinations too. This includes dogs and cats.
Contact your veterinarian if you notice any signs of illness in your animals. Keep in mind that even animals that look healthy can still sometimes spread germs to people and other animals.

Agriculture Worker Safety and Health
KEY POINTS
Agricultural workers are at increased risk for on-the-job injuries and deaths.
NIOSH created an agricultural safety and health program to address the risk of injuries and illnesses experienced by agricultural workers and their families.
Quick facts and stats
Between 2021-2022, there were 21,020 injuries in agricultural production that required days away from work. There is well-known underreporting of injuries in this industry.1
Almost one-third (29%) of injuries in agricultural production that required days away from work from 2021-2022 were from falls.1
In 2014, An estimated 4,000 youth were injured while working on a farm.2
In 2022, workers in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry had one of the highest fatal injury rates (18.6 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalents), compared to 3.7 deaths per 100,000 FTE for all U.S. industries.3
Transportation incidents were the leading cause of death for these farmers and farm workers. Other leading causes were violence by other persons or animals and contact with objects and equipment.3
In 2022, over half (56%) of deaths in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting industry occurred to workers 55 years of age and older.4
Who is at increased risk
In 2023, approximately 2.3 million workers were employed in agriculture and related industries in the U.S.5
The average age of all U.S. farm producers in 2022 was 58.1 years, up 0.6 years from 2017, continuing a long-term trend of aging in the U.S. producer population.6
An estimated 893,000 youth under 20 years of age lived on farms in 2014, with just over half (51%) also performing work on the farm.
An estimated 266,000 youth were hired to work on U.S. farms in 20147.
What's being done
In 1990, NIOSH developed an agricultural safety and health program to address the high risks of fatal injuries and illnesses experienced by workers and families in agriculture.
NIOSH supports extramural research and prevention programs at 12 Centers for Agricultural Safety and Health. These programs conduct research on injuries related to agriculture as well as pesticide exposure, respiratory health, musculoskeletal disorders, underserved populations, and mental health.

PARASITES 
About Liver Flukes
KEY POINTS
Liver flukes are parasites that can infect humans and cause liver and bile duct disease.
There are two families of liver flukes that cause disease in humans: Opisthorchiidae (which includes species of Clonorchis and Opisthorchis) and Fasciolidae (which includes species of Fasciola).
These two families of liver flukes differ in their geographic distribution, life cycle, and long-term outcome after clinical infection.

Liver Flukes
Clonorchiasis (Clonorchis Infection)
Clonorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Clonorchis (also known as Chinese liver fluke disease), is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
You cannot get Clonorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Clonorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).
Fasciola (Fascioliasis Infection)
Fasciola is a liver fluke that can infect the liver and bile duct of exposed people and animals, such as sheep, cattle, goats, and other plant-eating domestic and wild animals.
Fasciola parasites can cause an infectious disease called fascioliasis. Generally, fascioliasis is more common in people who live or work around livestock (e.g., sheep, cattle, goats) in areas where animal infections are common.
Two Fasciola species can infect people:
Fasciola hepatica: the main species that infects people. Other names are ""the common liver fluke"" and ""the sheep liver fluke.""
Fasciola gigantica: a related species that primarily affects domestic and wild animals but can also infect people.
Fascioliasis occurs in all continents except Antarctica, in over 70 countries, especially where there are sheep, cattle, or goats.
In most cases, people can get Fasciola infection by eating raw watercress or other freshwater plants contaminated by larvae.
People can get infected by consuming contaminated water that they drink. People can also get infected by eating vegetables that they washed or irrigated with contaminated water.
People cannot get Fasciola from another person.
Opisthorchis (Opisthorchis Infection)
Opisthorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Opisthorchis is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
There is Opisthorchis viverrini (i.e., the Southeast Asian liver fluke) and O. felineus (i.e., the cat liver fluke).
You cannot get Opisthorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Opisthorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).

In most cases, people can get Fasciola infection by eating raw watercress or other freshwater plants contaminated by larvae.
People can get infected by consuming contaminated water that they drink. People can also get infected by eating vegetables that they washed or irrigated with contaminated water.
People cannot get Fasciola from another person.
Opisthorchis (Opisthorchis Infection)
Opisthorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Opisthorchis is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
There is Opisthorchis viverrini (i.e., the Southeast Asian liver fluke) and O. felineus (i.e., the cat liver fluke).
You cannot get Opisthorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Opisthorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).

About Fasciolopsis
KEY POINTS
Fasciolopsiasis is an infection caused by the parasite Fasciolopsis buski, an intestinal fluke.
You can get infected by eating raw or undercooked aquatic plants that have the organism encysted (enclosed by a thick membrane or shell) on them.
You can treat Fasciolopsis infection with medication.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Fasciolopsiasis is an infection caused by the parasitic fluke, Fasciolopsis buski. It is the largest intestinal fluke that humans can get. You can find Fasciolopsis in south and southeastern Asia. Both humans and pigs can become infected. Fasciolopsiasis, also called Fasciolopsis infection, is treatable with medication.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Fasciolopsis page.
Signs and symptoms
Most people with Fasciolopsis infection have no symptoms. However, abdominal pain and diarrhea can occur one or two months after infection. With heavy infections, Fasciolopsis flukes can cause
Intestinal obstruction
Abdominal pain
Nausea
Vomiting
Fever
Allergic reactions and swelling of the face and other parts of the body can also occur. Some people may experience anemia (a condition where there are not enough red blood cells in the body).
Causes
You can get Fasciolopsis infection by eating raw or undercooked aquatic plants that have the organism attached to them. You can find Fasciolopsis in south and southeastern Asia. Both people and pigs can get Fasciolopsis infection.
People and pigs pass the eggs in their feces (poop). The eggs develop in freshwater and infect snails. After further development in the snails, the parasites leave the snail and attach to freshwater plants. People become infected when they eat the contaminated water plants, such as watercress, raw (or undercooked).
Prevention
The easiest way to prevent Fasciolopsis infection is to not eat raw or undercooked freshwater plants. Otherwise, you can cook all freshwater plants well before eating them (in boiling water).
To prevent from spreading Fasciolopsis
Do not let feces from humans or pigs get into the water where freshwater plants grow.
Do not feed raw freshwater plants to pigs.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for Fasciolopsis buski eggs or the flukes with a microscope. Sometimes they are in your vomit.
Treatment and recovery
There is a safe and effective medication to treat Fasciolopsis infection. Talk to your healthcare provider about treatment.

Fatigue
About Fatigue and Work
AT A GLANCE
Fatigue can affect anyone and be related to many work-related factors.
Work-related fatigue can affect worker safety and health.
Employers and workers should work together to reduce fatigue risks and manage fatigue.
Overview
In workplace settings, fatigue is commonly associated with nonstandard schedules which disrupt or shorten sleep. Examples of nonstandard schedules include night shift work and extended work hours.
Fatigue can also be associated with other workplace factors, such as:
Stress
Physically or mentally demanding tasks
Working in hot environments
It can stem from several different factors and its effects extend beyond sleepiness.
Fatigue can:
Slow down reaction times
Reduce attention or concentration
Limit short-term memory
Impair judgment
High levels of fatigue can affect any worker in any job. It has serious consequences for worker safety and health.
To keep workers safe and healthy, employers should:
Learn the risks for fatigue-related events.
Identify the sources of fatigue.
Use strategies to prevent and manage fatigue.

Stillbirth
About Stillbirth
KEY POINTS
Stillbirth is more common than people may realize and remains a sad reality for many families.
If you’re pregnant and you experience something that seems unusual or is worrying you, talk to your healthcare provider.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
A stillbirth is when a fetus dies in the uterus after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Stillbirth is different from miscarriage. In the United States, a miscarriage is usually defined as the loss of a fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy.
Stillbirth is further classified as early, late, or term:
Early is the loss of a fetus between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy.
Late is the loss of a fetus between 28 and 36 weeks of pregnancy.
Term is the loss of a fetus at 37 or more weeks of pregnancy.
CDC works to learn why stillbirths happen and what more can be done.
Who is at risk
Stillbirth occurs in families of all races, ethnicities, and income levels, and to women of all ages. However, stillbirth occurs more commonly among certain groups of people including women who
Are 35 years of age or older
Are of low socioeconomic status
Smoke cigarettes during pregnancy
Have certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure
Are pregnant with more than one baby (such as twins or triplets)
Have had a stillbirth in the past
Stillbirths also occur more often to women in certain racial or ethnic groups. In 2020, stillbirth occurred among non-Hispanic Black women two times more often than among non-Hispanic White and Asian or Pacific Islander women.12
Health disparities in stillbirth are not rooted in biological or genetic differences between races and ethnicities. These disparities can be attributed to many underlying causes, including access to quality health care, pre-existing health conditions, and structural discrimination. Investigating these disparities is an important part of creating programs to reduce them.
Adrian's story
My son Adrian was stillborn due to complications from undiagnosed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition that can happen after 20 weeks of pregnancy. No one mentioned the risk of stillbirth, and none of my providers seemed concerned about my symptoms. The night before I hit my 41st week of pregnancy, I went to bed with my son actively kicking in my belly. By the time I woke up the following morning, he was dead. I wish I had known stillbirth is as common as it is. I wish I had known that having symptoms of preeclampsia was a big deal. Most of all, I wish more people talked about stillbirth. My son should be here, and he isn't.
What CDC is doing
CDC works to learn more about who had a stillbirth and explores whether we know why. CDC does this by tracking how often stillbirth occurs and researching what causes stillbirth. Knowledge about the potential causes of stillbirth can be used to develop recommendations, policies, and services to help prevent stillbirth. While we continue to learn more about stillbirth, much work remains.
Arthritis
Fibromyalgia
KEY POINTS
Fibromyalgia is a type of arthritis that causes pain, fatigue, emotional and mental distress, and sleep problems.
There is no cure, but you can manage it with self-care, therapies, and medicines.
Overview
Fibromyalgia is a type of arthritis that causes pain and disability, reducing a person's quality of life. It can cause chronic (long-term) pain:
All over the body.
On one side of the body.
Above or below the waist.
Millions of people have fibromyalgia in the United States.
Fibromyalgia affects people of all ages, including children.
It's most common in adults.
Experiencing Pain Differently
People with fibromyalgia may be more sensitive to pain than those who don't have it. This is known as ""abnormal pain perception processing.""
Fibromyalgia can lead to other health problems
People with fibromyalgia are more likely to:
End up in the hospital.
Experience a lower quality of life.
Have major depressive disorders.
Have other types of arthritis, like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.

Parvovirus B19 and Fifth Disease
About Parvovirus B19
AT A GLANCE
Parvovirus B19 infection is usually mild in people who are otherwise healthy.
Common symptoms include ""slapped cheek"" rash in children, and joint pains in adults.
Complications can occur among people with underlying blood disorders or weakened immune system.
Infection early during pregnancy can cause a slight increase in the risk of a miscarriage.
Overview
Parvovirus B19 infection usually causes no symptoms or mild illness, such as flu-like symptoms, rashes and joint pains. In individuals with blood disorders or a weakened immune system, infection can cause a low blood count. Infection during pregnancy can sometimes lead to additional complications.
Symptoms
Some people who get infected with this virus will have no symptoms.
When symptoms of parvovirus B19 infection occur, they are usually mild and may include the following:
Fever
Headache
Cough
Sore throat
Rashes
Joint pain
Rashes
The clinical presentation most often associated with parvovirus B19 infection is a red rash on the face, also called a ""slapped cheek"" rash. This is also known as Fifth Disease (or Erythema Infectiosum). This rash typically appears a few days after the fever or flu-like symptoms. It is more common in children than adults.
Parvovirus B19 infection can also cause a general rash on the chest, back, buttocks, or arms and legs. The rash may be itchy. It usually goes away in 7 to 10 days but can come and go for several weeks. As it starts to go away, it may look lacy.
Joint Pain
Infection with parvovirus B19 can lead to pain and swelling in the joints, called polyarthopathy syndrome. This is more common in adults than children and is most common in women.
Adults may experience joint pain without other symptoms. Joints are affected on both sides, usually in the hands, feet and knees. The joint pain usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks but can last for months or longer. It usually goes away without any long-term problems.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Parvovirus B19
Complications
Parvovirus B19 infection is usually mild for children and adults who are otherwise healthy. However, for some people, it can cause serious health complications affecting the nerves, joints, or blood system.
Parvovirus B19 has been shown to cause a severe drop in blood count (anemia) in some patients with certain blood disorders or with a weakened immune system.
You may be at increased risk for complications from a parvovirus B19 infection if you have one or more of these health conditions:
Leukemia or other cancers
Organ transplant
HIV infection
Blood disorders such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia
Parvovirus B19 in pregnancy
If you get a parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy, the virus could spread to the baby. This is not common but could cause a miscarriage. See 'Parvovirus B19 in Pregnancy' for further information.
Keep Reading:
Parvovirus B19 in Pregnancy
Recent data on parvovirus B19 activity in the U.S.
Parvovirus B19 has become more prevalent this year with an increased number of cases in 2024, compared to previous years. Recent MMWR articles demonstrate how certain groups at increased risk from infection have been affected by severe health outcomes.
Notes from the Field: Human Parvovirus B19 Infections Among Pregnant Persons — Minnesota, January–September 2024
Diagnosis
In special circumstances, your healthcare provider may test your blood for parvovirus antibodies. The test will determine if you are susceptible or possibly immune to parvovirus B19 infection or if you were recently infected.
Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about whether you should get tested.
Treatment
Parvovirus B19 infections are usually mild and will go away on their own. Children and adults who are otherwise healthy usually recover completely.
Treatment usually involves relieving symptoms, such as fever, itching, and joint pain and swelling. For persons who develop a low blood count, treatment may include supportive care, blood products, and other specialized therapies.
See your healthcare provider if:
You have complications from a parvovirus B19 infection, or
You are infected while pregnant.

Filarial Worms
PARASITES 
About Filarial Worms
KEY POINTS
Filarial worms are a type of microscopic parasitic worm.
They mainly spread through insect bites.
Symptoms from filarial worm infections can be minor (e.g., itching or swelling) but may be severe (e.g., blindness).
There are antiparasitic drugs that can treat filarial worm infections.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Filarial worms are a family of parasites that are found in tropical regions. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Once they infect a person, they can cause diseases that attack different parts of the body.
Symptoms
Symptoms of filarial worm infections range from itching and swelling to disfigurement and blindness. However, many people infected with filarial worms will have no symptoms.
Diseases and common symptoms caused by filarial worms include
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, can cause itchy skin and skin changes and damage the eyes and may lead to blindness.
Lymphatic filariasis, sometimes called elephantiasis, can cause severe swelling of body parts, particularly legs, arms, genital area, and other parts of the body.
Loiasis, also known as Loa loa or African eye worm, can cause itchy, non-painful swellings on limbs or worms that move across the eye.
Mansonellosis, which can cause fever, fatigue, and joint and abdominal (belly) pain.
Causes and spread
Filarial worm diseases affect millions of people a year in Africa, South America, the Pacific islands, and Asia. They spread mostly through the bites of insects like blackflies, mosquitoes, or midges.
Tiny immature worms, known as larvae, will enter a human body when the insect bites into the skin. Once inside a person, they spread throughout the body, grow, and reproduce. When an insect bites an infected person, the insect can ingest the new larvae and eventually infect another person.
Prevention
In most cases, the best way to prevent most filarial worm infections is to avoid insect bites. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using insect repellent on exposed skin, and sleeping under mosquito nets will help prevent insects from biting you.
Treatment
Medications known as antiparasitic drugs can treat new filarial worm infections. In people with advanced disease-causing chronic swelling, surgery or lymphedema care may be needed.
Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are currently the target of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. These campaigns deliver safe and inexpensive drugs aimed at reducing or eliminating transmission of these infections. For some, filaria MDA will reduce symptoms as well. For others, other treatments are needed for symptoms.
Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs)
About Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers
AT A GLANCE
Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of diseases that are caused by several distinct families of viruses.
The term ""viral hemorrhagic fever"" refers to a condition where many of the body's organ systems are affected, the overall cardiovascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to function on its own is reduced.
In addition to VHFs, there are serious infectious diseases like Nipah and Hendra diseases that also require a specialized laboratory, are highly pathogenic, and have no, or limited, vaccine or treatment currently available.
VHFs, Nipah and Hendra disease can cause relatively mild illness or more life-threatening disease. Symptoms can vary but may include bleeding or hemorrhaging. Distribution of these viruses is determined by where the animals that naturally carry them live.

Types
Most VHFs fall into one of four families of virus:
Arenaviruses
Each arenavirus has one or a few closely related rodents that carry the virus without getting sick themselves. This is known as the reservoir, or source of the virus in nature. The reservoir can spread the virus to people through infected urine, saliva, or droppings, and can cause severe disease in people.
People are infected with arenaviruses by:
Touching with rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials from an infected rodent
Breathing in air contaminated by rodent urine, droppings or nesting materials.
Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent.
Eating food contaminated by urine, droppings, or saliva from an infected rodent.
Contact with another person who has certain arenaviruses, such as Chapare, Lassa, Machupo, and Lujo viruses.
Bunyavirales order
Viruses in the Bunyavirales order are spread by rodents or insects, such as mosquitos, ticks, or sand flies. They can produce mild to severe disease in animals and people. Many of these viruses cannot spread between people. However, person-to-person spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has occurred in healthcare settings where infection control was limited.
Filoviruses
Filoviruses can cause severe illness in people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and gorillas). The Egyptian rousette bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is a cave-dwelling bat, and the reservoir for Marburg virus. Bats infected with orthomarburgviruses do not show obvious signs of illness. It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that bats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they can spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Caretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection.
Flaviviruses
Flaviviruses, are found throughout the world. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to severe disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large economic and social impact on people living in affected areas.
Paramyxoviruses
Paramyxoviruses can cause sudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within the Paramyxoviridae family, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because they require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.

Paramyxoviruses Hendra virus 9-16 days Australia Flying fox bat (genus Pteropus)
Paramyxoviruses Nipah virus 5-14 days Bangladesh, India Flying fox bat (genus Pteropus)
Prevention
Prevention of VHFs and other HCIDs depends on the host reservoir and how the virus spreads. Prevention measures can target reservoir exclusion activities (for example, use of insect repellents, bed nets, and protective clothing and disinfection procedures while caring for a sick person) or by sealing up and setting traps in homes and other buildings when a rodent infestation is discovered.

Firearm Injury and Death Prevention
CDC's website is being modified to comply with President Trump's Executive Orders.
Preventing Firearm Injury and Death
KEY POINTS
Firearm injuries and suicides are preventable—not inevitable—and everyone has a role to play in prevention.
A comprehensive approach to prevention makes communities healthier and safer.
Resources are available to help firearm owners consider the best options for securely storing firearms.
How can firearm violence and suicide be prevented?
This page lists some examples of proven prevention activities communities have adopted.
Address the needs of people at greatest risk for experiencing firearm injury and deaths.
For example, street outreach programs connect populations at highest risk for violence with community services and help to reduce conflicts in the community. They have shown promising results for multiple outcomes. Gatekeeper programs train community members to identify people who may be at risk for suicide and to respond effectively with referrals to treatment or other support services, as appropriate.
When people are injured from violence or experience suicidal ideation or attempts, there can be a window of opportunity to provide help. Hospital-based violence and suicide intervention programs can connect them and their families with services. Hospital-based programs have shown promise for reducing risk for future violence as well as reduced suicide and suicide attempts.
Therapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy have been shown to prevent suicide risk as well as lessen harms and future risks for people who have experienced violence.
Improve the physical conditions within communities.
Multiple cities have had success with approaches like cleaning and maintaining vacant lots. These approaches increase opportunities for positive social interactions and reduce opportunities for violence. Urban green spaces have been associated with reduced firearm assaults, reduced stress and improved mental health, with particular benefits in areas with the highest poverty.
Ensuring students have safe routes to and from school can keep kids out of harm's way. Programs that place trained community members along these routes to monitor and assist with students' safe travel have shown benefits on school attendance and reductions in overall crime, including lower rates of violent crimes.
Address circumstances that contribute to risk.
Strengthening economic and household security through approaches like housing assistance, childcare subsidies, unemployment insurance, tax credits, and livable wages can help lift families out of poverty, reduce stress, and enhance positive outcomes, which in turn can help reduce the risk for violence and suicide. An analysis of state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) laws, for example, found that higher state EITCs were associated with lower rates of violence and suicide.
Secure storage of firearms, such as in a safe or lock box, can help prevent unauthorized access and use of firearms, including by children and those at risk for harming themselves or others.
How can you securely store your firearm?
It is important to store all firearms safely when not in use. Putting a firearm out of sight or out of reach is not safe storage and not enough to prevent use by children or unauthorized adults.
Resources are available to help firearm owners consider the best options for safely storing firearms:
The National Shooting Sports Foundation's Project ChildSafe
emphasizes the importance of storing firearms unloaded and locked, with ammunition secured separately. They provide safety kits
, brochures, tip sheets, and other educational materials and resources.
Additional Safe Storage Resources

Healthy Pets, Healthy People
Fish
WHAT TO KNOW
Fish can sometimes spread harmful germs that can make people sick.
Tank water and items in tanks can be contaminated with germs.
Wash your hands after feeding fish or handling their supplies, including their tank and items in their tank.
Overview
Millions of households in the United States keep aquarium fish. Fish can make great pets for people with allergies to other pets and they've been shown help to help reduce stress.
Although fish can make entertaining and calming pets, fish owners should be aware that fish sometimes carry germs that can make people sick. Although rare, germs from fish and the water they live in can cause a variety of illnesses in people.
Diseases
Below are certain diseases that can be spread by pet fish.
Aeromoniasis
Burkholderia pseudomallei
Edwardsiellosis
Erysipelothrix
Klebsiella
Mycobacteriosis
(Fish Tank Granuloma, Swimming Pool Granuloma)
Salmonella infection
Streptococcus iniae
Vibriosis
How to stay healthy around fish
The water and items in fish tanks can be contaminated with germs.
Before buying a pet fish, make sure a fish is the right type of pet for your family. Be aware that pet fish can sometimes spread germs to people. Children younger than 5 years old, adults 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get severe illness from germs fish can carry.
Wash your hands
You don't have to touch a fish to get sick from the germs it can carry. Fish tanks, equipment, and tank water can be contaminated with germs. The best way to prevent illness from fish and their environment is to wash your hands often.
Wash your hands with soap and running water:
Before and after touching or caring for fish
After feeding your fish
After handling your fish's equipment (for example, rocks, tank decorations, tank water)
After cleaning your pet's tank
Before eating and drinking
Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available. Supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol.
Safely clean and maintain your fish tank
Wear gloves when cleaning fish tanks.
Tank water and items in your fish tank can be contaminated with germs.
Wear gloves when cleaning or caring for your aquarium, especially if you have cuts or wounds on your hands or if you plan to work with rough rocks or spiny fish.
Dump tank water and clean aquarium items in a bathtub, laundry sink, or outside instead of a kitchen sink when possible.
Clean and disinfect sinks and bathtubs after using them to dump aquarium water or clean aquarium items.
People with weakened immune systems should let others in the household care for the fish tank when possible. If this isn't possible, they should wear gloves.
Don't let children younger than 5 years old clean or handle aquarium items.
Prevent scratches and cuts
Some larger fish have sharp points in their fins that could scratch or damage your skin. Although it doesn't happen often, germs can spread from fin scratches or scrapes from the gravel or rocks in a tank, even when the wound does not seem deep or serious.
What to do if you get scratched or cut
If you get a scratch or cut while caring for pet fish:
Wash your wounds with soap and water immediately.
Seek medical attention:
If the wound becomes red, painful, warm, or swollen, or
If the wound is serious (uncontrolled bleeding, loss of function, extreme pain, or there is muscle or bone exposure).
If you seek medical attention, tell your healthcare provider you had contact with fish and aquariums.
Don't buy dangerous fish
Some fish are dangerous and even venomous and are not safe to keep. Just because you can buy a fish doesn't mean that it's safe or legal to own. Some fish have venoms they can release to protect themselves, like lionfish and some types of catfish. Most fish do not have teeth that can cause damage to skin, but some, like piranhas, have very sharp teeth that can cause serious harm.
How to keep fish healthy
Do your research before bringing home a new pet fish.
Before bringing home a pet fish, research what types of fish and aquariums are suitable for your family. Know that some fish can require more extensive care than others, and some fish can live a very long time. Certain types of fish require more extensive care and supplies than others.
Before choosing a fish
Learn about the different types of aquariums and their maintenance needs. Work with pet store staff to decide if a fresh or saltwater tank is right for you. Saltwater tanks need more maintenance than freshwater tanks. Match the size of the tank to the space available in your home and to the amount of time you have to maintain it.
Consider purchasing a second aquarium to be used when you're cleaning your first tank, or to house new fish before you place them in your established tank. Having a second tank to temporarily house fish may help reduce their stress and disease. Once you've decided what type of aquarium you want, learn how to set it up properly.
Ask your veterinarian about the proper setup for your aquarium, the types of fish you should keep, as well as food, care, and environmental requirements for your fish.
Think about
Tank size
Gravel type
Plants
Water temperature
Lighting (UV, etc.)
Aquarium filters and pumps
Methods to treat the water (chemically, etc.)
Frequency of tank cleaning and maintenance
Equipment and accessories
Before bringing fish home, make sure your aquarium is ready. Ask your veterinarian about ""cycling a tank"" to get the bacteria and nitrogen levels balanced. Learn which fish can go in the aquarium you have. Most fish live in either saltwater or freshwater, not both.
Consider the number of fish to keep in your tank; a good standard is 1 inch of fish per gallon of water. Don't forget to research which species of fish can be in the same tank together and what types of food they will need. Some types of fish, like male betta fish, can't be in the same aquarium together because they will fight.
How to choose a pet fish
Pick fish that are active in their tanks in the pet store. Compare the fish to those of the same type around it. Is it acting like the others or is it off by itself? Is it able to swim normally?
Don't select fish from a tank that has a high number of dead fish. Healthy fish should have smooth, sleek, shiny scales that aren't discolored. Their bodies should not have any bumps, and their fins should be intact.
Bringing your new fish home
When bringing a new fish home, it's very important to acclimate it to your aquarium water. Purchased fish will often be given to you in a clear bag with water from their tank at the store. This water will be a different temperature than your aquarium water at home.
To acclimate your fish:
Place the entire bag, still intact, in your aquarium to float at the surface for about 30 minutes to an hour to acclimate the fish to the temperature of the tank.
Then, carefully open and gradually pour the bag to release the fish into your tank.
Do not remove the fish from the bag with a small net as this may injure the fish.
Try not to pour too much water from the bag into your aquarium at home because of the possible germs it may contain.
Monitor your pet's health
If a fish looks sick, separate it from other fish in the aquarium.
Check your fish daily for signs of illness. A sick fish may swim abnormally, have red, brown, or white splotches, not eat, or be swollen. If a fish in your tank looks sick, it's best to remove it and place it in a tank by itself. This will help prevent other fish in your main aquarium from getting sick.
Talk to a veterinarian experienced in fish medicine if you have questions about your pet's health.
Promptly remove any dead fish from your aquarium so disease doesn't spread to other fish.
Even though fish appear healthy, they may still spread germs to humans. If you become sick shortly after purchasing new fish or cleaning your aquarium, make sure to tell your healthcare provider that you have a pet fish.
What to do if you no longer want your pet fish
Don't release unwanted pets
Do not release your fish outdoors. Most fish released into ponds or rivers will die, and some can threaten natural wildlife populations.
Find a new home for your fish:
Consider giving your pet to another fish hobbyist.
Contact a local aquarium, school, or zoo to see if they would accept your pet.
Talk to your veterinarian. They may be able to help you find a new home for your fish.

DECEMBER 13, 2023
About Commercial Fishing Safety
KEY POINTS
Commercial fishing is one of the most hazardous occupations in the United States.
NIOSH Center for Maritime Safety and Health Studies works with industry, state, and federal partners, to conduct studies of fishing safety to reduce the incidence of injuries and fatalities among the nation’s fishermen.
Overview

Commercial fishing is one of the most hazardous occupations in the United States. The commercial fishing industry had a fatality rate over 40 times higher than the national average in 2019.1
Characteristics of fishing operations include heavy weather, long work hours, strenuous labor, and working with hazardous machinery.
NIOSH Commercial Fishing Incident Database
Since 1991, the NIOSH Western States Division (WSD) has conducted studies of fishing safety to reduce the incidence of injuries and fatalities among the nation’s fishermen. To do this, NIOSH developed the Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID) to track work-related fatalities in the commercial fishing industry.
Studies of CFID data show that hazards can differ between fisheries and regions. The greatest dangers to fishermen are vessel disasters, falls overboard, and working with machinery on deck.
Workplace hazards
The most common hazards include:
Vessel Disasters – Including sinkings, capsizings, and groundings
Falls Overboard – A crewmember falls off the vessel into water
Onboard Hazards – Including dangerous machinery, slippery surfaces, and toxic substances
Other Hazards – Including falls from docks, and diving operations
What's being done

Flavoring-related Lung Disease
About Flavoring-related Lung Disease
KEY POINTS
Flavoring-related lung disease is caused by the flavoring chemical diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) and its substitute, 2,3-pentanedione (acetyl propionyl).
Flavoring chemicals are used in food flavoring and production industries.
Workers exposed to these flavoring chemicals are at risk of severe respiratory impairment.
Overview
Diacetyl and its substitute, 2,3-pentanedione (acetyl propionyl), are flavoring chemicals used in food flavoring and production industries. These include microwave popcorn, bakery mix, and flavored coffee industries.
Workplace exposure to diacetyl has been associated with severe respiratory impairment and a lung disease called obliterative bronchiolitis. The disease is also called constrictive bronchiolitis and bronchiolitis obliterans. This serious lung disease causes scarring and constriction in the smallest airways of the lung called bronchioles, blocking air movement. Obliterative bronchiolitis cannot be cured. The chemical 2,3-pentanedione is chemically similar and has had similar respiratory effects in animal studies.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has evaluated flavoring chemicals and determined they are ""generally recognized as safe"" to eat. However, workers can be exposed to flavoring chemicals in different ways and quantities than the general consumer. They can be harmful for food and chemical industry workers who breath air contaminated with these chemicals.
Much remains unknown about flavoring-related chemicals. Identifying which specific substances contribute to flavorings-related lung disease is challenging. Flavoring mixtures are complex and health data for many chemicals are unavailable. The flavorings industry has estimated over a thousand flavoring chemicals can potentially be respiratory hazards.
Employers, safety professionals, and workers should take steps to prevent working conditions and practices that place workers at risk.
Research
NIOSH has led research on the occupational impacts of flavorings and recommendations. The first observation of obliterative bronchiolitis in a food production employee may have occurred in 1985. It was in a facility where diacetyl was listed among ingredients used in making flavorings for the baking industry.
In August 2000, a health department requested NIOSH assistance to investigate obliterative bronchiolitis in former workers of a microwave popcorn plant. This led to further NIOSH research that found artificial butter flavorings added to the popcorn caused disease. Findings from NIOSH investigations in microwave popcorn and flavorings manufacturing industries provided a basis for the 2004 NIOSH Alert: Preventing Lung Disease in Workers Who Use or Make Flavorings. A Summary Sheet is also available in Spanish.
In 2016, NIOSH published a criteria document that provides critical review of scientific and technical information on:
Prevalence or frequency of hazards
Existence of health risks
Methods to identify and control exposure
The document also provides recommended exposure limits for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione.

Typhus Fevers
Typhus Fevers Basics
AT A GLANCE
Typhus fevers are a group of diseases caused by bacteria that are spread to humans by fleas, lice, and chiggers.
Typhus fevers include murine typhus, epidemic typhus and scrub typhus.
Fleas spread murine typhus, body lice spread epidemic typhus, and chiggers spread scrub typhus.
The most common symptoms are fever, headaches, and sometimes rash.
Overview
Murine Typhus
Murine typhus, also called flea-borne typhus is a disease caused by the bacteria Rickettsia typhi. Murine typhus is spread to people through contact with infected fleas, most commonly the Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopsis) and the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis).

Fleas
About Fleas
KEY POINTS
Fleas are small insects that survive by feeding on animal or human blood.
Their bites can cause discomfort, itchiness, and irritation. Sometimes, fleas can infect people or pets with the germs that cause flea-borne typhus, plague, or cat scratch disease.
Overview
Common fleas of the United States
There are more than 2,500 flea species worldwide, with more than 300 species occurring in the United States. However, only a few species of fleas affect people’s health. These include the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis), dog flea (Ctenocephalides canis), ground squirrel flea (Oropsylla montana), and Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis).
Fleaborne diseases of the United States
In the United States, some fleas carry pathogens that can cause human disease, including:
Plague — most commonly spread to humans in the United States by infected ground squirrel fleas, or globally by infected Oriental rat fleas. Plague can also be spread by improperly handling a plague infected animal. Most U.S. cases of plague occur in rural areas of the western United States.
Murine typhus — spread to people by infected cat fleas, infected Oriental rat fleas, or their feces. Most cases in the United States are reported from California, Texas, and Hawaii.
Cat scratch disease (CSD) — spread to humans most often through the scratch of a domestic or feral cat that has been infested with Ctenocephalides felis fleas. The germ that causes the illness is shed in the flea feces and are introduced through the cat's scratch. CSD occurs wherever cats and fleas are found.
Fleaborne parasites, such as tapeworms can spread to people and animals if they accidentally swallow an infected flea. Small children are at a higher risk than adults, as they may spend more time close to the floor and carpeted areas where fleas are found. Most infected people will not show symptoms and will not know they are carrying tapeworms.
How it spreads
How fleas spread disease
Fleas transmit germs that cause disease primarily through the processes of feeding on hosts or through fecal contamination, when infected flea feces (poop; also called “flea dirt”) are scratched into an open wound.
How fleas find their hosts
Fleas prefer animal hosts but will resort to biting people when animals are unavailable. Adult fleas find hosts by detecting body heat, movement, the vibrations caused by movement, and breathing.

Influenza (Flu)
Flu and People with Asthma
AT A GLANCE
Asthma is a lung disease that is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways.
People with asthma are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, even if their asthma is mild or their symptoms are well-controlled by medication.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people with asthma because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications.
People with asthma who get flu symptoms should call their health care provider right away. There are antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness and help prevent serious flu complications.
About asthma
Asthma is a lung disease that is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways. It is one of the most common long-term diseases among children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma attacks occur when the lung airways tighten due to inflammation. Asthma attacks can be caused by ""triggers"" such as respiratory infections, allergy particles, chemical irritants, and air pollution. During an asthma attack, a person with asthma can experience symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Often, asthma attacks can be prevented by limiting one's exposure to triggers and by properly using asthma medications.
Keep Reading:
Asthma
Flu and people with asthma
People with asthma can develop swollen and sensitive airways, and flu can cause further inflammation of the airways and lungs. Flu can trigger asthma attacks and cause worsening of asthma symptoms. Flu also can lead to pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases. In fact, adults and children with asthma are more likely to develop pneumonia after getting sick with flu than people who do not have asthma. Asthma is the most common medical condition among children hospitalized with flu and one of the more common medical conditions among adults hospitalized with flu.
Prevention
A flu shot is the best protection against flu
Flu vaccination is especially important for people with asthma because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications.

Benefits of flu vaccination
Flu vaccines for people with asthma
Most injectable influenza vaccines (or flu shots) are approved for use in people 6 months and older, regardless of whether or not they have asthma or other health conditions. Flu shots have a long-established safety record in people with asthma.
People with asthma should generally not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine (i.e., the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV).
People with asthma who are aged 5 years and older, talk to your health care provider before getting the nasal spray vaccine.
Children 2 to 4 years old who have asthma or who have had a history of wheezing in the past 12 months should not get the nasal spray vaccine.

Pneumococcal vaccination is also important
Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death.
People who have asthma should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccination helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections.
You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine.
Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.

Pneumococcal Vaccination
Specific health actions for people with asthma
Take asthma medication exactly as your doctor or other medical professional tells you to do. Know how to use your asthma inhaler if your doctor of other medical professional tells you to use one.
Plan ahead to maintain sufficient supplies of your regular medications for chronic medical conditions (e.g., at least a two-week supply).
Know and avoid the asthma triggers that can cause you to have an asthma attack.
Follow an updated, written Asthma Action Plan developed with your health care provider.
Follow this Asthma Action Plan for daily treatment to control asthma long-term and to handle worsening asthma, or attacks.
If your child has asthma, make sure that their up-to-date written Asthma Action Plan is on file at school and/or at the daycare center. Be sure that the plan and medication(s) are easy to get to when needed.
Other preventive actions
In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with asthma should take the same everyday preventive actions CDC recommends for everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.

Symptoms and treatment
Because you are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, if you get sick with flu symptoms call your health care provider right away. There are antiviral drugs that can treat flu illness and help prevent serious flu complications.
Influenza antiviral drugs are medicines that fight against flu by keeping influenza viruses from making more viruses in your body. People with asthma should not use the antiviral drug zanamivir (trade name Relenza®) because there is a risk it may cause wheezing in people with asthma or other lung problems.

Flu and People with Diabetes
WHAT TO KNOW
It is important for people with diabetes to get annual flu vaccinations to prevent flu and serious flu complications.
People with diabetes should avoid the nasal spray flu vaccine, opting for injectable vaccines.
If you have diabetes and experience flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away.
CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with diabetes who have flu infection or suspected flu infection.
Background
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant). More than 122 million Americans are living with diabetes (37.3 million) or prediabetes (96 million). People with diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational), even when well-managed, are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. These complications can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death. Flu-related complications include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections. About 30% of adults hospitalized with flu reported to the CDC had diabetes in recent seasons. Acute illnesses like the flu can make controlling blood sugar levels harder. The flu may raise blood sugar levels. For example, a reduced appetite when sick can cause blood sugar levels to fall. People with diabetes need to follow the sick day guidelines if they become ill.
Vaccination is the best protection against flu
Flu vaccination is especially important for people with diabetes because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. Flu vaccination also has been associated with reduced hospitalizations among people with diabetes (79%)
.
Flu Vaccines for People with Diabetes
Injectable influenza vaccines (flu shots) are recommended for use in people with diabetes and certain other health conditions. Flu shots have a long, established safety record and studies
support the safety of flu vaccines in people with diabetes.
People with diabetes should generally not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine (i.e., the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV). Your doctor or other health care professional can answer any questions you might have about flu vaccine.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also important
Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death.
People with diabetes should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccination helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections.
You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine.
Pneumococcal vaccination should be part of a diabetes management plan. Talk to your healthcare provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.
Other Preventive Actions for People with Diabetes
In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with diabetes should follow the CDC's everyday preventive actions. These include avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. They can also take steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.

Flu and People Living with HIV
WHAT TO KNOW
People with HIV (PWH) are at higher risk of serious flu-related complications.
Due to this risk, it is especially important that PWH get a flu shot each year.
If you have HIV and get sick with flu symptoms, call your doctor right away.
CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with HIV who have flu or suspected flu.
Populations at increased risk
People living with HIV (PWH) are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications, especially those who have a very low CD4 cell count (very suppressed immune system) or who are not taking medicine to treat HIV (called antiretroviral therapy, or ART). Of all PWH in the United States from 2018–19, 81% were prescribed ART, leaving nearly 20% potentially at increased risk for flu complications. Studies have indicated that flu symptoms might be prolonged and the risk of flu-related complications and prolonged influenza virus shedding
is higher for certain people living with HIV.
Because they are at higher risk of serious flu-related complications, it is especially important that PWH get a flu shot annually. PWH who are not receiving ART might not have as strong an immune response to vaccination as those who are receiving ART. PWH who get flu symptoms, especially those with low CD4 cell counts not receiving ART, should be treated with influenza antiviral drugs right away.
About HIV
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV attacks cells in the body's immune system called CD4 cells. If untreated, it gradually destroys the body's ability to fight infection and certain cancers. CDC estimates that nearly 1.2 million people in the United States 13 years and older were living with HIV at the end of 2019, the most recent year of available data.
Prevention
A flu shot is the best protection against flu
If you have HIV, you are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications, in addition to taking ART, the best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu shot.
Several randomized studies in adults living with HIV have shown that flu vaccination can reduce the risk of flu illness. Studies in the United States have shown that flu vaccination prevents illness and reduces the need for doctor's visits among PWH and other conditions resulting in immune suppression.
People living with HIV should get a flu shot (not the nasal spray flu vaccine) every year. Injectable flu vaccines (or flu shots) are recommended for use in PWH and other health conditions. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine [LAIV] (nasal spray) vaccine should not be used in people with HIV and AIDS. LAIV (FluMist®) contains a weakened form of the live influenza virus and is not recommended for use in people with weakened immune systems (immunosuppression).
Note: While PWH may still mount an immune response to flu vaccination, people with advanced HIV disease may not respond as well. Doctors may consider using influenza antiviral drugs for prevention in some cases.
Make a statement this flu season.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also important
Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death.
PWH should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination to protect against pneumococcal disease, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections.
You can get either Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (but not both) when you get a flu vaccine.
Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you.

Pneumococcal Vaccination
Other preventive actions for people with living with HIV

Influenza (Flu)
Who Needs a Flu Vaccine
WHAT TO KNOW
Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza.
Flu Vaccine
A number of flu vaccines will be available this season. These include:
injectable flu vaccines, or flu shots. These include:
Flu shots that are made with inactivated influenza viruses.
One flu shot that is made without influenza viruses.
A live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is given by nasal spray.
People who can get the flu shot
Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza.
Flu vaccination has important benefits. It can reduce flu illnesses, visits to doctor's offices, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as make symptoms less severe and reduce flu-related hospitalizations and deaths in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.
Get vaccinated before flu season starts
It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body.
Recommended vaccines depend on a person's age and other characteristics
There are standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines that are approved for people as young as 6 months of age.
Some vaccines are only approved for adults. For example, the recombinant flu vaccine is approved for people 18 years and older, and the adjuvanted and high-dose inactivated vaccines are approved for people 65 years and older.
For people younger than 65 years, CDC does not recommend any one flu vaccine over another.
For adults 65 years and older, there are 3 flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended. These are Fluzone High-Dose inactivated flu vaccine, Flublok recombinant flu vaccine, and Fluad adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine. If none of the 3 flu vaccines preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older is available at the time of administration, people in this age group can get any other age-appropriate flu vaccine instead.
For many people who are 2 years through 49 years of age, the nasal spray flu vaccine is an option. The nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for people with some medical conditions. Also, if you are pregnant, you should not get the nasal spray flu vaccine.
In general, each person should get an age-appropriate flu vaccine (that is, one that is approved for their age). However, solid organ transplant recipients who are 18 through 64 years of age and who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive high-dose inactivated flu vaccine or adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine (which are currently approved for people ages 65 years and older). These vaccines are not preferred over other age-appropriate flu vaccines but are acceptable options for this population.
High-dose inactivated flu vaccine, recombinant flu vaccine, and adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine are preferred for people 65 years of age and older. There are no other preferential recommendations for specific flu vaccines for specific groups of people.
Keep Reading:
Vaccines and People with Egg Allergies
There are many vaccine options
If you are pregnant or have certain chronic health conditions, you should get a flu shot.
People with egg allergy may get any vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg.
The most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year.
When to get vaccinated against flu
For most people who need only one dose of influenza vaccine for the season, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Additional considerations concerning the timing of vaccination for certain groups of people include:
Most adults, especially those 65 years and older, and pregnant women in the first or second trimester should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time. However, early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated.
Some children need two doses of influenza vaccine. For those children, it is recommended that the first dose be given as soon as vaccine is available because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for children who need only one dose.
Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for mothers who are in the third trimester of pregnancy, because this can help protect their infants for the first few months after birth (when they are too young to be vaccinated).
<!-- Flu Finder Widget !-->
People who SHOULD NOT get a flu shot
Children younger than 6 months of age are too young to get a flu shot.
People with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine (other than egg proteins) should not get that vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.
People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine in the past, it is important to talk with your health care provider to help determine whether vaccination is appropriate for you.
People who should talk to their health care provider before getting a flu shot
Different influenza vaccines are approved for use in people in different age groups. In addition, some vaccines are not recommended for certain groups of people. Factors that can determine a person’s suitability for vaccination, or vaccination with a particular vaccine, include a person’s age, health (current and past) and any allergies to influenza vaccine or its components.
Children younger than 6 months of age are too young to get a flu shot.
People with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine (other than egg proteins) should not get that vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.
People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine in the past, it is important to talk with your health care provider to help determine whether vaccination is appropriate for you.
Prioritized for flu vaccination during a vaccine shortage
When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to the following people (no hierarchy is implied by order of listing):
Children aged 6 months through 4 years (59 months);
People aged 50 years and olderA;
People with chronic pulmonary (including asthma) or cardiovascular (except isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus);
People who are immunosuppressed due to any cause, including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection;
Mothers who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season and up to 2 weeks postpartum (after delivery);
People who are aged 6 months through 18 years who are receiving aspirin or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;
People who are residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities;
American Indian or Alaska Native persons;
People with extreme obesity (body-mass index [BMI] is 40 or greater);
Health care personnel;
Household contacts and caregivers of children under 5 years and adults 50 years and older; and
Household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at increased risk for severe illness from influenza.

Healthy Swimming
Preventing Hot Tub Rash
KEY POINTS
If contaminated water stays on someone's skin for a long time, it can cause a rash known as ""hot tub rash"" (Pseudomonas folliculitis).
Hot tub rash is caused by the germ Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is commonly found in the environment (for example, in water or soil).
Symptoms of hot tub rash
Hot tub rash usually appears a few days after sitting in a poorly maintained hot tub.
Hot tub rash can affect people of all ages. It is often worse in areas where a swimsuit held contaminated water up against the skin. Symptoms include:
Itchy, red, and bumpy rash
Pus-filled blisters around hair follicles
Mild rashes usually clear up in a few days without medical treatment. Check with your healthcare provider if a rash gets worse or if you get it more than once.
Prevention steps and strategies
To reduce the risk of hot tub rash
Remove your swimsuit and shower with soap after getting out of the water, especially hot tubs.
Wash your swimsuit after using it.
Use test strips to check the water, especially in hot tubs, for adequate disinfectant level and pH. CDC recommends the following disinfectant (chlorine or bromine) and pH levels for hot tubs:
Chlorine: at least 3 parts per million (ppm or mg/L). If the reading is above 10ppm, talk to the operator or owner.
Bromine: 4–8 ppm
pH: 7.0–7.8
If chlorine level, bromine level, or pH is not within the correct range, tell the operator or owner immediately.

Food Allergies in Schools
AT A GLANCE
A food allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly responds to food as if it were harmful.
The body’s immune response can be severe and life threatening.
There is no cure for food allergies.
Why it's an issue
Food allergies are a growing food safety and public health concern in the United States.
An estimated 1 in 13 children (8%), or 2 students per classroom, are affected with food allergies.
At least 2 in 5 children (40%) have been treated in the emergency department for food allergy reactions.
There is no cure for food allergies.
Strict avoidance of the food allergen is the only way to prevent a reaction.
When immediate care is needed
Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that may cause death.
Fast facts
The immune system normally protects people from germs. In people with food allergies, the immune system mistakenly responds to food as if it were harmful.
The symptoms and severity of allergic food reactions can differ among people. Symptoms and severity can also be different for one person over time.
Early and quick recognition and treatment can prevent serious health problems or death. Eight foods or food groups account for most serious allergic reactions in the United States:
Milk
Eggs
Fish
Crustacean shellfish
Wheat
Soy
Peanuts
Tree nuts
Responding to food allergy emergency
It is not always easy or possible to avoid certain foods. Staff in schools, out-of-school time, and early care and education programs (ECE) should develop plans for food allergies. The plans should outline how to prevent an allergic reaction and respond to a food allergy emergency, including anaphylaxis.
What CDC is doing
CDC along with the U.S. Department of Education, several federal agencies, and many stakeholders developed Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies in Schools and Early Care and Education Programs. The guidelines have information and recommendations for five priority areas. Each priority area should be addressed in each school’s or ECE program’s Food Allergy Management Prevention Plan:
Ensure the daily management of food allergies in individual children.
Prepare for food allergy emergencies.
Provide professional development on food allergies for staff members.
Educate children and family members about food allergies.
Create and maintain a healthy and safe educational environment.

Radiation and Your Health
How Food Irradiation Works
KEY POINTS
Food irradiation is a tool to help keep food safe from germs.
It does not change the texture or appearance of food.
Food does not become radioactive.
The process is safe and effective.
Overview
Food irradiation is a food safety process that uses radiation to kill germs that cause food poisoning (foodborne illness). Food irradiation is safe, and its safety and efficacy have been endorsed by federal agencies and intergovernmental organizations.
How it works
Food irradiation works by exposing food to ionizing electromagnetic (gamma or x-ray) radiation. Food irradiation is considered a ""cold"" method, meaning it does not use heat to kill germs. Other food safety processes that you may be more familiar with, like pasteurization and canning, use heat.
The irradiation process happens after a food is produced and packaged. Food enters a chamber where it is exposed to a specific amount of radiation. The radiation penetrates the food and kills germs or prevents them from multiplying, and it does not linger in the food. Irradiation is one more protective step, but it does not replace other food safety measures.
Irradiation Process
1. Foods such as fresh meat and spices leave processing facilities and arrive at facilities that use radiation to kill germs that can make you sick.
2. At the irradiation facility, foods ride on a conveyor belt through an irradiation chamber.
3. In the chamber, foods pass under a beam of radiation. This kills germs by breaking the bonds that hold the germ's DNA together.
4. Once the food leaves the irradiation chamber, most of the germs are destroyed.
5. The irradiated food goes to grocery stores and food service facilities.
6. You can identify irradiated foods by looking for the Radura symbol. It will be on the food label with one of these statements: ""Treated with Radiation"" or ""Treated by Irradiation.""
Impacts
Irradiation can make foods safer that are typically eaten raw, like some produce. Irradiation can also make raw foods that you cook at home, like ground beef, safer to handle. That's because irradiation kills most of the germs in the food before you buy it. Think of food irradiation as an added layer of protection against harmful germs that can make you sick.
What the research shows
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved food irradiation as a safe and effective process. Food irradiation has been evaluated for safety for over 30 years. Many agencies and organizations have endorsed its safety and effectiveness including:
Environmental Protection Agency
United States Department of Agriculture
World Health Organization
International Atomic Energy Agency
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Even astronauts eat irradiated food!

Clostridium perfringens Food Poisoning
About C. perfringens food poisoning
KEY POINTS
Almost 1 million people get C. perfringens food poisoning every year in the United States.
C. perfringens food poisoning can cause diarrhea and stomach cramps.
Food not kept at safe temperatures can cause C. perfringens food poisoning.
Overview
Clostridium perfringens bacteria are a common cause of food poisoning in the United States. CDC estimates that C. perfringens causes nearly 1 million foodborne illnesses in the United States each year.
How C. perfringens makes people sick
C. perfringens makes spores, which have protective coatings. After a person eats food contaminated with the C. perfringens, the bacteria can make a toxin (poison) that causes diarrhea.
Foods linked to C. perfringens food poisoning
Most often foods cooked in large batches and held at unsafe temperatures
(between 40°F and 140°F) are involved in outbreaks of C. perfringens food poisoning.
Some foods linked commonly to C. perfringens food poisoning include
Poultry, such as turkey and chicken
Meat, such as beef and pork
Gravy
Outbreaks linked to C. perfringens food poisoning
Outbreaks of C. perfringens food poisoning tend to happen in settings where large groups of people are served and keeping food at proper temperatures may be difficult. These settings include
Hospitals
School cafeterias
Prisons
Nursing homes, and
Large events with catered food
Most outbreaks happen in November and December. Many of them have been linked to popular holiday foods, such as turkey and roast beef.

Staphylococcal Food Poisoning
About Staph Food Poisoning
HIGHLIGHTS
Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) are bacteria.
Many people carry Staph on their skin and in their nose.
Staph can spread from unwashed hands and contaminate food.
After getting in food, Staph can multiply and make a toxin that causes food poisoning.
Overview
Staph food poisoning is a gastrointestinal illness. It is caused by toxins made by Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) bacteria.
About 1 in every 4 people and animals carries (has) Staph on their skin and in their nose. Staph usually do not cause illness in healthy people who carry it, but the bacteria have the ability to make toxins that can cause food poisoning.
Keep in mind
This page focuses on Staph food poisoning. You also can learn about Staph infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staph infections in healthcare settings.
Symptoms
Symptoms of Staph food poisoning include:
Nausea
Vomiting
Stomach cramps
Diarrhea
Symptoms usually start suddenly within 30 minutes to 8 hours after eating contaminated food. They last 24 hours or less.
Severe illness is rare.
Risk factors
Foods that are not cooked after handling are especially risky if contaminated with Staph. These foods include sliced meats, puddings, pastries, and sandwiches.
Foods that are cooked also can be risky if held at unsafe temperatures
(between 40°F and 140°F). Even though cooking can kill Staph, it does not destroy the toxin in the food.
How it spreads
Staph can contaminate food if people who carry the bacteria touch food without first washing their hands. Staph can multiply in contaminated food and make a toxin that causes food poisoning.
You can take steps to prevent Staph food poisoning.
Testing and diagnosis
Laboratory tests can detect toxin-producing Staph in stool, vomit, and foods. However, these tests are usually not ordered except during an outbreak.
If you have severe symptoms, contact your healthcare provider.
Your healthcare provider might suspect you have Staph food poisoning based on your symptoms and how soon they go away.
Treatment
Fluids
People with vomiting or diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Dehydration is not having enough water in the body.
People with severe illness may require intravenous (IV) fluids.
Medications
Talk to your healthcare provider about medication to help with nausea and vomiting, if needed.
Antibiotics are not used to treat Staph food poisoning because they do not affect the toxin.

Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network
About FoodNet
AT A GLANCE
FoodNet is a collaboration between CDC, USDA, FDA, and 10 state health departments.
FoodNet tracks infections caused by eight pathogens in a surveillance area that includes 16% of the U.S. population.
Personnel at each FoodNet site routinely communicate with clinical laboratories and collect detailed information about infections.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Purpose
The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) conducts surveillance for Campylobacter, Cyclospora, Listeria, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia infections diagnosed by laboratory testing of samples from patients. FoodNet also conducted surveillance for Cryptosporidium through 2017.
Objectives
Determine the burden of foodborne illness in the United States
Monitor trends in the burden of specific foodborne illness over time
Attribute the burden of foodborne illness to specific foods and settings
Disseminate information that can lead to improvements in public health practice and the development of interventions to reduce the burden of foodborne illness
Emerging infections
FoodNet is the principal foodborne disease component of CDC's Emerging Infections Program, which prevents and controls infectious diseases by providing the highest quality scientific information to monitor emergencies, evaluate public health interventions, inform policy, and measure progress in foodborne disease prevention.
Participating sites
FoodNet was established in July 1995 and is a collaborative program among CDC, 10 state health departments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS)
, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
FoodNet personnel located at state health departments regularly contact the clinical laboratories in Colorado
, Connecticut
, Georgia
, Maryland
, Minnesota
, New Mexico
, Oregon
, Tennessee
and selected counties in California
and New York
to get reports of infections diagnosed in residents of these areas.
View Larger
FoodNet's surveillance area includes 16% of the US population, which was approximately 54 million people in 2023.
What data we collect
FoodNet accomplishes its work through active surveillance; surveys of laboratories, physicians, and the general population; and population-based epidemiologic studies.
Active laboratory surveillance
FoodNet has conducted population-based surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed infections caused by Campylobacter, Listeria, Salmonella, STEC, Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia since 1996; Cyclospora since 1997; and STEC non-O157 since 2000. FoodNet also conducted surveillance for Cryptosporidium from 1997 through 2017. FoodNet began to collect information on infections identified by culture-independent methods in 2009 for STEC and Campylobacter and in 2011 for Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and Vibrio.
FoodNet is an active surveillance system, meaning that public health officials routinely communicate with more than 700 clinical laboratories serving the surveillance area to identify new infections and conduct periodic audits to ensure that all infections are reported.
FoodNet collects information on laboratory-diagnosed infections identified by culture or culture-independent diagnostic test (CIDT) for bacterial pathogens and microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for parasites. Personnel at each FoodNet site collect information about infections and share that information with CDC through FoodNet's database. The information includes
hospitalizations occurring within 7 days of the specimen collection date,
the patient's status (alive or dead) at hospital discharge (or at 7 days after the specimen collection date if the patient is not hospitalized),
whether the patient traveled abroad in the 7 days before illness began, and
selected food and environmental exposures.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome surveillance
FoodNet conducts surveillance for physician-diagnosed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) through a network of pediatric nephrologists and infection-control practitioners. FoodNet staff also review hospital discharge data for pediatric HUS cases to validate surveillance reports and identify additional cases by using ICD-9-CM/ICD-10 codes specifying HUS, acute renal failure with the hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with diarrhea caused by an unknown pathogen or E. coli.
Surveillance projects
In addition to routine surveillance, FoodNet occasionally conducts special surveillance projects. In 2002, two sites conducted population-based surveillance for reactive arthritis associated with Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and STEC infections. In 2009, FoodNet conducted a pilot surveillance program for community-acquired Clostridioides difficile infections (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) in Connecticut and New York. In 2010, FoodNet conducted a pilot surveillance program for Cronobacter sakazakii infections in selected sites.

Some members of the general population are exposed to an organism;
Some of these exposed people become ill;
Some of these ill people seek medical care;
A specimen is obtained from some of these people and submitted to a clinical laboratory;
A laboratory tests some of these specimens for a given pathogen;
The laboratory identifies the causative organism in some of these tested specimens and thereby confirms the case;
The laboratory-confirmed case is reported to a local or state health department.
FoodNet conducts laboratory surveys, physician surveys, and population surveys to collect information about each of these steps. This information is used to calculate estimates of the actual number of people who become ill. Other information is used to estimate the proportion of these illnesses transmitted by food.

What is FoodCORE
FoodCORE stands for Foodborne Diseases Centers for Outbreak Response Enhancement. It is a CDC program to enhance the ability of state and local health departments to respond to enteric disease outbreaks.
FoodCORE centers work together to develop improve methods to detect, investigate, respond to, and control multistate outbreaks of foodborne diseases. Efforts are primarily focused on outbreaks caused by bacteria, including Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and Listeria. The ability to detect and investigate viral and parasitic foodborne disease outbreaks will also be strengthened.
Why it's important
Each year in the United States foodborne diseases cause: 1
1 in 6 Americans (or about 48 million people) to become ill1
128,000 hospitalizations1
3,000 deaths1
Fast and effective outbreak investigations are needed to identify and remove contaminated food from the market to prevent additional illnesses. Identifying contaminated foods and learning how the contamination happened also help public health officials prevent similar outbreaks in the future. However, most health departments lack the resources to conduct comprehensive enteric disease surveillance and rapid, coordinated outbreak detection and response.
Did you know?
FoodCORE improves capacity to interview ill persons sooner and more comprehensively about what they ate, conduct faster subtyping of the bacteria that made them sick, and pool information swiftly to determine sources of more contaminated foods, so solutions can be found more rapidly.
Program priorities
FoodCORE aims to improve enteric disease surveillance and outbreak response by providing targeted funding to strengthen capacity and collaboration. Program priorities include:
Funding laboratory, epidemiology, and environmental health staff
Developing collaborative surveillance and response programs
Conducting fast, coordinated, and standardized investigations
Developing and implementing performance metrics
Identifying and documenting replicable model practices.
FoodCORE centers work to increase collaboration across laboratory, epidemiology, and environmental health within their health department. Staff from each area play a critical role in ongoing enteric surveillance and outbreak response. This includes:
Learning a sick person's food, water, and environmenal exposures
Determining what bacteria, virus, or parasite made them sick
Assessing the environment where contamination may have occurred
With increased coordination between these three areas, the centers are able to:
Detect more outbreaks
Conduct thorough investigations
Control outbreaks faster
Protect other people from getting sick
Outcomes
Performance metrics were developed and tested by FoodCORE centers to measure the burden, timeliness, and completeness of foodborne disease activities. Metrics span from outbreak surveillance and detection through investigation, response, control, and prevention measures.
FoodCORE centers report data for Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and Listeria (SSL); and norovirus, other enteric disease pathogens, and outbreaks of unknown etiology (NOU).
Metrics data are shared online to show the impact of the changes that FoodCORE centers have implemented in their health departments.

FoodCORE Metrics
What's ahead
FoodCORE centers are at the forefront of enteric disease surveillance and outbreak response. They will continue to innovate and share their experiences with others. Their successes and lessons learned will be shared online and at conferences and meetings.
Documenting success
FoodCORE centers are test kitchens for new ideas to investigate and respond to outbreaks of enteric illness. When they find something that works, a success story or model practice is written and published to the FoodCORE website. Other health departments can learn and implement these successful practices in their jurisdictions.
Success Stories
Success stories highlight outbreak investigations or projects that were particularly successful in a FoodCORE center. Topics of success stories include:
Contributions to solving large or multi-state outbreaks
Adaptation to changing laboratory methods
Collaboration within a FoodCORE center and across centers
Novel strategies to detect more cases or interview more thoroughly
Keep Reading:
FoodCORE Success Stories
Model Practices
Model practices describe what's been successful in FoodCORE centers. When a practice works across centers with varying sizes, structure, and burden, it's likely to work in other jurisdictions too. These practices are documented so that others can learn from FoodCORE centers and replicate what's worked. Topics of published model practices include laboratory timeliness and completeness, initial case-patient interviewing, student interview teams, and team communication and collaboration. Model practices are periodically revised to ensure they remain accurate as methods and technologies evolve and advance.

How it's funded
FoodCORE centers were selected through a competitive application process via CDC’s Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases Cooperative Agreement.
Funding recipients
Started in 2009, the program has grown to include 10 state and local health departments. The centers cover 18% of the U.S. population, or 58 million people. The current FoodCORE centers are:

National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS)
Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System
ABOUT
FDOSS is CDC’s program for collecting and reporting data about foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States. It is a part of the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS).
What's collected
FDOSS collects information about foodborne disease outbreaks, such as
Date and location of the outbreak
Number of people who became ill and their symptoms
Food or drink implicated
Setting where the food or drink was prepared and eaten
Pathogen (germ, toxin, or chemical) that caused the outbreak
FDOSS uses the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC) food categorization scheme to organize, analyze, and interpret data about foods implicated in foodborne disease outbreaks.
How the data are used
CDC uses this information to better understand the germs, foods, settings, and contributing factors (for example, food not kept at the right temperature) involved in outbreaks. CDC also uses the information to identify emerging foodborne disease threats and to shape and assess outbreak prevention measures.
What outbreak information can provide
Why this information is important
Foods associated with outbreaks
Identifies foods most commonly reported in outbreaks, and changes in how frequently certain foods are implicated
Provides information on the causes of food contamination
Identifies germ-food pairs most often linked to outbreaks
Offers insight into how well prevention measures are working, which can lead to new policies and practices
Germs associated with outbreaks
Identifies germs reported in outbreaks, and changes in how frequently certain germs are implicated
Provides information on how specific germs affect people and the significance of these germs to the public’s health
Identifies germ-food pairs most often linked to outbreaks
Offers insight into how well prevention measures to reduce those germs are working, which can lead to new best practices and industry standards
Where germs contaminate food
Identifies points in the food production chain (for example, at a farm or production plant) and post-production (for example, during transportation, or at a grocery store, restaurant, or home) where germs contaminate food
Offers insight into how well prevention measures to reduce those germs are working, which can lead to new best practices and industry standards
Places outbreaks happen, including where food is made and eaten
Tells us where outbreaks are more likely to occur, and if those places are changing over time
Points out food preparation and handling practices that can lead to outbreaks
Offers insight into how well prevention measures are working, which can lead to new best practices and industry standards
A brief history of U.S. foodborne disease outbreak reporting
1923: The Public Health Service begins publishing annual summaries of foodborne disease outbreaks linked to milk.
1938: The Public Health Service expands reporting to all foodborne outbreaks.
1961: CDC, then called the Communicable Disease Center, takes over reporting from the Public Health Service.
1961–1965: CDC provides outbreak statistics and accounts of individual outbreaks in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).
1966: In response to growing interest in foodborne diseases, CDC resumes publishing annual summaries of foodborne disease outbreaks.
1966–1982: CDC publishes outbreak data as stand-alone booklets.
1982–2010: CDC returns to publishing reports in MMWR.
2011: CDC begins to post annual summaries online.
2018–2024: CDC publishes data in NORS Dashboard.
2024: CDC migrates NORS data to Bacteria, Enterics, Amoeba, and Mycotics (BEAM) Dashboard, a more comprehensive web-based tool for searching and accessing CDC data.

Background information
What's a foodborne illness?
A foodborne illness occurs when someone gets sick after consuming a contaminated food or drink. It is also called foodborne disease, foodborne infection, or food poisoning. More than 250 agents are known to cause foodborne illness. These agents include germs (such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites) and chemicals (such as ciguatoxin).
What's a foodborne disease outbreak?
A foodborne disease outbreak occurs when two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink. Nearly all of the more than 250 agents known to cause foodborne illness can cause an outbreak.

CDC’s estimates of the burden of foodborne illness in the United States provide the most accurate picture of known pathogens and unspecified agents causing foodborne illness in the United States.
These estimates serve as a foundation for food safety by allowing us to answer important questions, such as:
How many foodborne illnesses occur every year?
These estimates are known as the burden of foodborne illness.
Which foods are responsible for the illnesses?
These estimates are known as the attribution of foodborne illness.
By estimating the burden of foodborne illness and attributing illnesses to specific food sources, CDC, regulatory agencies, industry, consumer groups, and others can better target prevention measures and improve food safety in the United States.

Meningitis
ESPAÑOL (PUERTO RICO)
About Fungal Meningitis
KEY POINTS
Fungal meningitis is a rare fungal infection of areas around the brain and spine.
In people with weak immune systems, fungal infections anywhere in the body can develop into fungal meningitis.
Rarely, it can be caused by contamination during medical procedures.
It is difficult to diagnose and requires antifungal treatment.
What it is
Fungal meningitis is very rare and causes swelling in areas around the brain and spinal cord.
In people with weak immune systems
In people with weak immune systems a fungal infection anywhere in the body can spread to the brain and spine. For example, breathing in fungal spores outdoors can cause a lung infection that can spread and lead to fungal meningitis.
Some fungi that can cause infections leading to fungal meningitis include:
Blastomyces
Candida
Coccidioides
Cryptococcus
Histoplasma
Associated with medical procedures
Rarely, people can get fungal meningitis after medical procedures if all infection control practices are not followed. Contaminated medicines or medical equipment can allow fungi to get into the brain or spinal cord. This can happen with many types of fungi.
Keep Reading:
Fungal Diseases
Symptoms
People with fungal meningitis may start off with mild symptoms that develop into typical meningitis symptoms.
fever
headache
stiff neck
nausea
vomiting
light sensitivity
confusion
When to seek emergency care
Anyone with symptoms of meningitis should see a healthcare provider right away. A healthcare provider can determine if you have meningitis, what's causing it, and the best treatment.
Risk factors
Anyone can get fungal meningitis, but some people are at increased risk.
Typically, only people with weakened immune systems develop fungal meningitis from fungal infections. Certain health conditions (like HIV infection and cancer), medications, and surgical procedures may weaken the immune system. Medications that can weaken the immune system include:
Steroids (such as prednisone)
Medicines given after organ transplantation
Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) medicines
Anti-TNF medicines are sometimes given to treat rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune conditions.
Who is at risk
Premature babies with very low birth weights are at increased risk for getting Candida bloodstream infection. These infections can spread to the brain.
Living in certain areas of the United States may increase the risk for fungal lung infections. These infections can spread to the brain or spinal cord.
People who have surgical procedures can get fungal meningitis, but it is very rare.
Keep Reading:
Fungal Meningitis Outbreaks: Caring for Yourself and Others
How it spreads
Fungal lung infections anywhere in the body can spread to the brain.
From the environment
Many fungi that can cause meningitis live in the environment. People can get sick if they breathe in fungal spores.
From inside and on the body
Candida normally lives inside the gut and on the skin without causing any problems. However, Candida can enter the bloodstream or internal organs and cause an infection.
Associated with healthcare procedures
While rare, outbreaks of fungal meningitis following medical and surgical procedures have occurred. People can get infected during medical procedures if all infection control practices aren't followed.
Keep Reading:
Fungal Meningitis Outbreak—2023
Information for healthcare providers
Diagnostic testing for fungal meningitis is challenging. Testing and treatment options are applicable regardless of where exposure occurred.
Testing and treatment options
How it doesn't spread
Fungal meningitis doesn't spread between people.
Reducing risk
People with weak immune systems can take steps to reduce their risk. It's especially important for those who live in areas where these fungi are found.
Avoid exposure to dust and dirt
Try to avoid areas with a lot of dust like construction or excavation sites. If they're unavoidable, wear an N95 respirator (a type of face mask) while there.
Keep Reading:
Respirators
Stay inside during dust storms and close windows.
Avoid activities that involve close contact with dirt or dust.
Use good wound care
Clean skin injuries well with soap and water to reduce the chances of developing a skin infection. This is especially important if the wound was exposed to dirt or dust.
Other prevention strategies
Use air filtration measures indoors.
Take preventive antifungal medication if prescribed.
Testing and diagnosis
There are laboratory tests for meningitis. Tests might include a spinal tap, where a long needle collects fluid from around the spine for testing.
Treatment and recovery
Healthcare providers treat fungal meningitis with high-dose antifungal medicines, often given directly into a vein through an IV. After that, people also need to take antifungal medicines by mouth.
The total length of treatment depends on each person's immune system and the type of fungus causing the infection. Treatment is often longer for people with weak immune systems.
Fungal meningitis is treated with high-dose IV antifungal medications.

Future Leaders in Infections and Global Health Threats (FLIGHT) launched in 2019 as a three-year program. Fellows, called FLIGHT officers, gain the skills to be effective leaders as they address global public health threats. Officers translate public health science and research into successful infectious disease programs with global applications.
The FLIGHT program combines detailed teaching and experience-based training to meet performance and public health service requirements. This includes:
Skill assessment
Educational seminars
Professional coaching
Global rotations
Programmatic work
Leadership networking
FLIGHT officers are selected from recent graduating classes of CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS). This includes physicians, veterinarians, doctoral scientists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals.
Eligible candidates must be US citizens. Candidates with clinical qualifications must also have an unrestricted license to practice their clinical specialty.
