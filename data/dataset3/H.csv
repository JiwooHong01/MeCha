Information on Swine / Variant Influenza
Interim Guidance on Case Definitions for Investigations of Influenza A (H3N2)v Virus Cases
PURPOSE
This document provides updated interim guidance for state and local health departments conducting investigations of infections with influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) viruses. Influenza viruses that typically infect swine are referred to as “variant” when they infect humans. The following definitions are for the purpose of investigations of confirmed cases and cases of influenza A (H3N2)v virus infection under investigation. CDC is requesting notification of all confirmed cases of influenza A (H3N2)v virus infection within 24 hours of identification. When possible, state health departments are encouraged to investigate all potential cases of influenza A (H3N2)v virus infection further to determine case status.
Case Definitions for Infection with Influenza A (H3N2)v Virus
Confirmed: Influenza A (H3N2)v virus infection in a patient with laboratory confirmation by:
Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing or genetic sequencing results positive for influenza A (H3N2)v virus at the CDC Influenza Division Laboratory
OR
RT-PCR testing results at a public health laboratory consistent with influenza A (H3N2)v virus using a CDC-approved assay (for example, InfA, H3, and pdmInfA positive results, and H1 and pdmH1 negative results using the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel)1. Please see Interim Guidance on Specimen Collection, Processing, and Testing for Patients with Suspect Influenza A (H3N2)v Virus Infection for additional guidance on testing for H3N2v viruses.
Case Under Investigation: Illness compatible with influenza2 in a patient meeting at least one of the epidemiologic criteria below for whom laboratory confirmation is not known or pending, or for whom test results do not provide a sufficient level of detail to confirm influenza A (H3N2)v virus (e.g., a positive rapid influenza diagnostic test).
Recent close contact3 (within 7 days of illness onset) with confirmed cases of influenza A (H3N2)v virus infection
OR
Recent contact (within 7 days of illness onset) with swine or recent attendance at an event (such as an agricultural fair) where swine were present. Contact with swine may be direct contact (i.e., touching or handling a pig) or indirect contact (coming within about 6 feet (2 meters) of a pig without known direct contact).
1 This laboratory result is reportable as ""presumptive positive"" for influenza A (H3N2v) as specified in the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel in vitro diagnostic (IVD) package insert. Although State public health laboratories are able to report and act upon this result, all specimens with ""presumptive positive"" results should be sent to CDC for additional testing. Please see Data Interpretation Update to the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel for additional guidance on interpretation of the CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel.
2 Illness compatible with influenza may present as influenza-like illness (ILI) [fever ≥100°F plus cough or sore throat]. Note that influenza may not cause fever in all patients (especially in patients under 5 years of age, over 65 years of age, or patients with immune-suppression), and the absence of fever should not supersede clinical judgment when evaluating a patient for illness compatible with influenza.
3 Close contact may be regarded as coming within about 6 feet (2 meters) of a confirmed case while the case was ill (beginning 1 day prior to symptom onset and continuing until resolution of illness). This includes healthcare personnel providing care for a confirmed case, family members of a confirmed case, persons who lived with or stayed overnight with a confirmed case, and others who have had similar close physical contact.

WHAT TO KNOW
Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs.
Influenza viruses that commonly circulate in swine are called “swine influenza viruses” or “swine flu viruses.”
Like human influenza viruses, there are different subtypes and strains of swine influenza viruses.
The main swine influenza viruses circulating in U.S. pigs in recent years have been, swine triple reassortant (tr) H1N1 influenza virus, trH3N2 virus, and trH1N2 virus.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called ""variant viruses."" They also can be denoted by adding the letter ""v"" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States.

Clinical Safety: Hand Hygiene for Healthcare Workers
KEY POINTS
Protect yourself and your patients from deadly germs by cleaning your hands.
All healthcare personnel should understand how to care for and clean their hands.
Why it matters
Hand hygiene protects both healthcare personnel and patients. Hand hygiene means cleaning your hands with:
Handwashing with water and soap (e.g., plain soap or with an antiseptic).
Antiseptic hand rub (alcohol-based foam or gel hand sanitizer).
Surgical hand antisepsis.
Cleaning your hands reduces:
The potential spread of deadly germs to patients.
The spread of germs, including those resistant to antibiotics.
The risk of healthcare personnel colonization or infection caused by germs received from the patient.
Some healthcare personnel may need to clean their hands as often as 100 times during a work shift to keep themselves, patients and staff safe. A common challenge is keeping the skin on your hands healthy and clean.
Background
CDC provides the following recommendations for hand hygiene in healthcare settings.
Recommendations
EXPAND ALL
Know when to clean your hands
Know when to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) versus soap and water during routine patient care
Know how to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS)
Know how to wash hands with soap and water
Know the safety risks of refilling or “topping off” alcohol-based hand sanitizer (AHBS) and soap
Know when to wear (and change) gloves
Follow specific recommendations when treating a patient with confirmed or suspected C. difficile infection
Follow hand hygiene recommendations for surgery:
Maintain hand skin health
Maintain fingernail and jewelry safety
Healthcare facilities: Make hand hygiene a priority
Special issues: Fire safety and ABHS
Ensure fire safety when using ABHS
ABHS contains ethyl alcohol, which evaporates at room temperature into an ignitable vapor, and is considered a flammable liquid. Although ABHS-related fires are rare it is vital that ABHS is stored safely and bulk dispensers are installed and maintained correctly.
Follow local and state fire safety laws and standards
Building officers and fire marshals work together to enforce fire safety rules to protect patients and residents.
Fire safety activities help to:
Reduce sources of ignition.
Ensure safe storage of flammable liquids.
Establish quick exits in case of fire.
Building officers and local fire marshals also work together to ensure ABHS dispensers are accessible and in locations that do not increase the risk of igniting or spreading a fire.
Adhere to the Life Safety Code
Adherence to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Life Safety Code 101 was adopted by CMS. This code is a minimum fire safety requirement for facilities that receive Medicaid or Medicare reimbursement. The Life Safety Code contains national standards for the storage of ABHS, as well as placement and function of dispensers. When facilities use ABHS the criteria listed in Table 1 must be met.
Life Safety Code
The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) requires healthcare facilities to follow the Life Safety Code.
Work with your local fire official
Healthcare facilities may contact their local fire officials to ensure they meet all requirements for the installation of ABHS. Local fire officials often inspect commercial buildings and may be required to do so.
Tours from local fire officials can help healthcare facilities:
Meet requirements.
Refresh their familiarity on structure.
Identify vulnerabilities within the facility.
There are several benefits to the healthcare facilities requesting a tour such as:
Building relationships with local fire officials.
Demonstrating a commitment to safety.
Table 1. NFPA 101 Life Safety Code Requirements for the use of ABHS Dispensers
Criteria
Requirement
Hand rub solution
Must not exceed 95% alcohol content by volume. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that ABHS contain at least 60% alcohol.)
Maximum dispenser fluid capacity
1.2 liters (41 ounces, 0.32 gallons) for dispensers in rooms, corridors, and areas open to corridors.
2.0 liters (67 ounces, 0.53 gallons) for dispensers in suites of rooms separated from corridors.
Maximum quantity in aerosol containers
18 ounces, limited to Level 1 aerosols as defined by NPFA 30 B.
Maximum quantity of ABHS allowed in-use (i.e., in dispensers)
Ten gallons (37.8 liters in-use outside of a storage cabinet within a single smoke compartment. (Smoke compartment: A space within a building enclosed by smoke barriers on all sides, including the top and bottom.)
One dispenser per room off corridors is NOT included in the calculation.
Minimum corridor width
Six feet (1830 millimeters) wide
ABHS dispenser distance from ignition sources
One-inch (25 millimeters) distance (horizontal or vertical) above, to the side, or beneath an ignition source. (Sources of ignition: Appliances or equipment that, because of their intended modes of use or operation, are capable of providing sufficient thermal energy to ignite flammable gas-air mixtures.5 Examples include wall outlets, thermostats, and appliances.)
Note: While one-inch is acceptable, a more conservative approach is to ensure a distance of no less than 6 inches (12.7 millimeters; horizontal or vertical, measured from the center of the dispenser) between ABHS dispensers and source of ignition.
ABHS dispenser separation
Horizontal spacing not less than 48 inches (1,220 millimeters).
Carpeted areas
The smoke compartment must be equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system.
Operation of the dispenser, the dispenser shall:
Not release its contents except when the dispenser is activated, either manually or automatically by touch-free activation.
Not dispense more solution than the amount required for hand hygiene consistent with label instructions.
Be designed, constructed and operated in a manner that ensures accidental or malicious activation is minimized.
Be tested in accordance with the manufacturer’s care and use instructions each time a new refill is installed.
Any activation of the dispenser shall only occur when an object is placed within 4 inches (100 millimeters) of the sensor.
An object placed within the activation zone and left in place shall not cause more than one activation.
Storage outside of dispensers
In each smoke compartment, do not store outside of dispensers more than 5 gallons (18.9 liters) or an amount of ABHS that exceeds that which is necessary for normal maintenance of the area, whichever is less.
Maximum quantity for storage in a warehouse
Up to 120 gallons (460 liters). If need to exceed storage of 120 gallons (460 liters), consult with fire official.12

About Handwashing
KEY POINTS
Many diseases and conditions are spread by not washing hands with soap and clean, running water.
Handwashing with soap is one of the best ways to stay healthy.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands.
Why it's important
Washing hands can keep you healthy and prevent the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections. Germs can spread from person to person or from surfaces to people when you:
Touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands
Prepare or eat food and drinks with unwashed hands
Touch surfaces or objects that have germs on them
Blow your nose, cough, or sneeze into hands and then touch other people's hands or common objects
Key times to wash hands
You can help yourself and your loved ones stay healthy by washing your hands often, especially during these key times when you are likely to get and spread germs:
Before, during, and after preparing food
Before and after eating food
Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea
Before and after treating a cut or wound
After using the toilet
After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste
After handling pet food or pet treats
After touching garbage
How it works
Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Follow these five steps every time.
Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.
Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
Dry your hands using a clean towel or an air dryer.
Use hand sanitizer when you can't use soap and water
Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label.

Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD)
About Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease
KEY POINTS
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is common in children under 5 years old, but anyone can get it.
The illness is usually not serious, but it is very contagious.
To prevent spreading HFMD, wash your hands often, clean and disinfect surfaces, and avoid close contact with others.
What it is
HFMD is a common illness that usually causes fever, mouth sores, and skin rash. It can spread quickly at schools and day care centers. Most people get better on their own in 7 to 10 days.
Signs and symptoms
Most children have mild symptoms for 7 to 10 days. Symptoms may include:
Fever
Sore throat
Painful mouth sores that blister
Rash commonly found on the hands and feet
Complications from HFMD are rare.
Keep Reading:
Detailed HFMD Symptoms and When to See a Doctor
A rash on the palms and soles is a common sign of HFMD.
Who is at risk
HFMD is most common in infants and children younger than 5 years old.
If you are pregnant, contact your doctor if you think you may have been exposed to HFMD. Complications from HFMD are rare. However, your own medical history and how far along you are in your pregnancy can affect the situation.
How it spreads
HFMD is caused by viruses. A person infected with one of these viruses is contagious. This means they can pass the virus easily to other people.
HFMD can spread through contact with:
Droplets with virus particles made after person sneezes, coughs, or talks
Objects and surfaces that have virus particles
Fluid from blisters
Poop
Keep Reading:
HFMD: Causes and How It Spreads
Prevention
HFMD is very contagious. To help prevent catching or spreading HFMD:
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after changing diapers, using the toilet, and coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.
Help children wash their hands and keep blisters clean.
Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and shared items, including toys and doorknobs.
Avoid close contact with an infected person, such as hugging or kissing them.
There is no vaccine in the United States to protect against the viruses that cause HFMD.
Teach children how to wash hands often to prevent HFMD from spreading.
Treatment and recovery
HFMD is usually not serious. Most people get better on their own in 7 to 10 days with minimal or no medical treatment. You can take steps to manage symptoms while you or your child are sick.
Manage symptoms at home
Relieve pain and fever. Take over-the-counter medications to relieve fever and pain caused by mouth sores. Never give aspirin to children.
Prevent dehydration (loss of fluids). You can take steps to relieve symptoms and prevent dehydration while you or your child are sick. Drink enough liquids. Mouth sores can make it painful to swallow, so your child may not want to drink much. Make sure they drink enough to stay hydrated.
When to return to school
Because HFMD is normally mild, children can continue to go to child care and schools as long as they:
Have no fever.
Feel well enough to participate in class.
Have no uncontrolled drooling with mouth sores.
Talk with your child’s healthcare provider if you are still not sure when it is okay for them to return. Sometimes, the local health department may require children with HFMD to stay home to control an outbreak.

The Life is Better with Clean Hands Campaign
Hansen's Disease (Leprosy)
About Hansen's Disease (Leprosy)
KEY POINTS
Each year, up to 225 people in the U.S. and 250,000 around the world are diagnosed with Hansen's disease (also known as leprosy).
Hansen's disease was once feared as a highly contagious, devastating disease.
Now, we know that it's hard to spread and easily treatable.
People with Hansen's disease can live an active life during and after treatment.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Hansen's disease is caused by slow-growing bacteria called Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. The disease can affect the nerves, skin, eyes, and lining of the nose. In some cases, body parts may lose their sense of touch and pain, increasing the likelihood of injuries such as cuts and burn.
Despite the disease being hard to catch and completely curable, a lot of stigma and prejudice remains against those who have Hansen's disease. Individuals affected by the disease often face social isolation and discrimination, particularly in regions where the illness is prevalent.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms mainly affect the skin, nerves, and lining of the nose.
Keep Reading:
Signs and Symptoms of Hansen's Disease
How long it takes for signs to show
The bacteria that causes Hansen's disease grows very slowly. After contact with the bacteria, it may take up to 20 years for someone to develop signs of the disease.
Risk factors
In the United States, Hansen's disease is rare. Most people with Hansen's disease in the U.S. became infected in a country where it is more common.
You may be at risk for the disease if you live in a country where the disease is widespread. According to WHO data from 2019:
Brazil, India and Indonesia reported more than 10,000 new cases
Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka and the United Republic of Tanzania each reported 1000–10,000 new cases.
How it spreads
Most people cannot get Hansen's disease
Around 95% of all people cannot be infected because their immune system can fight off the bacteria that causes Hansen's disease.
Keep Reading:
How Hansen's Disease Spreads
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers can diagnose Hansen's disease by conducting an exam and running diagnostic tests, like skin biopsies. They may look for patches of skin that may look lighter, darker, or redder than the person's normal skin and determine if those patches have a loss of feeling.
To confirm the diagnosis, healthcare providers will take a skin or nerve sample to look for the bacteria that cause Hansen's disease under the microscope. They may also do tests to rule out other skin diseases.
Treatment and recovery
Hansen's disease is treated with a combination of antibiotics. Treatment usually lasts between one to two years. The illness can be cured if treatment is completed as prescribed.
In the U.S., people with Hansen's disease may be treated at specialized clinics run by the National Hansen's Disease
. There are several federally supported outpatient clinics
throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
Myths and misconceptions
Myth: Hansen's disease is very contagious.
Fact: Hansen’s disease does not spread easily from person to person. You cannot get it through casual contact such as shaking hands, sitting next to, or talking to someone who has the disease.
Myth: There is no cure for Hansen's disease.
Fact: Hansen's disease is curable. People being treated for Hansen's disease can live a normal life among their family and friends and can continue to attend work or school.
Myth: Hansen's disease makes your fingers and toes fall off.
Fact: Fingers and toes do not just “fall off” due to Hansen's disease. The bacteria that cause the disease attacks the nerves of the fingers and toes, causing them to become numb. Injuries like burns, ulcers, and cuts on numb parts can go unnoticed, which may lead to permanent damage or infection, causing loss of the digit. Sometimes, the nerve damage makes muscles in the fingers and toes so weak that the muscles and bones begin to disintegrate and be reabsorbed by the body.
Hantavirus
VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
About Hantavirus
KEY POINTS
Hantaviruses are a family of viruses which can cause serious illnesses and death.
These viruses cause diseases like hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
They are spread mainly by rodents and are not spread from person-to-person.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Hantaviruses can infect and cause serious disease in people worldwide. People get hantavirus from contact with rodents like rats and mice, especially when exposed to their urine, droppings, and saliva. It can also spread through a bite or scratch by a rodent, but this is rare.
Hantaviruses cause two syndromes. Hantaviruses found in the Western Hemisphere, including here in the U.S., can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The most common hantavirus that causes HPS in the U.S. is spread by the deer mouse.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses found mostly in Europe and Asia. However, Seoul virus, a type of hantavirus that causes HFRS, is found worldwide, including in the United States.
Signs and symptoms
Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)
HPS is a severe and potentially deadly disease that affects the lungs. Symptoms of HPS usually start to show 1 to 8 weeks after contact with an infected rodent.
Early symptoms can include:
fatigue
fever
muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups like the thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders
About half of all HPS patients also experience:
headaches
dizziness
chills
abdominal problems, like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain
Four to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath. Patients might experience tightness in the chest, as the lungs fill with fluid.
HPS can be deadly. Thirty-eight percent of people who develop respiratory symptoms may die from the disease.
Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS)
HFRS is a severe and sometimes deadly disease that affects the kidneys. Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure. In rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to develop. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include:
intense headaches
back and abdominal pain
fever/chills
nausea
blurred vision
People may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include:
low blood pressure
lack of blood flow (acute shock)
internal bleeding (vascular leakage)
acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload
The severity of the disease varies depending on the virus causing the infection. Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections usually cause severe symptoms where 5-15% of cases are fatal. In contrast, Seoul, Saaremaa, and Puumala virus infections are usually more moderate with less than 1% dying from the disease. Complete recovery can take several weeks to months.
Reducing risk
Eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home, workplace, or campsite to reduce your risk of exposure to hantaviruses. Seal holes and gaps in your home or garage to keep rodents from entering these spaces. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food, that might attract rodents.
Diagnosis
Diagnosing hantavirus in a person who has been infected less than 72 hours is difficult. If the initial test is done before the virus can be detected, repeat testing is often done 72 hours after symptom start. Early symptoms such as fever, headache muscle aches, nausea, and fatigue are easily confused with influenza.
A diagnosis of HPS or HFRS may be considered in a patient with exposure to rodents and signs and symptoms compatible with HPS and HFRS. If you suspect hantavirus disease, see a physician immediately and mention a potential rodent exposure.
A diagnosis can be reached through testing at a state laboratory or CDC. If you have any questions or concerns regarding submitting a specimen or any public health emergency, please contact your state or local health department or contact the CDC's Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100.
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific treatment for hantavirus infection. Patients should receive supportive care, including rest, hydration, and treatment of symptoms.
HPS can cause breathing difficulties, and patients may need breathing support, such as intubation. Intubation is a medical procedure where a tube is placed in the lungs from the mouth to help the patient get oxygen.
HFRS can disrupt kidney function. Patients with HFRS may need dialysis to remove toxins from the blood and maintain the right balance of fluids in the body when the kidneys aren't working well.
Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
About Tick and Louse-borne Relapsing Fevers
KEY POINTS
Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria.
Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria: soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF), and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF).
Overview
Relapsing fever is an illness characterized by one or more episodes of fever, headache, and muscle pain that lasts several days and is separated by roughly a week of feeling well. Relapsing fever is caused by several species of Borrelia bacteria, which are distantly related to the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Relapsing fever Borrelia infections are categorized into three groups based on the animal that transmits the bacteria:
Soft tick relapsing fever (STRF), also known as tickborne relapsing fever
Hard tick relapsing fever (HTRF)
Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)
There are differences in how severe the infection can be and where a person may be exposed.

Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB)-Associated Illness
Harmful Algal Blooms and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Harmful algal blooms are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria in water that can harm people, animals, or the environment.
Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick.
Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad.
Overview
Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or ""bloom."" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick.
What they look like
Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see.
A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red.
Keep Reading:
How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom
When they're harmful
Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they:
Make toxins
Become too dense
Use up oxygen in the water
Release harmful gases
Types
Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick.
Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers.
Dinoflagellates or diatoms are the most common causes of harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays.
Keep Reading:
Types of Harmful Algal Blooms
Where they're found
Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or brackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for recreation and for drinking.
Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United States, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
What causes them
Algae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a harmful algal bloom when water is:
Warm
Slow-moving
Full of nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorous
Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or runoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans. This can happen during rainstorms, for example.
Environmental changes, such as warmer water, might be making harmful algal blooms worse.
Learn more about factors that help harmful algal blooms grow.
Health impacts
Harmful algal blooms cause a variety of mild to serious illnesses. Symptoms depend on the type of harmful algal bloom you come in contact with and how you are exposed.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
Harmful agal blooms can be deadly for animals
Contact a veterinarian immediately if your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water. Animals can get very sick or even die within hours of coming into contact with harmful algae or cyanobacteria. Learn more about protecting pets and livestock.
Risk of exposure
People and animals can get sick from having contact with water or food that contains certain types of algae, cyanobacteria, or their toxins.
You or your animals can get sick if you:
Go in or near water contaminated by a harmful algal bloom
Swallow contaminated water
Eat contaminated shellfish or fish
Use contaminated blue-green algae dietary supplements
Keep Reading:
How People and Animals Get Sick From Harmful Algal Blooms
Preventing exposure
You can take steps to avoid getting sick from harmful algal blooms. For example:
Stay out of discolored, scummy, or smelly water and keep pets away.
Check for and follow swimming, fishing, and shellfish advisories.
Follow guidance from local officials if there is a harmful algal bloom in your drinking water supply.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
After exposure
If you or your animal go in water with an algal bloom, rinse off with tap water right after.
If you think you have symptoms caused by a harmful algal bloom, contact a healthcare provider or the Poison Control hotline
at 1-800-222-1222.
If your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water, contact a veterinarian right away. You can also call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center
at 1-888-426-4435 or the Pet Poison Helpline
at 1-855-764-7661. Note that there is a fee for these calls.
What CDC is doing
CDC works with federal, state, local, and territorial partners to reduce the health impact of harmful algal blooms. This includes:
Public health research
Tracking harmful algal blooms and illnesses
Developing methods to detect toxins
Outreach and education
Providing health departments with financial and technical support

Nonpathogenic (Harmless) Intestinal Protozoa
PARASITES 
About Nonpathogenic (Harmless) Intestinal Protozoa
KEY POINTS
Nonpathogenic intestinal protozoa are single-celled parasites that are commonly found in the intestine.
They are harmless and do not cause illness.
There is no need for treatment.
Overview
Nonpathogenic intestinal protozoa are single-celled parasites commonly found in the intestinal tract but never associated with illness. They do not harm the body, even in people with weak immune systems. Symptomatic people who are found to have these protozoa in their stool should be examined for other causes of their symptoms.
Species
The nonpathogenic intestinal protozoa include:
Chilomastix mesnili
Endolimax nana
Entamoeba coli
Entamoeba dispar
Entamoeba hartmanni
Entamoeba polecki
Iodamoeba buetschlii
Symptoms
These nonpathogenic protozoa do not cause illness. Other possible causes of your symptoms should be considered. To see whether you are infected with a pathogen (a disease-causing agent), your healthcare provider might want to check your stool for bacteria, viruses, or other parasites. Another possibility is that your symptoms are not caused by an infection.
How it spreads
You get nonpathogenic intestinal protozoa by swallowing them. For example, by consuming food or water contaminated with feces. This is called fecal-oral transmission. The presence of these protozoa in your stool simply indicates that you had a fecal exposure sometime in the past.
They are found only in the lumen (cavity) of the intestinal tract. They are not found in the cells that line the intestine, and they do not spread to other parts of the body. They can stay in your intestines for weeks, months, or years.
Resource
DPDx - Nonpathogenic intestinal protozoa life cycle
Diagnosis
The presence of these harmless protozoa can be detected by microscopic examination of stool specimens.
Treatment
These protozoa are harmless, therefore there is no need for treatment.

Environmental sampling
Environmental sampling is a relatively new approach used to determine the level of workplace contamination by antineoplastic agents. The procedure has been used extensively in other situations, especially for monitoring contamination by radioactive materials. Typically, work surfaces are sampled with a moistened wipe and the material is extracted and analyzed for specific antineoplastic agents. Currently, it is possible to identify and quantitate six to eight agents with this technique.

Outdoor Workers
Insects and Scorpions at Work
KEY POINTS
Stinging or biting insects or scorpions can be hazardous to outdoor workers.
Stinging or biting insects include bees, wasps, hornets, and fire ants.
Employers and workers can take steps to prevent bites and stings.
Overview
A sting or bite from insects or scorpions can cause mild discomfort or pain. Workers allergic to the insect’s venom could die from anaphylactic shock. Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic reaction and requires immediate emergency care.
Prevention
It is important for employers to train their workers about:
Their risk of exposure to insects and scorpions.
How they can prevent and protect themselves from stings and bites.
What they should do if they are stung or bitten.
Allergic Reactions
Workers with a history of severe allergic reactions to insect bites or stings should carry an EpiPen and wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace.
Bees, wasps, and hornets
Bees, wasps, and hornets are most abundant in the warmer months. Nests and hives may be found in trees, under roof eaves, or on equipment such as ladders.
Bees, wasps, and hornets are found throughout the United States.
Worker protections
Wear light-colored, smooth-finished clothing.
Avoid perfumed soaps, shampoos, and deodorants.
Don't wear cologne or perfume.
Avoid bananas and banana-scented toiletries.
Wear clean clothing and bathe daily. Sweat may anger bees.
Wear clothing to cover as much of the body as possible.
Avoid flowering plants when possible.
Keep work areas clean. Social wasps thrive in places where humans discard food.
Remain calm and still if a single stinging insect is flying around. Swatting at an insect may cause it to sting.
If you are attacked by several stinging insects at once, run to get away from them. Bees release a chemical when they sting, which may attract other bees.
Go indoors.
A shaded area is better than an open area to get away from insects.
Do not jump into water since some insects will hover above water.
If a bee comes inside your vehicle, stop the car slowly, and open all the windows.
First aid
If a worker is stung by a bee, wasp, or hornet:
Have someone stay with them to see if they have an allergic reaction.
Wash the site with soap and water.
Remove the stinger.
Wipe gauze or scrape a fingernail over the area.
Never squeeze the stinger or use tweezers.
Apply ice to reduce swelling.
Do not scratch the sting.
Scratching may increase swelling, itching, and risk of infection.
Fire ants
Fire ants bite and sting. They are aggressive when stinging and inject venom, which causes a burning sensation. Red bumps form at the sting, and within a day or two they become white fluid-filled pustules.
Fire ants are mostly found in the Southeastern United States, with limited geographic distribution in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
Worker protections
Do not disturb or stand on or near ant mounds.
Be careful when lifting items (including animal carcasses) off the ground, as they may be covered in ants.
Fire ants may also be found on trees or in water, so always look over the area before starting to work.
First aid
If a worker is stung or bitten by fire ants:
Rub off ants briskly, as they will attach to the skin with their jaws.
Antihistamines may help.
Follow directions on the package.
Drowsiness may occur.
Take them to an emergency medical facility immediately if they have:
Severe chest pain
Nausea
Severe sweating
Loss of breath
Serious swelling
Slurred speech
Scorpions
Scorpions usually hide during the day and are active at night. They may be hiding under rocks, wood, or anything else lying on the ground. Some species may also burrow into the ground. Most scorpions live in dry, desert areas. However, some species can be found in grasslands, forests, and inside caves.
Scorpions are found in the Southern and Southwestern United States.
Symptoms
Symptoms of a scorpion sting may include:
Stinging or burning at the sting site (very little swelling or inflammation)
Positive ""tap test"" (extreme pain when the sting site is tapped with a finger)
Restlessness
Convulsions
Roving eyes
Staggering gait
Thick tongue sensation and/or slurred speech
Drooling
Muscle twitches
Abdominal pain and cramps
Trouble breathing
These symptoms usually subside within 48 hours, although stings from a bark scorpion can be life-threatening.
Worker protections
Wear long sleeves and pants.
Wear leather gloves.
Shake out clothing or shoes before putting them on.
First aid
If a worker is stung by a scorpion:
Contact a qualified health care provider or poison control center.
Apply ice, but do not submerge the affected area in ice water.
Remain relaxed and calm.
Do not take any sedatives.
Capture the scorpion for identification if it is safe to do so.

Lice
PARASITES 
About Head Lice
KEY POINTS
Head lice are parasitic insects that usually live on your scalp.
Symptoms include itching, tickling, or sores on your scalp.
Both prescription and over-the-counter medications treat head lice infestations.
Overview
Head lice, or Pediculus humanus capitis, are parasitic insects that feed on human blood. You can find them mostly on your head, but also on your eyebrows and eyelashes. Adult head lice are roughly 2 – 3 mm long (about the size of a sesame seed).
Both over-the-counter and prescription medications are available to treat head lice in your hair (infestation).
Symptoms
People with head lice may not have symptoms, particularly with a first infestation or when an infestation is light. Itching (pruritus) is the most common symptom of head lice infestation. It is caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites. It may take four to six weeks for itching to appear the first time a person has head lice.
Other symptoms may include the following:
A tickling feeling or a sensation of something moving in the hair
Irritability and sleeplessness
Sores on the head caused by scratching, which can sometimes become infected with bacteria normally found on your skin
Head lice do not transmit any disease and therefore are not considered a health hazard.
Who is at risk?
In the United States, infestation with head lice is most common among preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and caretakers.
There is not reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the United States; however, an estimated 6 – 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 – 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head lice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact.
In the United States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African American persons than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the United States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of some types of hair, but not others.
How it spreads
Head lice mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of a person infested with lice. Head lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or fly. Adult lice can live on a person's head for about 30 days. However, they will die within two days if they fall off a person and cannot feed. Adult female head lice are usually larger than males and can lay about six eggs each day. Nits (lice eggs) cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as those found close to the scalp. Nits take about a week (range 6 – 9 days) to hatch into nymphs (young lice). Nymphs look similar to adult lice but are very small (size of a pinhead); they take about seven days to mature into adult lice.
The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. This contact can be common among children playing at places like school or the home. Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of you or your environment.
Although not as common, head lice may spread by:
Wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person
Using infested combs, brushes, or towels
Lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with an infested person
Contracting lice from a wig or hairpiece is extremely unlikely. Especially if the wig or hairpiece hasn't been worn in the past 48 hours by a person with head lice.
Head lice can survive under water for several hours but are unlikely to spread in a swimming pool. Chlorine levels in pool water do not kill head lice.
Animals do not get or spread head lice.
Prevention
Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of head lice:
Avoid head-to-head (hair-to-hair) contact during play and other activities at home, school, and elsewhere (sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camp).
Do not share clothing such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, hair ribbons, or barrettes.
Do not share combs, brushes, or towels. Disinfest combs and brushes used by an infested person by soaking them in hot water (at least 130°F) for 5 – 10 minutes.
Do not lie on beds, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals that have recently been in contact with a person infested with head lice.
Machine wash and dry clothing, towels, bed linens, and other items that a person infested with lice wore or used during the two days before treatment. Use the hot water (130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. If you can't wash or dry clean items, seal them in a plastic bag and store them for two weeks.
Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where the infested person sat or lay. However, spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing.
Do not use fumigant sprays or fogs; they are not necessary to control head lice and can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
To help control a head lice outbreak in a community, school, or camp, teach children to avoid activities that may spread head lice. For example, teach children to
Avoid hair-to-hair contact during play.
Not to share clothing such as hats, hair ribbons, barrettes, scarves, coats, or sports uniforms.
Not to share combs, brushes, or towels.
Reminder
CDC's guidance has not changed—you do not need to send students with head lice infestation home early from school. They can go home at the end of the day, be treated, and return to class after beginning appropriate treatment. Nits may stay in hair after treatment, but successful treatment will kill crawling lice.
Diagnosis
Misdiagnosis of head lice infestation is common. Finding a live nymph (baby louse) or adult louse on the scalp or hair is the best way to diagnose a head lice infestation.
Because adult and nymph lice are very small, move quickly, and avoid light, they may be difficult to find. A fine-toothed louse comb may help you find lice.
If you do not see crawling lice, look for nits attached firmly within ¼ inch of the base of hair shafts. You will often see nits on hair behind the ears and near the back of the neck. Nits that are attached more than ¼ inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always hatched or dead.
Although head lice and nits can be visible with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or nits. Nits are often confused with other particles found in hair such as dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles.
If you do not see nymphs or adults, and the only nits found are more than ¼ inch from the scalp, then the infestation is probably old and does not need treatment.
How to Examine for Head Lice
If you are not sure if a person has head lice, see your healthcare provider.

The Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC)
About The Model Aquatic Health Code
KEY POINTS
CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is guidance to prevent injury and illness at aquatic venues open to the public.
This guidance brings together the latest science and best practices to help jurisdictions save time and resources when they develop and update pool codes, addressing topics like building aquatic facilities and lifeguard training.
Overview
CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is guidance to prevent injury and illness linked to aquatic venues — such as pools, hot tubs, and splash pads — open to the public. This guidance brings together the latest science and best practices to help jurisdictions save time and resources when they develop and update pool codes. Pool codes regulate how aquatic venues that are open to the public are designed, constructed, operated, and managed. These codes address topics such as how aquatic facilities are built, how lifeguards are trained and certified, and how chlorine levels in the water are tested.
The MAHC applies to aquatic venues open to the public. These venues can be operated by:
Hotels and motels
Apartment complexes
Homeowners' associations
Membership clubs (for example, gyms)
Schools
Waterparks
CDC works with the Council for the Model Aquatic Health Code (CMAHC)
to ensure the Model Aquatic Health Code stays current. The CMAHC regularly collects, assesses, and relays national input on needed MAHC revisions.
The 2023 MAHC provides guidance for public aquatic venues to help prevent injury and illness.
Why it's important
The primary objective of the MAHC is to prevent injuries and illnesses at pools, hot tubs, and splash pads open to the public, including:
Drowning
More children ages 1–4 die from drowning than any other cause of death. For children ages 5–14, drowning is the second leading cause of death from unintentional injury after motor vehicle crashes.
Pool chemical injuries
Pool chemical injuries account for about 4,500 emergency department visits each year. At least one third of the patients are under 18 years old.
Disease outbreaks linked to swimming
Over 200 disease outbreaks linked to pools, hot tubs, and splash pads occurred during 2015–2019. The leading cause of these outbreaks was Cryptosporidium. This parasite is very chlorine tolerant and can cause outbreaks that can sicken hundreds or even thousands of people.
Public pool and hot tub/spa closings because of public health hazards
One out of eight routine public pool inspections and one out of seven routine public hot tub or spa inspections result in immediate closure because of at least one violation representing a serious threat to public health.
Background
Most health departments and related agencies have programs to help ensure swimmers and aquatics staff stay safe and healthy. Previously, each individual agency had to do its own research to develop or update pool codes because no single science-based reference existed at the national level. This means pool codes can greatly vary across the United States.
CDC created the MAHC at the request of health departments and the aquatics sector to provide scientifically based guidance at the national level. The first edition of the MAHC was released in 2014 and it has been updated every few years since then. The MAHC helps jurisdictions save the time and resources previously used to develop and update their codes themselves.
Policy
The MAHC is not a federal law. The MAHC is a CDC guidance document and only becomes law if voluntarily adopted by a local, state, territorial, or tribal jurisdiction. This means jurisdictions can:
Choose to adopt all of it or parts of it
Modify part or all of it to fit their needs
Use it as a reference
Aquatics sector leaders can also work with health departments to use the MAHC to make swimming and other water activities safer and healthier, even if the jurisdiction has not yet adopted the MAHC.

Accreditation: National Voluntary Program
WHAT TO KNOW
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supports the implementation of a national voluntary accreditation program for state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments.
Overview
The Public Health Accreditation Board
(PHAB), a nonprofit 501(c)3 entity, serves as the independent accrediting body. PHAB led the development and testing activities, with significant participation from local, tribal, state, and national leaders and launched the national voluntary accreditation program on September 14, 2011. PHAB began accrediting health departments in 2013.

Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality
AT A GLANCE
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protects privacy and confidentiality in accordance with federal laws.
CDC uses Certificates of Confidentiality and other resources to protect identifiable and potentially identifiable information.
Overview
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commits to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information we have, in accordance with federal laws. The Privacy and Confidentiality Unit (PCU) provides guidance on privacy and confidentiality for all federally funded and supported activities through consultation and issuance of Assurances of Confidentiality to CDC programs.
Privacy
CDC provides technical support and education to CDC employees; grantees; partners; and state, Tribal, and local health departments on:
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
Other federal privacy laws.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
The HIPAA Privacy Rule
(45 CFR Parts 160
and 164
) regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, called protected health information (PHI), by covered entities. The Privacy Rule protects all PHI transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g. electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity or its business associates. It excludes certain educational and employment records.
The Privacy Rule gives individuals certain rights in respect to their health information including, but not limited to, the right to inspect and request corrections or amendments to their PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of their privacy rights and how their PHI will be used and disclosed.
The Privacy Rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without the written authorization from the individual; however, there are several exceptions to this requirement including disclosures
for public health activities.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g
; 34 CFR Part 99
) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Health care information is generally part of the education record. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.
FERPA gives parents certain rights regarding their child's education record. These rights include the right to inspect and request corrections to the record. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.
FERPA generally prohibits the disclosure of any personally identifiable information contained in an education record without the appropriate written consent. FERPA offers limited exceptions to this requirement.
Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality (CoCs) protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable and potentially identifiable research information, with limited exceptions.
Any investigator or institution issued a CoC shall not:
Disclose or provide covered information, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding.
Disclose or provide covered information to any other person not connected with the research.
CDC investigators with a CoC may ONLY disclose identifiable and potentially identifiable information in the following circumstances:
If required by other federal, state, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases.
If the subject consents.
For the purposes of scientific research that is compliant with human subjects' regulations.
CoCs cover any CDC-funded research project collecting or using identifiable and potentially identifiable information, in compliance with Section 301(d)
of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). All CDC-funded research activities are automatically issued a CoC through their award. No physical certificate will be issued. The CoC will apply as a term and condition of award. This applies to:
Grants.
Cooperative Agreements.
Contracts.
CDC-sponsored intramural research.
For research activities enrolling human participants, CDC requires investigators to inform participants of the CoC protections and the limits to those protections.
Assurance of Confidentiality
An Assurance of Confidentiality (AoC) is a formal confidentiality protection authorized under Section 308(d)
of the PHSA. CDC investigators use it to collect or maintain sensitive identifiable information from individuals and institutions. The law states that no identifiable information may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied. The exception is if such institution or individual consented to that disclosure. Protected information includes identifiable information on institutions or individuals who are the subjects of non-research, public health activities with an approved AoC.
CDC implements agency AoC protection for public health activities conducted by CDC investigators that involve the collection or maintenance of identifiable information. This protection allows CDC programs to assure individuals and institutions involved in non-research activities (e.g., surveillance) that those conducting the activity will protect the confidentiality of the identifiable data collected.
Disclosures can be made without individual authorization only for purposes stated at the time of data collection or specifically consented to thereafter by each of the parties provided the promise of confidentiality.

Global Health
Global Health Security
KEY POINTS
Global health security is national security. CDC's global staff are part of the first line of defense to stop outbreaks where they start.
Global health security means being able to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats globally.
CDC works to protect the health, safety, and security of the American people and fight global health threats worldwide.
Overview
CDC supports training workers, improving diagnostics and specimen transport systems, and strengthening health systems to quickly stop outbreaks before they spread.
Global health security is the existence of strong and resilient public health systems that can prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, wherever they occur in the world. In today's interconnected world, a disease threat anywhere is a threat everywhere – and outbreaks can disrupt American lives and livelihoods even if they never reach America's shores.
As the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks have demonstrated, diseases can cross borders, disrupt societies, and threaten global stability. Strengthening global health security is a vital national security priority, and is essential to protecting the health, lives, and economic well-being of the American people.
As the United States' health protection agency, CDC works 24/7 to save lives and protect people from health threats.
Core capabilities further our mission
CDC is a critical part of the U.S. government-wide effort to promote global health security. CDC works with countries around the world to detect and respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks and stop them at their source to prevent further spread.
No matter the threat, we know we can protect the health of Americans and people around the world by strengthening six core public health capabilities:
Data and surveillance
Laboratory
Workforce and institutions
Prevention and response
Innovation and research
Policy, communications, and diplomacy
How we do it
CDC's Global Health Strategic Framework is a bridge that connects all of CDC's global health activities. Learn how we use it to measure progress and impact, and guide informed decision-making for global health activities across CDC.
CDC's Global Health Strategic Framework
Longstanding expertise
CDC has over 60 country and regional offices that implement our global health programming, which addresses hundreds of diseases, health threats, and conditions that are major causes of death, disease, and disability. CDC's decades-long global health investments, training, and scientific diplomacy strengthen global capacity in laboratories, data, emergency response and the public health workforce. Thanks to extensive global presence and decades-long trusted partnerships, CDC's global staff are often the first call by host country governments when disease outbreaks start.
Collaborative efforts
Building global health security can't be accomplished alone. CDC assistance to partner countries has resulted in substantial improvements to their readiness to fight infectious disease threats. To accomplish global health security goals, CDC works closely with other U.S. government agencies, ministries of health, international organizations, and in-country partners.
U.S. Global Health Security Strategy
The United States and the international community can only achieve global, sustainable health security by working with all countries. The U.S. Government released the 2024 Global Health Security Strategy (GHSS)
outlining U.S. efforts to prevent and prepare for the next pandemic, and to protect Americans and people around the globe from health security threats. CDC has long supported partner governments to address critical, immediate health needs and strengthen their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to emerging health threats.
Global Health Security Agenda
The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA)
aims to strengthen the world’s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. More than 70 countries have signed onto the GHSA framework. The United States made a strong commitment to the initial five-year period of GHSA and continues to support its strategic priorities. GHSA 2024's targets are for countries to take greater ownership of global health security efforts and improve health-security-related technical areas.
Joint External Evaluation
To measure countries' progress towards meeting GHSA goals, CDC and its partners developed the Joint External Evaluation (JEE). The JEE is a voluntary evaluation process that gives countries a starting point for improving their health security. Countries can use the JEE to identify their strengths and point out the most urgent needs within their health systems. This transparent, external evaluation process encourages countries to exchange vital information and work together towards a safer, healthier world.

Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)
WHAT TO KNOW
Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes. They are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, worship, and age. These conditions include a wide set of forces and systems that shape daily life such as economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies, and political systems. CDC has adapted this definition from the World Health Organization.
Why are SDOH important to CDC?
SDOH are one of three priority areas for Healthy People 2030
, along with health equity and health literacy. Healthy People 2030 sets data-driven national objectives in five key areas of SDOH
: healthcare access and quality, education access and quality, social and community context, economic stability, and neighborhood and built environment. Some examples of SDOH included in Healthy People 2030 are safe housing, transportation, and neighborhoods; polluted air and water; and access to nutritious foods and physical health opportunities.
As the federal government's leading public health agency, CDC has a unique role in contributing to work on SDOH.
Why is addressing SDOH important for CDC and public health?
Addressing differences in SDOH accelerates progress toward health equity, a state in which every person has the opportunity to attain their highest level of health. SDOH have been shown to have a greater influence on health than either genetic factors or access to healthcare services. For example, poverty is highly correlated with poorer health outcomes and higher risk of premature death.A SDOH, including the effects of centuries of racism, are key drivers of health inequities within communities of color. The impact is pervasive and deeply embedded in our society, creating inequities in access to a range of social and economic benefits—such as housing, education, wealth, and employment. These inequities put people at higher risk of poor health.
CDC is coordinating efforts to focus its resources on the areas where federal public health investments can make the most difference. For example, CDC's Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) focuses on reducing high rates of chronic diseases for specific racial and ethnic groups in urban, rural, and tribal communities. Since 1999, the program has worked across sectors in racial and ethnic minority communities to reduce tobacco use, improve access to healthy foods, change the built environment to promote physical activity, and connect people to clinical care.
Public health actions that affect SDOH
Public health organizations can:
Convene
Bring together community members and organizations to identify local concerns.
CDC has a long history of convening partners through national conferences, webinars, collaborative publications, and guideline development. CDC also encourages other public health organizations to act as conveners by including coalition-building or community engagement activities as a requirement in some funded projects.
Integrate
Collect and use multiple sources of data, including public health data, to help develop strategies for set direction. For example, public health departments can provide GIS maps of community needs and assets based on CDC PLACES dataB and environmental justice dataC.
Influence
Lead approaches to develop policies and solutions or leverage funding through various mechanisms to implement and expand priority actions. For example, when CDC Director Rochelle Walensky announced that racism is a public health threat in 2021, it reinforced actions that communities were already taking and supported many others as they took subsequent actions.
Contribute to big changes
Collaborate with others to find innovative solutions and put them into place. For example, an LA County public health initiative
resulted in the ban of menthol cigarettes.

General process for guideline development
1. Workgroup.
A workgroup is formed and meets for an extended period (e.g., months or years) to gather, examine, and interpret data.
2. Data.
The workgroup presents data and expert opinion to the full HICPAC membership for review and discussion. The full committee (not the workgroup) is charged with making recommendations to CDC.
3. First draft.
The first draft of new or revised guidelines is presented and discussed. If ready, the HICPAC members will vote on if the draft guidelines are ready for CDC review and public comment. Members weigh public discussion and the presented data.
4. Public comment.
If voting members approve, the guidelines are reviewed by CDC and then posted to the Federal Register for public comment, including industry input.
5. Review & revision.
CDC and HICPAC review and respond to the public comments. The guidelines are revised to reflect public input. CDC reviews again.
6. Vote & recommendation.
The workgroup presents the revised and pre-final draft for HICPAC approval. The members vote on the guideline and, if approved, recommend the final draft to CDC. Once guidelines are approved by HICPAC and complete a final CDC review, the CDC infection control website and related materials are updated.
Charter
The committee is governed by the provisions of Public Law 92-463, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), which sets forth standards for the formation and use of advisory committees.

Self-Care for Arthritis: Five Ways to Manage Your Symptoms
KEY POINTS
There are many things you can do to manage arthritis symptoms.
The things you do to manage your condition and stay healthy are called ""self-management"" or ""self-care.""
Here are five of the most effective things you can do—without medicine—to control arthritis pain and symptoms.
Why it matters
Managing arthritis can help relieve your symptoms so you can do the activities that are important to you. It can also help you manage other chronic conditions you may have, such as diabetes, heart disease, or obesity.
Things you can do right away
Follow these five key steps to manage your arthritis:
1. Learn the skills you need to manage arthritis
Learn the skills you need and gain confidence to manage your condition.
There are low-cost self-management education workshops (about $25–$35) across the country.
These workshops can help you learn to manage pain, exercise safely, and gain control of your arthritis.
2. Be active
Research shows physical activity for arthritis:
Reduces pain.
Improves physical function.
Delays physical limitations that can be caused by arthritis.
All adults, including those with arthritis, should try to get at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) each week of moderate physical activity, such as fast walking or bicycling.
Meeting the recommended guidelines
You can make it easier to get the recommended (150 minutes a week of) physical activity by:
Choosing activities that you enjoy.
Breaking it up into small chunks—for example, 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.
Taking personal or group exercise programs.
If you are not able to meet the recommendation, be as active as you can. Even small amounts of physical activity can have some health benefits.
Learn about CDC-recognized physical activity programs for people with arthritis.
Get started on Walk With Ease
Walk With Ease is a CDC-recognized program that can help you increase your physical activity safely and comfortably. Register for a free copy of the guidebook (for U.S. residents) to get started at your own pace.
3. Keep a healthy weight
Keeping a healthy weight can help slow arthritis symptoms from getting worse so you can keep doing the activities you enjoy.
For adults who have overweight or obesity, even a small amount of weight loss can help reduce arthritis-related pain and disability.
Even a 5%, or 12-pound loss, for a 250-pound person can help.
Eating a healthy diet can relieve joint pressure.
4. See your health care provider
If you have arthritis (especially inflammatory arthritis), it is important that a health care provider detect it early.
Health care providers can recommend physical activity and other ways to manage arthritis without medicine so you can maintain a good quality of life.
If medicines are needed to help you cope with symptoms, health care providers can prescribe them.
This may be the case with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritis conditions.
Talk to a health care provider about your pain and symptoms.
5. Protect your joints
Avoiding injuries to joints can reduce the chances of getting osteoarthritis or making it worse.
Doing sports or jobs that have repetitive motions, such as repeated knee bending, put people at higher risk for this type of arthritis.
Check out these resources for tips on how to prevent joint injuries at work, in sports, and from falls:
Prevent osteoarthritis through weight management, sports injury prevention, and falls prevention

The Healthy People initiative is designed to guide national health promotion and disease prevention efforts to improve the health of the nation. Released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) every decade since 1980, Healthy People identifies science-based objectives with targets to monitor progress and motivate and focus action. Healthy People has established benchmarks in order to:
Identify nationwide health improvement priorities.
Increase public awareness and understanding of the determinants of health, disease, and disability and the opportunities for progress.
Provide measurable objectives and goals that are applicable at the national, State, and local levels.
Engage multiple sectors to take actions to strengthen policies and improve practices that are driven by the best available evidence and knowledge.
Identify critical research, evaluation, and data collection needs.
Healthy People 2030 is the fifth iteration of the initiative and continues in this tradition with about 350 core objectives to be tracked over the decade.

Heart Disease
About Work-related Heart Disease
KEY POINTS
A person's job can increase their risk of heart disease.
There are multiple work-related risk factors for heart disease.
Some jobs have a higher risk for heart disease.
There are things employers and employees can do to reduce heart disease.
Overview
Heart disease refers to health conditions that involve the heart or blood vessels.
One factor that can cause heart disease is exposure to certain social, organizational, and environmental conditions at work.
Some jobs can increase your risk for heart disease.

Heat Stress
Heat Stress and Workers
KEY POINTS
Outdoor and indoor workers exposed to extreme heat or work in hot environments may experience occupational heat stress and be at risk for a heat-related illness.
Occupational heat stress is the combination of metabolic heat, environmental heat, and clothing and personal protective equipment (PPE), which results in increased heat storage within the body.
Heat stress can lead to heat-related illnesses and physical injuries.
Overview
Workers who are exposed to extreme heat or work in hot environments may experience occupational heat stress. Occupational heat stress is the combination of metabolic heat, environmental heat, and clothing and personal protective equipment (PPE), which results in increased heat storage within the body. Exposure to extreme heat can result in occupational illnesses and injuries.
Heat stress can result in heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, heat exhaustion, rhabdomyolysis, heat cramps, and heat rashes.
Heat can also cause physical injuries such as:
incidents from sweaty palms or slipping on a sweat puddle on the floor
visual impairment from fogged up safety glasses may be a concern
touching hot equipment could result in burns
dizziness and fatigue may cause neglect resulting in injuries
PPE loosened or removed due to heat may lead to additional exposures
Who is at increased risk
Workers at risk of experiencing heat stress include outdoor and indoor workers in hot environments.
Risk factors for heat-related illnesses include:
high temperature and humidity
direct sun exposure
indoor radiant heat sources
limited air movement
lack of acclimatization
dehydration (not drinking enough fluids)
physical exertion
personal protective equipment (PPE) and clothing
physical condition and health problems
certain medications
advanced age
pregnancy
previous heat-related illness
Prevention
Prevention of heat stress in workers is important. Employers should reduce workplace heat stress by using engineering and administrative (work practice) controls. Employers should provide training to workers so they understand what heat stress is, how it affects their health and safety, and how it can be prevented.
Dialysis Safety
Infections and Patients on Dialysis
KEY POINTS
If you are a patient on dialysis, you are at risk for infections.
Each dialysis treatment option has varying risks for infection.
You can take steps to help prevent infections while receiving dialysis.
Overview
Your kidneys play a vital role in cleaning your blood, eliminating waste from your body, and supporting other important functions. Dialysis is a medical treatment for kidney failure or kidneys that do not work right. It is not a cure to restore kidney function.
Infections are common among people receiving dialysis and can be very serious.
Everyone has a role to play in preventing infections and improving dialysis patient safety. You can be a safe patient and take action to help prevent infections.
Dialysis treatment options
In-center hemodialysis
Home hemodialysis
Peritoneal dialysis (PD)
Each treatment option has varying risks for infection. Discuss treatment options with your doctor to decide which is best based on your needs.
Infection risk and terms to know
Vein access: also known as vascular access, moves blood between your body and the dialysis machine during hemodialysis treatments.
Arteriovenous (AV) fistula: access to the bloodstream created when doctors surgically join an artery and a vein, often in the arm. Once healed, hemodialysis takes place through the fistula. This access type lasts longer than a graft and has the lowest risk of infection.
Arteriovenous (AV) graft: access to the bloodstream created when doctors put in a tube that connects an artery and vein. This access type has a higher risk of infection than an AV fistula, but lower than a central line catheter.
Central line catheter: access to the bloodstream created by inserting a tube through the skin into a vein. The tube enters through a vein in the neck, chest, or groin and the tip of the tube ends near the heart. This access type is for short-term use and quick placement, and also has the highest risk of infection.
Healthcare providers may use a central line catheter if treatment needs to begin soon, you have damaged veins and arteries or you experience barriers to other types of vein access.
View LargerDownload
Reducing the use of central venous catheters for people on dialysis can help prevent bloodstream infections.
How germs spread
When someone is sick with a respiratory infection in a dialysis facility, you can breathe in respiratory droplets after a sick person coughs or sneezes. Germs can also spread through contact with contaminated equipment surfaces, through unclean hands or through vein access points when proper infection control processes are not used.
Steps to take
Keep your hands clean and cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.
Learn about the dialysis process: know what to expect during treatment and things healthcare staff do to protect you from infections.
Watch the CDC's Speak Up video for questions to ask during your dialysis treatments.
Check your access daily and notify staff if you notice any of these signs of infection:
Redness
Pus or unusual drainage
Swelling
Notify staff if your catheter bandage gets dirty or wet.
Ask staff if you can use a fistula or graft for treatment if you have a central line catheter.
Make sure all staff clean their hands before and after caring for you or your access.
In some cases, you may need to take extra actions to prevent infections. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Possible infections
Bloodstream infections (BSIs), most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (staph).
Some types of staph may be resistant to antibiotics, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Chronic viral infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV.
Intestinal and respiratory infections such as C.diff. (Clostridioides difficile) and Flu (Influenza).
Resources
CDC has posters and fact sheets to help patients prevent infections while receiving dialysis.

E. coli Infection (Escherichia coli)
Signs of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
KEY POINTS
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is very serious complication of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection.
It can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems, and even death.
Seek medical care immediately if you notice signs of HUS.
What to look out for
Signs that someone with diarrhea may be developing HUS include:
Urinating (peeing) less often or not at all
Losing pink color in cheeks and inside the lower eyelids
Unexplained bruising or tiny red spots on the skin
Having blood in the urine (pee)
Feeling very tired or irritable (cranky)
Decreased awareness (alertness)
When to seek emergency help
HUS is a medical emergency.
Call the doctor or go to the emergency room immediately.
People with HUS should be hospitalized because their kidneys may stop working and they may develop other serious problems. Most people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent health problems or die.
Other information about HUS
People at risk for HUS
Anyone can develop HUS.
However, among people with diarrhea, HUS is most common among children younger than 5 years.
Causes of HUS
HUS is most often caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection. About 8 in 10 children with HUS have STEC infection.
Other important causes of HUS are
Other germs that cause diarrhea, vomiting, or intestinal symptoms
Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria
Some medications, including some chemotherapy drugs

Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs)
WHAT TO KNOW
Hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) provide specialized health care for people who have bleeding disorders. Use the HTC Directory to find where HTCs are located across the US.
Overview
Hemophilia is a complex disorder that can lead to chronic health problems such as joint disease over time. However, if the disorder is managed properly, people with hemophilia can live long, healthy lives. Good quality medical care from doctors and nurses who know a lot about the disorder can help prevent some serious problems. This type of specialty care can be found at a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center (HTC).
HTCs are specialized healthcare centers that bring together a team of doctors, nurses, and other health professionals experienced in treating people with hemophilia.1
Find an HTC Near You
Find an HTC near you with the HTC Directory. You can also search for the names and contact information of hemophilia treatment centers and staff, create and save lists, print mailing labels, and send emails.
HTC Directory
The comprehensive care model
Each HTC provides access to multidisciplinary healthcare professionals:
Lab medical technologists and pathologists
Hematologists (doctors who specialize in blood)
Orthopedists (doctors who specialize in bones, joints, and muscles)
Physical therapists
Nurses
Social workers and other mental health professionals
Other specialists available by referral (for example, dentist, nutritionist, genetic counselor)
Comprehensive HTCs emphasize prevention services to help reduce or eliminate complications. These services include using preventive medicine and connecting patients with community groups that provide education and support to families. For example, the National Bleeding Disorders Foundation partners with HTCs and CDC to educate people with this disorder about the top five ways to reduce complications
.
HTC staff specialize in caring for people with bleeding disorders.
Advancing knowledge and impacting practice
One of the major challenges facing researchers and scientists who work on rare disorders such as hemophilia is lack of access to uniform data. Federally funded HTCs throughout the United States can participate in CDC's Community Counts program, which collects a consistent set of data to monitor the health of people with hemophilia. The data are used to advance knowledge and eventually impact health practices for this condition and other related disorders.
Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs)
About Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers
AT A GLANCE
Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of diseases that are caused by several distinct families of viruses.
The term ""viral hemorrhagic fever"" refers to a condition where many of the body's organ systems are affected, the overall cardiovascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to function on its own is reduced.
In addition to VHFs, there are serious infectious diseases like Nipah and Hendra diseases that also require a specialized laboratory, are highly pathogenic, and have no, or limited, vaccine or treatment currently available.
VHFs, Nipah and Hendra disease can cause relatively mild illness or more life-threatening disease. Symptoms can vary but may include bleeding or hemorrhaging. Distribution of these viruses is determined by where the animals that naturally carry them live.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Types
Most VHFs fall into one of four families of virus:
Arenaviruses
Each arenavirus has one or a few closely related rodents that carry the virus without getting sick themselves. This is known as the reservoir, or source of the virus in nature. The reservoir can spread the virus to people through infected urine, saliva, or droppings, and can cause severe disease in people.
People are infected with arenaviruses by:
Touching with rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials from an infected rodent
Breathing in air contaminated by rodent urine, droppings or nesting materials.
Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent.
Eating food contaminated by urine, droppings, or saliva from an infected rodent.
Contact with another person who has certain arenaviruses, such as Chapare, Lassa, Machupo, and Lujo viruses.
Bunyavirales order
Viruses in the Bunyavirales order are spread by rodents or insects, such as mosquitos, ticks, or sand flies. They can produce mild to severe disease in animals and people. Many of these viruses cannot spread between people. However, person-to-person spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has occurred in healthcare settings where infection control was limited.
Filoviruses
Filoviruses can cause severe illness in people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and gorillas). The Egyptian rousette bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is a cave-dwelling bat, and the reservoir for Marburg virus. Bats infected with orthomarburgviruses do not show obvious signs of illness. It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that bats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they can spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Caretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection.
Flaviviruses
Flaviviruses, are found throughout the world. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to severe disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large economic and social impact on people living in affected areas.
Paramyxoviruses
Paramyxoviruses can cause sudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within the Paramyxoviridae family, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because they require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.

Paramyxoviruses Hendra virus 9-16 days Australia Flying fox bat (genus Pteropus)
Paramyxoviruses Nipah virus 5-14 days Bangladesh, India Flying fox bat (genus Pteropus)
Prevention
Prevention of VHFs and other HCIDs depends on the host reservoir and how the virus spreads. Prevention measures can target reservoir exclusion activities (for example, use of insect repellents, bed nets, and protective clothing and disinfection procedures while caring for a sick person) or by sealing up and setting traps in homes and other buildings when a rodent infestation is discovered.

Hendra Virus Disease
About Hendra Disease
AT A GLANCE
Hendra disease is an extremely rare illness caused by the Hendra virus and has been reported in people and horses.
Horses get sick with Hendra disease after contact with Australian flying fox bats or their fluids.
People have been infected after contact with infected horses.
There have only been seven cases reported in humans.
Prevent infection with Hendra virus by avoiding sick horses.
What it is
Hendra virus was first identified during a 1994 outbreak of lung and brain disease in horses and people in Hendra, Australia. The virus is part of the same virus family (Paramyxoviruses) as Nipah virus.
Pteropus bats, or ""flying fox"" bats, are the animal that maintains Hendra virus in nature. The virus has been found in all four species of Australian flying foxes.
Flying foxes can infect horses with the virus when they bite the horses. Horses can also be infected if they are exposed to the urine, droppings, or saliva of an infected bat. Spread from flying foxes to horses is limited to coastal and forested regions in Australia (Queensland and New South Wales states). Horses can then spread the virus to people.
Hendra infections in people remain rare; only seven cases have ever been reported.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms in people typically begin 9-16 days after they had contact with an infected horse. Hendra infection can cause lung problems with severe flu-like symptoms. In some cases, illness may progress to brain swelling (encephalitis).
Hendra infections are rare. However, it leads to death in more than half of people who get it (57 percent).
Exposure risks
People at highest risk are
Those living in areas with Australian flying foxes
Those in contact with horses potentially exposed to flying foxes
See where Pteropus bats live
See where Pteropus bats and Nipah outbreaks are found.
About Nipah Virus
How it spreads
Hendra virus can spread to people after contact with tissues or excretions of infected horses, like blood, urine, or birthing materials.
Horses may be infected after exposure to virus in the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected flying foxes. Infected bat urine or droppings can fall directly on the horse or in the food or water they're consuming.
To date, no spread between people has been documented.
Prevention
Hendra infection in people has only been linked to infection of an a ""middleman"" animal, or intermediate host, like horses. Early detection of infections in horses is an important way limiting future Hendra infections in people.
People in areas with Hendra virus or flying foxes can prevent illness with Hendra virus by:
Avoiding sick horses
Avoiding horses that may be infected with Hendra virus
If someone must have contact with an infected horse, they should use personal protective equipment, like boots, gloves, protective eyewear, mask or respirator, and gown.
There is a commercial vaccine licensed in Australia for horses. This could be beneficial for other animal species that may be at risk for Hendra infection and eventually people.
Testing
Laboratory tests can diagnose Hendra infection. These tests include detection of antibody by ELISA (IgG and IgM), real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and virus isolation attempts. The same tests can detect Nipah virus.
In most countries, Hendra virus should be handled in high- containment laboratories.
Hendra or Nipah virus infection can be diagnosed during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease. This can be done with a combination of tests including
Detection of antibody in the serum or the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
Viral RNA detection (RT-PCR) in the serum, CSF, or throat swabs, and
Virus isolation from the CSF or throat swabs.
Treatment
The drug ribavirin has been shown effective against Hendra and Nipah viruses in laboratory studies. However, it's not clear how much help it would be in patients sick with Hendra infection.
An antibody drug that prevents Hendra and Nipah infection in people is in development in Australia. If it reaches final development, the therapy would be given to people who were exposed to Hendra virus and became sick.
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A Vaccine
KEY POINTS
Hepatitis A is preventable by safe and effective vaccines.
Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself against hepatitis A.
Recommendations at a glance
Children
All children 12–23 months old as part of routine childhood vaccination.
All children and adolescents 2–18 years old who have not previously received hepatitis A vaccine.
People at increased risk for hepatitis A
Some people are at higher risk for hepatitis A and should prioritize getting vaccinated. These people include:
International travelers.
Men who have sex with men.
People who use or inject drugs.
People whose jobs increase the risk of exposure.
People who anticipate close personal contact with an international adoptee.
People experiencing homelessness.
People at risk for serious disease
Some populations have a higher risk for serious disease from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and should consider vaccination. These people include:
People with chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Pregnant women.
International travelers
There are some countries and regions where hepatitis A is more common, and travelers can be infected even if they regularly wash their hands.
If you're planning to travel internationally, talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated against hepatitis A.
You should plan to get vaccinated as early as possible, but even late vaccination can have some impact. If you can't get hepatitis A vaccine or if you're at a higher risk for disease, your doctor might recommend immune globulin to protect you for up to 2 months.
For full protection, you will need two or three shots, depending on the type of vaccine.
You can visit the CDC Traveler's Health Yellow Book for more information.
Who should not get the vaccine
If you have had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine or are allergic to any of the ingredients of the vaccine, you should not get vaccinated. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.
Are you a health care provider?
To find information for clinicians on vaccine administration, see Hepatitis A Vaccine Administration.
Vaccine Administration
Why vaccination is important
Cases of hepatitis A have declined significantly since the vaccine was first recommended. However, recently there have been many hepatitis A outbreaks.
What the vaccine protects against
Hepatitis A vaccines only protect against hepatitis A. There are separate vaccines for hepatitis B only, as well as a combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine that protects against both viruses. There is currently no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Getting vaccinated after exposure
Immune globulin is made from human blood plasma and has antibodies — the body’s natural defense against infection. While they don’t provide long-term protection like vaccines, immune globulin injections can help fight infection in certain cases.
Preventing hepatitis A with good hygiene
The hepatitis A vaccine is the best way to prevent infection. Washing your hands often — especially after using the bathroom, after changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food — can also prevent the spread of hepatitis A.
What to expect
There are two types of hepatitis A vaccines: single-antigen and combination. The single-antigen vaccine protects against hepatitis A and the combination vaccine protects against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. You can only receive the combination vaccine if you’re 18 years or older. Make sure to get the full vaccine dosing for long-term protection.
Vaccine 
Number of shots needed 
Dosage timeline 
 Hepatitis A single-antigen 
2
Shots must be at least 6 months apart
Combination: Hepatitis A and hepatitis B
(Must be 18 years of age or older) 
3
All shots are given over the course of 6 months
In case of a delayed dose
While staying on schedule is important, delays can happen. If your first dose was more than 6 months ago, you should get your second dose as soon as possible. You do not need to get the first dose again.
Safety and effectiveness
Both types of hepatitis A vaccine are safe and highly effective, even for people with compromised immune systems. As with any medicine, there is a small risk that a serious problem could occur after getting vaccinated.
The potential risks of hepatitis A are much higher than any risks associated with hepatitis A vaccine. Millions of doses of hepatitis A vaccine have been given since the first hepatitis A vaccine was licensed in 1995.
Extra doses of the vaccine
If you or a loved one can’t find vaccination records, your doctor may recommend revaccination for hepatitis A. Extra doses of hepatitis A vaccine are not harmful.
Possible side effects
There are no serious side effects from hepatitis A vaccines. The most common side effect is soreness in the area around the shot site.
Available vaccines
There are several hepatitis A vaccines available in the United States, including:
HAVRIX®
VAQTA®
TWINRIX®
Talk to your doctor to determine which vaccine is right for you.
Where to get the vaccine
There are several places to get hepatitis A vaccine for free or at a low cost. Talk to your doctor or local public health department to learn more. For children, check the CDC's Vaccines for Children Program.
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B Vaccine
WHAT TO KNOW
The best way to prevent hepatitis B is by getting vaccinated.

Hepatitis B vaccine is a series of two or three shots depending on the vaccine brand.
Missing a dose
If you miss a dose of hepatitis B vaccine, it's okay. Be sure to get the next dose as soon as possible.
Pregnancy considerations
Hepatitis B vaccine is safe for pregnant women. Talk to your doctor about the best option for you.
Boosters are often not necessary
A ""booster"" dose is an extra dose of vaccine that can increase or extend the effectiveness of the vaccine. Most healthy people do not need a booster dose.
What to expect
If you get the three-shot series, your doctor will give them over a 6-month period. If you get the vaccine that is two doses, you will get them about one month apart. You need to get all of the shots to be fully protected.
Safety and effectiveness
Hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. It gives you long-term protection against illness from acute and chronic infection.
Possible side effects
Hepatitis B vaccine is safe, and most people don’t experience any side effects. Soreness at the injection site is the most common side effect.
Available vaccines
There are several types of hepatitis B vaccines available in the United States. Talk to your doctor to determine which vaccine is right for you.
Where to get the vaccine
Hepatitis B vaccine is available now. Talk to your doctor to get vaccinated.

Hereditary Hemochromatosis
About Hereditary Hemochromatosis
KEY POINTS
Hemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body and can cause severe liver disease and other health problems.
Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent complications from the disease.
If you have a family health history of hemochromatosis, talk to your healthcare provider about testing for hereditary hemochromatosis.
What it is
Hemochromatosis is a disorder in which the body can build up too much iron (called iron overload) in the skin, heart, liver, pancreas, pituitary gland, and joints. Too much iron is toxic to the body, and over time the high levels of iron can damage tissues and organs and lead to
Cirrhosis (liver damage)
Hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer)
Heart problems
Arthritis (joint pain)
Diabetes
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of hemochromatosis include
Feeling tired or weak
Weight loss
Joint pain
Bronze or grey skin color
Abdominal pain
Loss of sex drive
Many people with hereditary hemochromatosis don't know they have it. Early symptoms of hemochromatosis, such as feeling tired or weak, are common and can also be symptoms of a variety of other diseases.
People at risk
Hereditary hemochromatosis is most common among people with Northern European ancestry. Men with hereditary hemochromatosis are more likely to develop complications than women, and men are often diagnosed at an earlier age.
Causes
Hereditary hemochromatosis is most commonly caused by certain changes in a specific gene, called the HFE gene. If you inherit two of these genetic changes (mutations), one from each parent, you have hereditary hemochromatosis and are at risk for developing high iron levels. However, most people with hereditary hemochromatosis never develop symptoms or complications. If you have a family member, especially a sibling, who is known to have hereditary hemochromatosis, talk to your healthcare provider about genetic testing.
Diagnosis
A blood test can be used to screen people who may have hemochromatosis by measuring how much iron is in their blood. Affected people with or without a known family history of hemochromatosis can be diagnosed through blood tests for excess iron in the body (called iron overload) followed by genetic testing. The earlier hemochromatosis is diagnosed, the less likely you are to develop serious complications—many of which can cause permanent problems.
Treatment
If you have hemochromatosis, your healthcare provider may suggest ways to lower the amount of iron in your body.
If you are diagnosed with hemochromatosis, regularly scheduled blood removal is the most effective way to lower the amount of iron in your body.
Your healthcare provider may also recommend
Annual blood tests to check your iron levels
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to check for cirrhosis, permanent scarring that damages your liver and prevents it from working properly
Iron chelation therapy, if you cannot have blood removed. This involves medicine taken either orally or injected to lower the amount of iron in your body.
Dietary changes, such as avoiding multivitamins, vitamin C supplements, and iron supplements, which can increase iron throughout your body
No alcohol use (because alcohol increases the risk of liver damage)
Steps to prevent infections, including not eating uncooked fish and shellfish and getting recommended vaccinations, including those against hepatitis A and B

Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)
About Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)
KEY POINTS
HHT is a genetic disorder in which blood vessels do not develop normally leading to bleeding that can be serious or life threatening.
Frequent nosebleeds are the most common sign.
Complication can vary widely, even among affected family members.
Treatment to control bleeding and prevent complications may be needed.
What it is
HHT is a disorder in which some blood vessels do not develop properly. A person with HHT may form abnormal capillaries or abnormal capillary connections between the arteries and veins. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that pass blood from arteries to veins. The abnormal blood vessels formed in HHT are often fragile and can burst, causing bleeding. Men, women, and children from all racial and ethnic groups can be affected by HHT and experience the problems associated with this disorder, some of which are serious and potentially life-threatening. Fortunately, if HHT is discovered early, effective treatments are available. However, there is no cure for HHT.
Signs
Nosebleeds are the most common sign of HHT, resulting from small abnormal blood vessels within the inside layer of the nose. Abnormal blood vessels in the skin can appear on the hands, fingertips, face, lips, lining of the mouth, and nose as delicate red or purplish spots that lighten briefly when touched. Bleeding within the stomach or intestines is another possible indicator of HHT that occurs because of abnormal blood vessels lining the digestive tract. Additional signs of HHT include abnormal artery-vein connections within the brain, lungs, and liver, which often do not display any warning signs before rupturing.
Frequent nosebleeds are the most common sign of HHT.
Causes of HHT
HHT is a genetic disorder. Each person with HHT has a gene that is altered (mutated
), which causes HHT. It takes only one gene with a mutation to cause HHT. Hundreds of possible mutations in several different genes have been linked to HHT.
Diagnosis
HHT can be diagnosed by performing genetic testing. Most people with HHT are first diagnosed by using clinical criteria (presence of signs and a history of signs in a parent, sibling, or child).
Complications and Treatments
The complications of HHT can vary widely, even among people affected by HHT in the same family. Complications and treatment of HHT depend on the parts of the body that are affected by this disorder. Treatment may include controlling bleeding and anemia and preventing complications from abnormal artery-vein connections in the lungs and brain.

B Virus (herpes B, monkey B virus, herpesvirus simiae, and herpesvirus B)
About B Virus
KEY POINTS
B virus infection is extremely rare but can be serious and even deadly.
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people.
If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, begin first aid immediately and see a healthcare provider.
What it is
B virus infection is extremely rare. However, it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately.
People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms typically start within one month of being exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days.
The first indications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, you may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey.
As the disease progresses, the virus spreads to and causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain and spinal cord. Problems with breathing and death can occur one day to three weeks after symptoms appear.
Keep Reading:
B Virus Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
Most people will not come in contact with monkeys, so their risk of getting infected with B virus is very low.
However, laboratory workers, veterinarians, and people more likely exposed to macaque monkeys have a higher risk of getting B virus infection.
Keep Reading:
Risk Factors for B Virus
How it spreads
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. You can get infected with B virus if you:
Are bitten or scratched by an infected monkey.
Get an infected monkey's tissue or fluid on your broken skin or in your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Have a needle stick by a contaminated syringe.
Scratch or cut yourself on a contaminated cage or other sharp-edged surface.
Are exposed to the brain (especially), spinal cord, or skull of an infected monkey.
Keep Reading:
B Virus: Causes and How It Spreads
Prevention
There are no vaccines that can protect you against B virus infection.
If you are in a place with macaque monkeys, stay away from them so that you don't get bitten or scratched. You should not touch or feed monkeys.
People at increased risk should follow appropriate laboratory and animal facility protocols to reduce the spread of B virus.
Treatment and recovery
Get first aid immediately
If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, get first aid and seek immediate medical attention. Follow the steps below.
Thoroughly wash the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey and gently scrub with soap, detergent, or iodine for 15 minutes.
Run water over the wound or area for 15 to 20 minutes more.
Tell the healthcare provider that you have been exposed to a macaque monkey that may be infected with B virus.
If you got exposed to a macaque, wash right away and tell your doctor.
Medications
If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus exposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and treatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease.
How animals are affected
Macaque monkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they reach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do not have symptoms, or have just mild disease.

Genital Herpes
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
About Genital Herpes
KEY POINTS
Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can be treated.
People who are sexually active can get genital herpes.
This fact sheet answers basic questions about genital herpes.
Overview
What is genital herpes?
Genital herpes is an STI caused by two types of viruses – herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).
Oral herpes
HSV-1 often causes oral herpes, which can result in cold sores or fever blisters on or around the mouth. However, most people with oral herpes do not have any symptoms. Most people with oral herpes get it during childhood or young adulthood from non-sexual contact with saliva.
Genital herpes is common in the United States (U.S.). In 2018, CDC estimates show there were 572,000 new genital herpes infections in the U.S. among people aged 14 to 49.1
Signs and symptoms
How do I know I have genital herpes?
Genital herpes often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms.
Most people with genital herpes have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. Mild symptoms may go unnoticed or be mistaken for other skin conditions like a pimple or ingrown hair. Because of this, most people do not know they have a herpes infection.
Herpes Outbreak
Herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. This is known as having an ""outbreak"". The blisters break and leave painful sores that may take a week or more to heal. Flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, body aches, or swollen glands) also may occur during the first outbreak.
People who experience an initial outbreak of herpes can have repeated outbreaks, especially if they have HSV-2. However, repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although genital herpes is a lifelong infection, the number of outbreaks may decrease over time.
See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods.
Risk factors
What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?
Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, herpes increases the number of immune cells in the lining of the genitals. HIV targets immune cells for entry into the body. Having both HIV and genital herpes increases the chance of spreading HIV to a HIV-negative partner during oral, vagina, or anal sex.
How it spreads
How is genital herpes spread?
You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the infection. You can get herpes if you have contact with:
A herpes sore
Saliva from a partner with an oral herpes infection
Genital fluids from a partner with a genital herpes infection
Skin in the oral area of a partner with oral herpes
Skin in the genital area of a partner with genital herpes
You also can get genital herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or is unaware of their infection. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a partner with oral herpes.
You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools. You also will not get it from touching objects, such as silverware, soap, or towels.
If you have more questions about herpes, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.
Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?
Yes. Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex. This is why some cases of genital herpes are due to HSV-1.
Prevention
How can I prevent genital herpes?
The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who does not have herpes.
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex.
Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that a condom can cover. Also, the skin can release the virus (shed) from areas that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.
If your sex partner(s) has/have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting it if:
Your partner takes an anti-herpes medicine every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her healthcare provider.
You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., during an ""outbreak"").
I'm pregnant. If I have genital herpes, how can I protect my baby from getting it?
If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, prenatal care visits are very important. Some research suggest that a genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage or make it more likely to deliver your baby too early. You can pass herpes to your unborn child before birth, but it more commonly passes during delivery. This can lead to a deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting genital herpes during pregnancy. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had a genital herpes diagnosis or symptoms. Also tell them about any possible exposure to genital herpes.
If you have genital herpes, you may need to take anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes when you deliver. At the time of delivery, your healthcare provider should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have signs or symptoms of genital herpes at delivery, a 'C-section' is likely to occur.
Testing and diagnosis
How will my healthcare provider know if I have genital herpes?
Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at any sores that are present. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. If sores are not present, a blood test may be used to look for HSV antibodies.
Have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider about herpes testing and other STDs.
Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or when you got the infection.
Treatment and recovery
Is there a cure for genital herpes?
There is no cure for genital herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. A daily anti-herpes medicine can make it less likely to pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).
Can I still have sex if I have herpes?
If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) about their risk. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.
You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your health, sex life, and relationships. While herpes is not curable, it is important to know that it is manageable with medicine. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) can lower your risk of spreading the virus to others. Talk to a healthcare provider about your concerns and treatment options.
A genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships. Knowing how to talk to sexual partners about STIs
is important.
What happens if I don't get treated?
Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.
If you touch your sores or fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another body part like your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, quickly wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading the infection.
If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your unborn fetus, or newborn baby. See ""I'm pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?"" for information about this.

Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
About Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
KEY POINTS
About 1 in every 3 people in the United States will have shingles (or herpes zoster) in their lifetime.
Shingles can sometimes lead to serious complications like long-term nerve pain and vision loss.
The best way to protect yourself from shingles is vaccination.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Shingles is a painful rash illness. People get shingles when the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox, reactivates in their bodies after they have already had chickenpox.
An estimated 1 million people get shingles each year in this country. Most people who develop shingles only have it one time during their life. However, you can have shingles more than once.
Signs and symptoms
People with shingles most commonly have a rash around the left or right side of the body. The rash is usually painful, itchy, or tingly.
Shingles can lead to serious complications. The most common shingles complication is long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN.
Keep Reading:
Shingles Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
You are at risk for shingles if:
You have had chickenpox.
More than 99% of Americans born before 1980 had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it. Children can have shingles, but it is not common.
Your risk of shingles and serious complications increases:
As you get older.
If you have medical conditions that keep your immune systems from working properly such as certain cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, and HIV infection.
If you take drugs that keep your immune system from working properly, like steroids and drugs given after an organ transplant.
Causes and spread
If you are near someone with shingles:
You cannot get shingles from someone who has shingles.
You can get chickenpox from someone who has shingles if you never had chickenpox or never got chickenpox vaccine. You could then develop shingles later in life.
Shingles is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus stays in their body. The virus can reactivate later in life and cause shingles.
People who never had chickenpox or didn't get chickenpox vaccine can get infected with VZV from someone who has shingles. These people can get the virus through:
Direct contact with the fluid from shingles rash blisters.
Breathing in virus particles that come from the blisters.
People with chickenpox are more likely to spread VZV than people with shingles.
Keep Reading:
About Chickenpox
Prevention
Protect yourself with the vaccine. CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy.
Keep Reading:
Shingles Vaccine Recommendations
The best way to prevent shingles is by getting 2 doses of the vaccine.
If you have shingles, protect others
Covering the shingles rash can lower the risk of spreading the shingles virus to others. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before the blisters appear or after the rash scabs over.
To prevent spreading the virus to others:
Cover the rash
Avoid touching or scratching the rash
Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds
Avoid contact with the following people until your rash scabs over
Pregnant women who never had chickenpox or chickenpox vaccine
Premature or low birth weight infants
People with weakened immune systems
Treatment and recovery
Several antiviral medicines are available to treat shingles:
Acyclovir (ay-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Valacyclovir (va-luh-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Famciclovir (fam-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
These medicines shorten the length and severity of the illness. They work best when you take them as soon as the rash appears. If you think you have shingles, contact your doctor as soon as possible to talk about treatment.
Pain relief medicine may help with the pain caused by shingles. This can be over the counter or a prescription from your doctor. Wet compresses, calamine lotion, and warm oatmeal baths may help relieve itching.

See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly genital discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods.
Risk factors
What is the link between genital herpes and HIV?
Herpes infection can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. This provides a way for HIV to enter the body. Even without visible sores, herpes increases the number of immune cells in the lining of the genitals. HIV targets immune cells for entry into the body. Having both HIV and genital herpes increases the chance of spreading HIV to a HIV-negative partner during oral, vagina, or anal sex.
How it spreads
How is genital herpes spread?
You can get genital herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the infection. You can get herpes if you have contact with:
A herpes sore
Saliva from a partner with an oral herpes infection
Genital fluids from a partner with a genital herpes infection
Skin in the oral area of a partner with oral herpes
Skin in the genital area of a partner with genital herpes
You also can get genital herpes from a sex partner who does not have a visible sore or is unaware of their infection. It is also possible to get genital herpes if you receive oral sex from a partner with oral herpes.
You will not get herpes from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools. You also will not get it from touching objects, such as silverware, soap, or towels.
If you have more questions about herpes, consider discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider.
Is there a link between genital herpes and oral herpes?
Yes. Oral herpes caused by HSV-1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex. This is why some cases of genital herpes are due to HSV-1.
Prevention
How can I prevent genital herpes?
The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of getting genital herpes:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who does not have herpes.
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex.
Be aware that not all herpes sores occur in areas that a condom can cover. Also, the skin can release the virus (shed) from areas that do not have a visible herpes sore. For these reasons, condoms may not fully protect you from getting herpes.
If your sex partner(s) has/have genital herpes, you can lower your risk of getting it if:
Your partner takes an anti-herpes medicine every day. This is something your partner should discuss with his or her healthcare provider.
You avoid having vaginal, anal, or oral sex when your partner has herpes symptoms (i.e., during an ""outbreak"").
I'm pregnant. If I have genital herpes, how can I protect my baby from getting it?
If you are pregnant and have genital herpes, prenatal care visits are very important. Some research suggest that a genital herpes infection may lead to miscarriage or make it more likely to deliver your baby too early. You can pass herpes to your unborn child before birth, but it more commonly passes during delivery. This can lead to a deadly infection in your baby (called neonatal herpes). It is important that you avoid getting genital herpes during pregnancy. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had a genital herpes diagnosis or symptoms. Also tell them about any possible exposure to genital herpes.
If you have genital herpes, you may need to take anti-herpes medicine towards the end of your pregnancy. This medicine may reduce your risk of having signs or symptoms of genital herpes when you deliver. At the time of delivery, your healthcare provider should carefully examine you for herpes sores. If you have signs or symptoms of genital herpes at delivery, a 'C-section' is likely to occur.
Testing and diagnosis
How will my healthcare provider know if I have genital herpes?
Your healthcare provider may diagnose genital herpes by simply looking at any sores that are present. Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) and test it. If sores are not present, a blood test may be used to look for HSV antibodies.
Have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider about herpes testing and other STDs.
Please note: A herpes blood test can help determine if you have herpes infection. It cannot tell you who gave you the infection or when you got the infection.
Treatment and recovery
Is there a cure for genital herpes?
There is no cure for genital herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. A daily anti-herpes medicine can make it less likely to pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).
Can I still have sex if I have herpes?
If you have herpes, you should talk to your sex partner(s) about their risk. Using condoms may help lower this risk but it will not get rid of the risk completely. Having sores or other symptoms of herpes can increase your risk of spreading the disease. Even if you do not have any symptoms, you can still infect your sex partners.
You may have concerns about how genital herpes will impact your health, sex life, and relationships. While herpes is not curable, it is important to know that it is manageable with medicine. Daily suppressive therapy (i.e., daily use of antiviral medication) can lower your risk of spreading the virus to others. Talk to a healthcare provider about your concerns and treatment options.
A genital herpes diagnosis may affect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships. Knowing how to talk to sexual partners about STIs
is important.
What happens if I don't get treated?
Genital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with suppressed immune systems.
If you touch your sores or fluids from the sores, you may transfer herpes to another body part like your eyes. Do not touch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. If you do touch the sores or fluids, quickly wash your hands thoroughly to help avoid spreading the infection.
If you are pregnant, there can be problems for you and your unborn fetus, or newborn baby. See ""I'm pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?"" for information about this.
B Virus (herpes B, monkey B virus, herpesvirus simiae, and herpesvirus B)
About B Virus
KEY POINTS
B virus infection is extremely rare but can be serious and even deadly.
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people.
If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, begin first aid immediately and see a healthcare provider.
What it is
B virus infection is extremely rare. However, it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately.
People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms typically start within one month of being exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days.
The first indications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, you may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey.
As the disease progresses, the virus spreads to and causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain and spinal cord. Problems with breathing and death can occur one day to three weeks after symptoms appear.
Keep Reading:
B Virus Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
Most people will not come in contact with monkeys, so their risk of getting infected with B virus is very low.
However, laboratory workers, veterinarians, and people more likely exposed to macaque monkeys have a higher risk of getting B virus infection.
Keep Reading:
Risk Factors for B Virus
How it spreads
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. You can get infected with B virus if you:
Are bitten or scratched by an infected monkey.
Get an infected monkey's tissue or fluid on your broken skin or in your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Have a needle stick by a contaminated syringe.
Scratch or cut yourself on a contaminated cage or other sharp-edged surface.
Are exposed to the brain (especially), spinal cord, or skull of an infected monkey.
Keep Reading:
B Virus: Causes and How It Spreads
Prevention
There are no vaccines that can protect you against B virus infection.
If you are in a place with macaque monkeys, stay away from them so that you don't get bitten or scratched. You should not touch or feed monkeys.
People at increased risk should follow appropriate laboratory and animal facility protocols to reduce the spread of B virus.
Treatment and recovery
Get first aid immediately
If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, get first aid and seek immediate medical attention. Follow the steps below.
Thoroughly wash the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey and gently scrub with soap, detergent, or iodine for 15 minutes.
Run water over the wound or area for 15 to 20 minutes more.
Tell the healthcare provider that you have been exposed to a macaque monkey that may be infected with B virus.
If you got exposed to a macaque, wash right away and tell your doctor.
Medications
If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus exposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and treatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease.
How animals are affected
Macaque monkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they reach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do not have symptoms, or have just mild disease.

Hierarchy of Controls
About Hierarchy of Controls
KEY POINTS
The hierarchy of controls identifies a preferred order of actions to best control hazardous workplace exposures.
Elimination, substitution, and engineering controls are more effective because they control exposures without significant human interaction.
Administrative controls and personal protective equipment can also be effective at reducing workers' exposures to hazards.
Overview
Controlling exposures to hazards in the workplace is vital to protecting workers. The hierarchy of controls is a way of determining which actions will best control exposures.
The hierarchy of controls has five levels of actions to reduce or remove hazards. The preferred order of action based on general effectiveness is:
Elimination
Substitution
Engineering controls
Administrative controls
Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Using this hierarchy can lower worker exposures and reduce risk of illness or injury.
The hierarchy of controls should be followed from top to bottom.
Elimination
Elimination removes the hazard at the source. This could include changing the work process to stop using a toxic chemical, heavy object, or sharp tool. It is the preferred solution to protect workers because no exposure can occur.
Substitution
Substitution is using a safer alternative to the source of the hazard. An example is using plant-based printing inks as a substitute for solvent-based inks.
When considering a substitute, it's important to compare the potential new risks of the substitute to the original risks. This review should consider how the substitute will combine with other agents in the workplace. Effective substitutes reduce the potential for harmful effects and do not create new risks.
Elimination and substitution can be the most difficult actions to adopt into an existing process. These methods are best used at the design or development stage of a work process, place, or tool. At the development stage, elimination and substitution may be the simplest and cheapest option. Another good opportunity to use elimination and substitution is when selecting new equipment or procedures. Prevention through Design is an approach to proactively include prevention when designing work equipment, tools, operations, and spaces.
Engineering controls
Engineering controls reduce or prevent hazards from coming into contact with workers. Engineering controls can include modifying equipment or the workspace, using protective barriers, ventilation, and more. The NIOSH Engineering Controls Database has examples of published engineering control research findings.
The most effective engineering controls:
Are part of the original equipment design
Remove or block the hazard at the source before it comes into contact with the worker
Prevent users from modifying or interfering with the control
Need minimal user action for the controls to work
Operate correctly without interfering with the work process or making the work process more difficult
Engineering controls can cost more upfront than administrative controls or PPE. However, long-term operating costs tend to be lower, especially when protecting multiple workers. In addition, engineering controls can save money in other areas of the work process or facility operation.
Administrative controls
Administrative controls establish work practices that reduce the duration, frequency, or intensity of exposure to hazards. This may include:
Work process training
Job rotation
Ensuring adequate rest breaks
Limiting access to hazardous areas or machinery
Adjusting line speeds
Personal protective equipment (PPE)
PPE is equipment worn to minimize exposure to hazards. Examples of PPE include gloves, safety glasses, hearing protection, hard hats, and respirators. When employees use PPE, employers should implement a PPE program. While elements of the PPE program depend on the work process and the identified PPE, the program should include:
Workplace hazards assessment
PPE selection and use
Inspection and replacement of damaged or worn-out PPE
Employee training
Program monitoring for continued effectiveness
Employers should not rely on PPE alone to control hazards when other effective control options are available. PPE can be effective, but only when workers use it correctly and consistently. PPE might seem to be less expensive than other controls, but can be costly over time. This is especially true when used for multiple workers on a daily basis.
When other control methods are unable to reduce the hazardous exposure to safe levels, employers must provide PPE.
This includes:
While other controls are under development
When other controls cannot sufficiently reduce the hazardous exposure
When PPE is the only control option available
Administrative controls and PPE require significant and ongoing effort by workers and their supervisors. They are useful when employers are in the process of implementing other control methods from the hierarchy. Additionally, administrative controls and PPE are often applied to existing processes where hazards are not well controlled.
Train and evaluate
Training and evaluation can help ensure selected controls are successful. Employers should correctly train workers and supervisors on how to use controls. Workers and their supervisors should evaluate controls on a regular basis. Regular evaluation can check whether controls are effective in reducing workers' exposures and identify potential improvements.

Histoplasmosis
FUNGAL DISEASES
About Histoplasmosis
KEY POINTS
Histoplasmosis is a lung infection, or pneumonia, caused by breathing in spores of the fungus Histoplasma from the environment.
It is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late.
Infection can be mild to severe and can even lead to meningitis.
Early testing and antifungal treatment helps prevent severe infections.
Overview
Histoplasmosis is a lung infection caused by breathing in Histoplasma, a fungus. Histoplasma lives in the environment in parts of the United States and the world.
Most of the time when people breathe in the fungal spores, they do not get sick. However, Histoplasmosis can cause mild to life-threatening symptoms of pneumonia. Histoplasmosis is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late because the symptoms are similar to more common pneumonias caused by bacteria or viruses.
People can get histoplasmosis from breathing in Histoplasma spores.
Symptoms
Symptoms of histoplasmosis include:
Fever
Cough
Fatigue (extreme tiredness)
Chills
Headache
Chest pain
Body aches
These symptoms usually appear 3 to 17 days after breathing in the fungus. Learn more about symptoms of histoplasmosis.
Severe infections
Histoplasmosis can develop into a long-term lung infection, specifically among people with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, it can spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).
View Larger
Signs and symptoms of fungal meningitis.
Causes
Histoplasmosis is caused by breathing in fungal spores from Histoplasma, a fungus that lives in soil. It also spreads in bird and bat droppings that mix in soil. In the United States, the fungus mainly lives in the central and eastern states.
Histoplasmosis does not spread between people or between people and pets (cats and dogs).
Keep Reading:
Histoplasmosis: Causes and How It Spreads
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers diagnose histoplasmosis by collecting a sample of blood or urine for laboratory testing. it usually takes a few days to a couple of weeks to receive results.
Additonal testing may include:
Imaging tests like an X-ray or CT scan of the lungs.
Testing fluid from the lung or respiratory tract.
Testing a biopsy (small piece of infected tissues from the body).
When to ask about testing
Histoplasmosis causes the same symptoms of pneumonia that bacteria and viruses cause. Because pneumonia caused by bacteria is far more common than fungal pneumonia, healthcare providers usually prescribe antibiotic treatment first.
Antibiotics are drugs designed to kill bacteria, not fungi. They will not help treat histoplasmosis or other pneumonias caused by fungi.
Patients should ask healthcare providers about testing for histoplasmosis if they live in or recently traveled to an area where Histoplasma lives and:
Have symptoms of pneumonia.
Already took prescribed antibiotics and are not getting better.
Additional considerations for testing for histoplamsosis include:
Patient risk factors.
Imaging results that suggest histoplamsosis.
Connection to an outbreak.
Treatment and recovery
Symptoms sometimes go away on their own without treatment.
Prescription antifungal medication is needed to treat:
Severe or chronic (long-term) lung infections
Infections that spread to other parts of hte body and meningitis.
Itraconazole is one type of antifungal medication that’s commonly used to treat histoplasmosis. Amphotericin B is another medication that might be needed in severe histoplasmosis.
Treatment can range from 3 months to one year. The length of treatment depends on severity of the infection and immune status.
Animal impact
Pets, particularly cats, can get histoplasmosis, but it does not spread between animals and people. Many cats and dogs exposed to Histoplasma never get sick. Symptoms of histoplasmosis in pets are similar to those in people, including coughing, lack of energy, and weight loss.

Histoplasmosis
About Histoplasmosis and Work
KEY POINTS
Anyone who works with or near material contaminated with Histoplasma can develop histoplasmosis.
There are ways to prevent work-related histoplasmosis.
There are also methods people can use to protect themselves and others from exposure.
Overview
Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by a fungus called Histoplasma. Anyone who works with or near material contaminated with Histoplasma can develop histoplasmosis.
The fungus lives in the environment, particularly in soil that contains large amounts of bird or bat droppings. People can get histoplasmosis after breathing in the microscopic fungal spores (also known as conidia) from the air.
Most people exposed to Histoplasma never have symptoms. For people who do get sick, the severity of histoplasmosis varies widely. The severity depends on:
The amount and length of the exposure.
If the person is at higher risk for developing the severe forms.
Symptoms of histoplasmosis usually appear between 3 and 17 days after a person breathes in the fungal spores. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and fatigue.
What to do
What to do if you are exposed at your workplace
If you think you've been exposed to Histoplasma at work, you should contact:
Your crew leader or supervisor.
Your occupational health or risk management department.
If your workplace does not have these services, you should contact your local city, county, or state health department. We do not know if antifungal medication (prophylaxis) can prevent histoplasmosis after a workplace exposure. However, it can be considered for high-risk exposures.
For more information about laboratory exposures to Histoplasma, please see Safety guidelines for laboratory workers who handle Histoplasma.
What to do if you are sick
If you think you have histoplasmosis after working in an area where Histoplasma is common:
Report your symptoms to your crew leader or supervisor.
Visit a healthcare provider, if needed.
Tell them you work in an area where Histoplasma is common.
Ask to be tested for histoplasmosis.
People at increased risk
Activities associated with histoplasmosis
Environmental disruption of Histoplasma habitats is often a key factor associated with histoplasmosis outbreaks.1 It is also associated with isolated cases,2 although to a lesser extent. These activities include:
Disturbance of large accumulations of bird or bat droppings.A
Soil disruption (digging or excavation).
Plant matter disruption (handling trees or landscaping).
Demolition, construction, or renovation.
Working in caves.
Jobs associated with histoplasmosis
In areas where Histoplasma is common, workers in some industries may be at higher risk for histoplasmosis:
Construction, demolition, and extraction occupations.
Agriculture and forestry industries.
People who are also at risk include:
Workers in occupations or industries exposed to bird or bat droppings.
Those involved with activities that disrupt the environment.
Most of what we know about jobs that may be related to a higher chance of getting sick comes from outbreak investigations. Approximately one-third of histoplasmosis outbreaks in the United States are work-related.1 However, outbreak-related histoplasmosis cases represent only a small fraction of overall known cases (about 5%).2 Examples of people affected by work-related histoplasmosis outbreaks include:1
Bridge workers.

HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD & Tuberculosis Prevention in Pregnancy
KEY POINTS
Infections with HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, and TB can complicate pregnancy and may have serious consequences for a woman, her pregnancy outcomes, and her baby.
Screening and treatment for these infections, and vaccinations against viruses can prevent many bad outcomes.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Overview
Infection with HIV, viral hepatitis or STIs can affect the wellbeing of the mother, the pregnancy outcome, and child.
Screening and treatment for these infections, and vaccinations against viruses, such as hepatitis B and human papillomavirus, can prevent many bad outcomes.
Screening for infections is the first step in accessing the care and treatment needed to prevent transmission of the infection to the infant and to improve the mother's health. Prenatal screening for some infections (HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus) is recommended for all pregnant women. Screening for other infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, and TB) is recommended for some women at risk for infection.
For additional information on screening for women at higher risk for STIs, visit STDs during Pregnancy – CDC Fact Sheet (Detailed)
For information about TB diagnosis during pregnancy, visit TB and Pregnancy.
Prevention tips
To protect all women and infants, CDC recommends the following:
Hepatitis B Virus Infection (HBV)
All pregnant women should be screened during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing. Pregnant women with a history of appropriately timed triple panel screening and without subsequent risk for exposure to HBV (i.e., no new HBV exposures since triple panel screening) only need hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening. Testing pregnant women known to be chronically infected or immune enables documentation of the HBsAg test result during that pregnancy to ensure timely prophylaxis for exposed infants. Newborns of pregnant women who are HBsAg positive should receive the HepB vaccine and HepB immune globulin at birth and complete the HepB vaccine series according to the recommended vaccination schedule.
Hepatitis C Virus Infection (HCV)
All pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis C during each pregnancy. While there is no treatment available to prevent transmission of HCV infection from mother to child, screening for HCV infection during pregnancy allows health care providers to identify infected women who should receive treatment during the postpartum period and infants who should receive testing during a pediatric visit. Identification of HCV infection during pregnancy also can inform pregnancy and delivery management issues that might reduce the risk of HCV transmission to the infant.
HIV
All pregnant women should be tested for HIV as early as possible, preferably at the first prenatal visit. The earlier HIV is diagnosed and treated, the more effective HIV medicines — called antiretroviral therapy or ART — can be at preventing transmission and improving the health outcomes of both mother and child.
Syphilis
All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, ideally during the first trimester of pregnancy. Among women who may be less likely to receive prenatal care, consider testing at the time of pregnancy testing. The earlier syphilis is diagnosed and treated during pregnancy, the more likely congenital syphilis and its complications (such as stillbirth) can be prevented in the infant. Penicillin G is effective for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus, as well as treating fetal and maternal infection. Pregnant women who live in communities with high rates of syphilis, who are at high risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., substance use or a new sex partner), or who were not previously tested during the pregnancy should also be screened again at 28 weeks and at delivery.
Tuberculosis (TB)
Healthcare providers should assess all persons, including pregnant women, for risk factors associated with latent TB infection and TB disease. While universal testing for latent TB infection and TB disease is not recommended for pregnant women in the United States, targeted testing for those with risk factors, including people living with HIV infection, people born in high TB prevalence countries, and those who are known contacts of persons with TB disease, facilitates prompt initiation of curative treatment for those with TB disease.

Soil-Transmitted Helminths
About Soil-transmitted helminths
KEY POINTS
Soil-transmitted Helminths, or STH, are parasitic worms that live in the human intestine.
They spread through soil or water contaminated by human feces (poop) that contain the parasite larvae.
STH infections are considered neglected tropical diseases or NTDs.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities.
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer.
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are:
Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.
Contaminating drinking water sources.
Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.
Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil.
Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.
Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.
Hookworm
You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.
Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.
One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Blood and protein or nutrient loss
Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)
Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections
Wash your hands before handling food.
Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.
Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.
Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or ""preventive chemotherapy"".
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other ""neglected tropical diseases"" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.
Zoonotic Hookworm
PARASITES 
About Zoonotic Hookworm
KEY POINTS
Zoonotic hookworm is a parasite common in cats and dogs.
It lives in soil contaminated with animal feces (poop).
It burrows into people's skin, leaving red, itchy tracks.
Most people who are infected recover without treatment.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Zoonotic hookworms are parasites that normally live in animals like dogs or cats. However, they can spread to humans through the skin. When they infect people, the hookworms can cause a disease called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM).
People become infected when young hookworms, known as larvae, burrow into unprotected skin. This can happen when people are walking barefoot or sitting (with exposed skin) on soil or sand contaminated by animal feces.
Signs and symptoms
Zoonotic hookworm larva cause CLM by burrowing into the skin of a person's foot or body. This burrowing can cause:
Severe itching
Raised red lines on skin, also called tracks
These symptoms will go away after several weeks as the parasite dies.
In rare cases, some types of hookworm may infect deeper tissue in the intestine, lungs, or possibly the eye.
Risk factors
Cases of CLM often occur in people who have traveled to tropical regions where dog and cat hookworm larvae can survive in the soil.
If you walk barefoot in soil or sand in these regions, you can get zoonotic hookworm. However, you can find zoonotic hookworms anywhere in the world. In the United States, they're more common on the East Coast than the West Coast.
How it spreads
Animals infected with hookworm pass the parasites' eggs out of their body in their feces.
The eggs mature and hatch, releasing young hookworms, or larvae, into the soil or sand.
When you step on or sit in that soil with your bare skin, hookworm larvae can latch onto you and begin to burrow into your skin.
Prevention
Dispose of animal waste quickly to keep eggs from getting into soil and hatching.
Make sure dogs and cats get regular veterinary care, including deworming if needed.
Wear shoes and avoid skin contact with contaminated sand or soil.
If you travel to tropical or subtropical climates, especially where there are beaches, wear shoes and use protective mats or other coverings to keep your skin from touching sand or soil directly.
Diagnosis
If you have symptoms of CLM, speak with your healthcare provider. Your provider will examine your skin for itchy, red tracks made by hookworms, usually on the legs or feet.
There is no blood test for zoonotic hookworm infection. But your provider may ask you about recent travel and can help provide an accurate diagnosis.
Treatment
Most people with a zoonotic hookworm infection recover without medical treatment in 5 – 6 weeks, as the parasites that cause CLM die.
But in some cases, a healthcare provider might prescribe
Antiparasitic drugs to help kill hookworms
Antibiotics to help treat any bacterial infections in the damaged skin

Horses
WHAT TO KNOW
People who work with or own horses should be aware that horses can sometimes carry germs that can make people sick.
Wash your hands after working with horses or touching their food or items in their environment.
Ensure horses receive routine veterinary care to keep them healthy and prevent the spread of disease.
Overview
From pulling a plow over a farmer's field to carrying a cowboy across the open range, horses have always had an important role in society. Today, horses are generally considered companion animals, with close to 2 million U.S. households reporting horse ownership.
Riding and working around horses have been shown to increase balance, self-confidence, and self-esteem. However, as with any animal, people who work with or own horses should be aware that sometimes horses can carry harmful germs that can cause a variety of illnesses in people, ranging from minor skin infections to serious illnesses. Besides touching a horse, common chores such as cleaning stalls and grooming might put you at risk. One of the best ways you can protect yourself from getting sick is to thoroughly wash your hands after handling, cleaning up after, or feeding horses.
Diseases
Below are diseases that can be spread by horses.
Anaplasmosis
Anthrax
Brucellosis
Cryptosporidiosis
Dermatophilosis
(Lumpy wool, Strawberry foot rot, rainscald, rainrot)
Eastern equine encephalitis
Leptospirosis
Lyme disease
MRSA
Rabies
Ringworm
Salmonella infection
Tularemia
Vesicular stomatitis
Western equine encephalitis
West Nile virus
How to stay healthy around horses
Always wash hands after interacting with horses to avoid illness.
Before you interact with horses, be aware that they can sometimes carry germs that can make people sick, even when they appear healthy and clean. Always get routine veterinary care for your horse to keep it healthy and to prevent infectious diseases.
Wash your hands
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and running water:
After contact with horses or their equipment
After doing chores such as cleaning stalls, brushing your horse, or cleaning equipment
After riding your horse or touching horse poop, urine, saliva, or blood
Before you eat or drink
Adults should supervise hand washing for children under 5 years old.
Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Be sure to have hand sanitizer readily available near the horse's stall to encourage others to use it before handling the horse or its equipment.
Prevent horse bites and kicks
Kicks and bites from horses can cause serious injury and sometimes illness. Bites and kicks can spread germs, even if the wound does not seem deep or serious.
Be aware of your surroundings and know where the horse is at all times.
Be cautious when approaching a horse.
Approach a horse's head from the side where they can see you better—not from the front.
Watch their ears—if the ears are flattened, the horse might bite.
Don't stand directly behind a horse.
Don't approach a horse from its rear end.
Don't leave young children unsupervised around horses.
What to do if you are bitten or injured by a horse
If you are injured by a horse, you should:
Wash wounds with warm, soapy water immediately.
Seek medical attention if:
You don't know the vaccination status of the horse.
The horse might have been exposed to a rabid animal. Make sure a veterinarian checks the horse if it becomes sick or dies within 6 months of a bite from another animal.
The horse appears sick or is acting unusual.
The wound or injury is serious (uncontrolled bleeding, unable to move, extreme pain, muscle or bone is showing, or the bite is over a joint).
The wound or site of injury becomes red, painful, warm, or swollen (especially if the person bitten is 5 years of age or younger, 65 years of age or older, a pregnant woman, or has a weakened immune system.)
Your or your child's last tetanus shot was more than 5 years ago.
How to keep horses healthy
Cleaning horse stables regularly helps prevent the spread of disease.
Before choosing a horse
Learn about the different types of horses and temperaments before you bring one home.
Find out what types of horses are suitable for your family. Some horses, such as young or untrained horses, might not be suitable for young children or people with very little riding experience.
Research how to properly care for your horse. Ask a veterinarian about the proper food, care, and stall or pasture environment for the horse you are selecting.
Be aware of the potential for your horse to spread germs to people and other animals.
How to choose a horse
Match the horse's attitude, temperament, size, and training or activity level with:
Your family's time and ability to train and care for them
The purpose for which you are buying the horse (for example, showing, trail riding, teaching)
Consider having the horse thoroughly examined by a veterinarian before purchase to make sure the animal is healthy and is not carrying diseases that could pass to people.
If you are bringing the horse into a herd setting, you might need to keep the horse separate for a short time to prevent any diseases from spreading to your other horses.
Some general guidelines for choosing to separate a newly purchased horse are if:
It has an unknown medical history
It is coming from an unknown source, sale barn, or horse show where it has been in contact with unknown horses
It traveled a long distance and is stressed or showing signs of disease, such as a cough, runny nose, swollen lymph nodes, fever or diarrhea
For more information on separating newly acquired horses, contact a veterinarian.
How to house your horse
House horses in a stall, out on pasture, or in a combination of both. If they are out on pasture, they should have some kind of shelter in case of bad weather.
Make sure your horse always has access to clean water, whether in a stall or out in a pasture.
Clean horse stalls daily to prevent build-up of feces (poop) that could spread disease to your horse or to you and your family.
Dispose of poop, soiled bedding, and uneaten food properly.
Monitor your horse's health
Have your veterinarian visit your horse's stall often to care for and check your horse's health.
Talk to your veterinarian about vaccinations for rabies, West Nile, and other viruses causing equine encephalitis.
If possible, keep horses in an enclosed area at night to decrease their exposure to wild animals that could be carrying rabies and other diseases.
Use feeders that are above the ground to keep wild animals away from your horse and your horse's food.

Healthy Swimming
Preventing Hot Tub Rash
KEY POINTS
If contaminated water stays on someone's skin for a long time, it can cause a rash known as ""hot tub rash"" (Pseudomonas folliculitis).
Hot tub rash is caused by the germ Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is commonly found in the environment (for example, in water or soil).
Symptoms of hot tub rash
Hot tub rash usually appears a few days after sitting in a poorly maintained hot tub.
Hot tub rash can affect people of all ages. It is often worse in areas where a swimsuit held contaminated water up against the skin. Symptoms include:
Itchy, red, and bumpy rash
Pus-filled blisters around hair follicles
Mild rashes usually clear up in a few days without medical treatment. Check with your healthcare provider if a rash gets worse or if you get it more than once.
Prevention steps and strategies
To reduce the risk of hot tub rash
Remove your swimsuit and shower with soap after getting out of the water, especially hot tubs.
Wash your swimsuit after using it.
Use test strips to check the water, especially in hot tubs, for adequate disinfectant level and pH. CDC recommends the following disinfectant (chlorine or bromine) and pH levels for hot tubs:
Chlorine: at least 3 parts per million (ppm or mg/L). If the reading is above 10ppm, talk to the operator or owner.
Bromine: 4–8 ppm
pH: 7.0–7.8
If chlorine level, bromine level, or pH is not within the correct range, tell the operator or owner immediately.

Human Metapneumovirus
About Human Metapneumovirus
KEY POINTS
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause respiratory disease.
HMPV spreads from person to person or surfaces to person.
Symptoms include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.
Your health care provider can test, however, there is no treatment.
Prevention measures include hand washing, cleaning surfaces, and staying home when sick.
Overview
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Discovered in 2001, HMPV is in the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Broader use of molecular diagnostic testing has increased identification and awareness of HMPV as an important cause of upper and lower respiratory infection.
CDC Expert Commentary with Medscape
Human Metapneumovirus: Common yet Underdiagnosed

Run time: [3:42 mins]
Released 8/15/2016
Symptoms
Symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections. The estimated incubation period is 3 to 6 days, and the median duration of illness can vary depending upon severity but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses.
How it spreads
HMPV is most likely spread from an infected person to others through
secretions from coughing and sneezing
close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands
touching objects or surfaces that have the viruses on them then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes
In the U.S., HMPV circulates in distinct annual seasons. HMPV circulation begins in winter and lasts until or through spring.
Surveillance and Seasonality
Surveillance data from CDC's the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) shows HMPV to be most active during late winter and spring in temperate climates. HMPV, RSV, and influenza can circulate simultaneously during the respiratory virus season.
Prevention
Your patients can help prevent the spread of HMPV and other respiratory viruses by following these steps:
Wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (see CDC's Clean Hands Save Lives!).
Avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Patients who have cold-like symptoms should
cover their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing
wash their hands frequently and correctly (with soap and water for at least 20 seconds)
avoid sharing their cups and eating utensils with others
refrain from kissing others
stay at home when they are sick
In addition, cleaning possible contaminated surfaces (such as doorknobs and shared toys) may potentially help stop the spread of HMPV.
In healthcare settings, healthcare providers should follow CDC's 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings.
Testing and diagnosis
Since HMPV is a recently recognized respiratory virus, healthcare professionals may not routinely consider or test for HMPV. However, healthcare professionals should consider HMPV testing during winter and spring, especially when HMPV is commonly circulating.
Infection with HMPV can be confirmed usually by
direct detection of viral genome by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), and
direct detection of viral antigens in respiratory secretions using immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay.
Treatment
Currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPV and no vaccine to prevent HMPV. Medical care is supportive.

About HPV
KEY POINTS
HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a common virus that can cause cancers later in life.
You can protect your child from these cancers with HPV vaccination.
Nearly everyone who is not vaccinated will get HPV at some point in their lives.
What it is
HPV infections are very common. Nearly everyone will get HPV at some point in their lives.
More than 42 million Americans are infected with types of HPV that are known to cause disease.
About 13 million Americans, including teens, become infected each year.
HPV is spread through intimate skin-to-skin contact. You can get HPV by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the virus, even if they don't have signs or symptoms.

Basic Information about HPV and Cancer
How it affects your body
Most HPV infections (9 out of 10) go away by themselves within 2 years. But sometimes, HPV infections will last longer and can cause some cancers. HPV infections can cause cancers of the:
Cervix, vagina, and vulva
Penis
Anus
Back of the throat (called oropharyngeal cancer), including the base of the tongue and tonsils
Every year in the United States, HPV causes about 36,000 cases of cancer in both men and women.

Cancers Caused by HPV
Prevention
Protect your child with vaccination. CDC recommends 2 doses of HPV vaccine at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccination can be started at age 9 years.
Children who get the first dose before their 15th birthday need only 2 doses.
Teens who get the first dose on or after their 15th birthday need 3 doses.
The HPV vaccine series is most effective when given before a person is exposed to the virus.

CDC recommends 2 doses of HPV vaccine at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccination can be started at age 9 years.
Introduction
HPV vaccination provides safe, effective, and lasting protection against the HPV infections that most commonly cause cancer. The HPV vaccine series is most effective when given before a person is exposed to the virus.
Every year in the United States, HPV causes about 36,000 cases of cancer in both men and women.

Reasons to Get Vaccinated
Available vaccines
There are several types of HPV vaccines. That's why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later. It protects your child long before they ever have contact with the virus.
Gardasil-9
Gardasil-9 (9vHPV) is the vaccine distributed in the United States. This vaccine protects against nine HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).
Other vaccine types
In the past, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil, 4vHPV) and bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix, 2vHPV) were licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
All of the HPV vaccines protect against HPV types 16 and 18 that cause most HPV cancers.
Recommendations
Children ages 11–12 years should get 2 doses of HPV vaccine, given 6 to 12 months apart. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9. Only 2 doses are needed if the first dose was given before 15th birthday.
1st dose
11–12 years old (can start at age 9)
2nd dose
6–12 months after the 1st dose
Children 9–14 years old who have received 2 doses of HPV vaccine less than 5 months apart will need a third dose.
People 15–26 years old who start the series later need 3 doses of HPV vaccine.
The doses are given over 6 months.
If your teen isn't vaccinated yet, talk to their doctor about doing so as soon as possible.
People with weakened immune systems should get 3 doses if they are 9–26 years old.
People older than 26 years. Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years.
Some adults age 27 through 45 years who are not already vaccinated may decide to get HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination for them.
HPV vaccination in this age range provides less benefit, because more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV.
Why getting vaccinated is important
HPV is a very common virus that can cause cancers later in life. About 13 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year. You can protect your child from these cancers with HPV vaccine.
Who should get vaccinated
HPV vaccination is recommended at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9 years. All preteens need HPV vaccination, so they are protected from HPV infections that can cause cancer later in life.
Teens and young adults through age 26 years who didn't start or finish the HPV vaccine series also need HPV vaccination.
Who shouldn't get vaccinated
Tell your doctor about any severe allergies. Some people should not get some HPV vaccines if they:
Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of an HPV vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV vaccine.
Have an allergy to yeast (Gardasil and Gardasil 9).
Are pregnant.
HPV vaccines are safe for children who are mildly ill. This includes those with a low-grade fever of less than 101 degrees, a cold, runny nose, or cough. People with a moderate or severe illness should wait until they are better.
The vaccine is safe and effective
HPV vaccination works extremely well. HPV vaccine has the potential to prevent more than 90% of cancers caused by HPV.
Fewer teens and young adults are getting genital warts.
HPV vaccination has also reduced the number of cases of pre-cancers of the cervix in young women.
The protection provided by HPV vaccines lasts a long time. People who received HPV vaccines were followed for at least about 12 years, and their protection against HPV has remained high with no evidence of decreasing over time.
HPV infections and cervical pre-cancers (abnormal cells on the cervix that can lead to cancer) have dropped since 2006, when HPV vaccines were first used in the United States.
Among teen girls, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 88%.
Among young adult women, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 81%.
Among vaccinated women, the percentage of cervical pre-cancers caused by the HPV types most often linked to cervical cancer has dropped by 40%.
Keep in mind
That's why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later. It protects your child long before they ever have contact with the virus.
Possible side effects
Many people who get HPV vaccine have no side effects at all. Some people report having very mild side effects, like a sore arm from the shot.
The most common side effects of HPV vaccine are usually mild and include:
Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given
Fever
Dizziness or fainting (fainting after any vaccine, including HPV vaccine, is more common among adolescents than others)
Headache or feeling tired
Nausea
Muscle or joint pain
To prevent fainting and injuries from fainting, teens should be seated or lying down during vaccination; they should also do the same for 15 minutes after getting the shot.
Finding and paying for the vaccine
Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. If your doctor does not stock HPV vaccine, ask for a referral. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, or schools. You can contact your state health department to learn more about where to get HPV vaccine in your community.

Where to Find Vaccines
Vaccine costs
There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines:
Health insurance
Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers.
Vaccines for Children Program
Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines.
Parainfluenza
About Human Parainfluenza Viruses (HPIVs)
WHAT TO KNOW
Signs and symptoms of HPIVs are similar to the common cold.
Washing hands, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick can help prevent infection.
Most people with HPIVs will recover on their own.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Signs and symptoms
HPIVs commonly cause upper and lower respiratory illnesses in infants, young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, but anyone can get infected. Symptoms generally appear 2 to 6 days after infection.
Signs and symptoms are similar to the common cold and can include:
fever
runny nose
cough
sneezing
sore throat
Other symptoms of HPIV illness may include:
ear pain
irritability
decreased appetite
HPIVs can also cause more serious illness in children, including:
croup (infection of the vocal cords [larynx], windpipe [trachea], and sometimes into the bronchial tubes [bronchi])
bronchitis (infection of the main air passages that connect the windpipe to the lungs)
bronchiolitis (infection in the smallest air passages in the lungs)
pneumonia (an infection of the lungs)
Symptoms of more serious illness may include:
barking cough
hoarseness
stridor (noisy or high-pitched sound with breathing)
wheezing
In adults, upper respiratory infections and bronchitis are the most common illnesses caused by HPIVs; signs and symptoms may include fever, runny nose, cough, and sore throat. Pneumonia may occur, especially in older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
You can have multiple HPIV illnesses in your lifetime.
When to seek emergency care
If your symptoms are severe or do not improve, you should seek medical attention.
Prevention
Currently, there is no vaccine to protect you against infection caused by HPIVs. However, researchers are trying to develop vaccines.
You may be able to reduce your risk of HPIV and other respiratory viral infections by taking everyday actions to help stop the spread of germs, like:
washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
avoiding close contact with people who are sick
Frequent hand washing is especially important in childcare settings.
Breastfeeding may protect babies from HPIVs during their first few months of life. That's because mothers may have antibodies (protective proteins) in their breast milk to fight infection.
If you are sick with a common cold illness or cough that may be caused by HPIV, you can help protect others by:
staying home while you are sick
avoiding close contact with others
covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
keeping objects and surfaces clean and disinfected
You may also consider wearing a well-fitted mask. Children ages 2 years and older can wear masks or respirators to protect themselves and others from HPIVs.
Treatment
There is no specific antiviral treatment for HPIV illness. Most people with HPIV illness will recover on their own. However, to relieve symptoms, you can:
take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and other over-the-counter medications for pain and fever (Caution: Aspirin should not be given to children.)
use a room humidifier or take a hot shower to help ease a sore throat and cough
People who are sick should:
drink plenty of liquids
stay home and rest
Antibiotics are not effective against HPIVs. Antibiotics are only effective against bacteria. For information about safe antibiotic use, see CDC's Antibiotic Prescribing and Use.
If you are concerned about you or your child's symptoms, you should contact your healthcare provider.
Scientific Integrity at CDC
Human Subjects Protection
KEY POINTS
All research involving human subjects by CDC complies with the HHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects.
All such research must be approved by an institutional review board (IRB) prior to the start of the research.
Staff are required to maintain competency in research ethics and human research regulations.
Overview
All research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must comply with the Health and Human Services (HHS) Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (45 CFR Part 46
). This includes research conducted by CDC employees or supported by CDC through funding or provision of other tangible support. It also applies whether research is conducted inside or outside the United States.
Unless exempt, all such research must be approved by an institutional review board (IRB) prior to the start of the research. CDC's Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) facilitates the work of the IRB. It also provides consultations and training for CDC staff engaged in research involving human subjects. Clinical investigations that involve the use of drugs, biologics, or devices—whether unlicensed or used outside standard medical practice—are subject to IRB review and approval under 21 CFR Part 50
and 21 CFR Part 56
.
CDC Institutional Review Boards
CDC has two Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), properly constituted in accordance with 45 CFR Part 46
and 21 CFR Part 56
:
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IRB
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—NIOSH IRB
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IRB
Based in Atlanta, Georgia, this IRB convenes monthly on the third Thursday of each month. Some adjustments may be made for federal holidays. The CDC IRB may convene on an ad hoc basis for urgent reviews. This IRB reviews protocols from all CDC Centers, Institutes, and Offices (with exception of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health).
Centers for Disease Control & Prevention—NIOSH IRB
Based in Cincinnati Ohio, this IRB reviews human research conducted or supported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. This board meets on the second Tuesday of each month and as needed for emergency situations.
Service on an IRB
IRB members serve for three years. They may serve longer at the discretion of the CDC Human Research Protection Office, the IRB chair, and the member. Service on an IRB is considered vital to the continuing research efforts of the agency and volunteers are always welcome.
The IRB chairs and vice-chairs collectively form the IRB Executive Committee. This committee meets as needed to discuss matters of common interest to the IRBs, to refine policy and practice, and to strive for reasonable consistency across the IRBs.
Training requirements for conducting research on human subjects at CDC
CDC investigators and scientific administrative staff involved in the conduct or oversight of federally funded human research are required to maintain competency in research ethics and human research regulations. This is done by completing specific trainings via the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)
prior to initiating activities. It is also required at certain intervals afterwards.
For partners working under an existing Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), CDC will continue to verify the active FWA.
Individual investigators not working under separate FWA (i.e., collaborating with CDC under an Individual Investigator Agreement) will be asked to submit proof of having completed human subject research training within the past 3 years.

Scientific Integrity at CDC
Human Subjects Protection
KEY POINTS
All research involving human subjects by CDC complies with the HHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects.
All such research must be approved by an institutional review board (IRB) prior to the start of the research.
Staff are required to maintain competency in research ethics and human research regulations.
Overview
All research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must comply with the Health and Human Services (HHS) Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (45 CFR Part 46
). This includes research conducted by CDC employees or supported by CDC through funding or provision of other tangible support. It also applies whether research is conducted inside or outside the United States.
Unless exempt, all such research must be approved by an institutional review board (IRB) prior to the start of the research. CDC's Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) facilitates the work of the IRB. It also provides consultations and training for CDC staff engaged in research involving human subjects. Clinical investigations that involve the use of drugs, biologics, or devices—whether unlicensed or used outside standard medical practice—are subject to IRB review and approval under 21 CFR Part 50
and 21 CFR Part 56
.
CDC Institutional Review Boards
CDC has two Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), properly constituted in accordance with 45 CFR Part 46
and 21 CFR Part 56
:
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IRB
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—NIOSH IRB
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention IRB
Based in Atlanta, Georgia, this IRB convenes monthly on the third Thursday of each month. Some adjustments may be made for federal holidays. The CDC IRB may convene on an ad hoc basis for urgent reviews. This IRB reviews protocols from all CDC Centers, Institutes, and Offices (with exception of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health).
Centers for Disease Control & Prevention—NIOSH IRB
Based in Cincinnati Ohio, this IRB reviews human research conducted or supported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. This board meets on the second Tuesday of each month and as needed for emergency situations.
Service on an IRB
IRB members serve for three years. They may serve longer at the discretion of the CDC Human Research Protection Office, the IRB chair, and the member. Service on an IRB is considered vital to the continuing research efforts of the agency and volunteers are always welcome.
The IRB chairs and vice-chairs collectively form the IRB Executive Committee. This committee meets as needed to discuss matters of common interest to the IRBs, to refine policy and practice, and to strive for reasonable consistency across the IRBs.
Training requirements for conducting research on human subjects at CDC
CDC investigators and scientific administrative staff involved in the conduct or oversight of federally funded human research are required to maintain competency in research ethics and human research regulations. This is done by completing specific trainings via the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)
prior to initiating activities. It is also required at certain intervals afterwards.
For partners working under an existing Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), CDC will continue to verify the active FWA.
Individual investigators not working under separate FWA (i.e., collaborating with CDC under an Individual Investigator Agreement) will be asked to submit proof of having completed human subject research training within the past 3 years.

Human Tapeworm (Taeniasis)
PARASITES 
About Human Tapeworm
KEY POINTS
Human tapeworm, or taeniasis, is a parasitic infection.
Most people with taeniasis have mild or no symptoms.
Human tapeworm is a different parasite than dog or cat tapeworm.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Taeniasis in humans is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm species Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), and Taenia asiatica (Asian tapeworm). Humans can become infected with these tapeworms by eating raw or undercooked beef (T. saginata) or pork (T. solium and T. asiatica). People with taeniasis may not know they have a tapeworm infection because symptoms are usually mild or nonexistent.
T. solium tapeworm infections can lead to cysticercosis, which is a disease that can cause seizures, so it is important seek treatment.
Species
Taeniasis in humans is a parasitic infection caused by these tapeworm species
Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm)
Taenia solium (pork tapeworm)
Taenia asiatica (Asian tapeworm)
Taenia saginata and T. solium are found worldwide. Infections with T. saginata occur wherever contaminated raw beef is eaten, particularly in Eastern Europe, Russia, eastern Africa and Latin America. Taeniasis due to T. saginata is rare in the United States, except in places where cattle and people are concentrated and sanitation is poor, such as around feed lots where cattle can be exposed to human feces. Tapeworm infections due to T. solium are more prevalent in under-developed communities with poor sanitation and where people eat raw or undercooked pork. Higher rates of illness have been seen in people in Latin America, Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia. Taenia solium taeniasis is seen in the United States, typically among Latin American immigrants. Taenia asiatica is limited to Asia and is seen mostly in the Republic of Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand.
Symptoms
Most people with tapeworm infections have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Patients with T. saginata taeniasis often experience more symptoms that those with T. solium or T. asiatica infections because the T. saginata tapeworm is larger in size (up to 10 meters (m)) than the other two tapeworms (usually 3 m). Tapeworms can cause digestive problems including abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, and upset stomach. The most visible sign of taeniasis is the active passing of proglottids (tapeworm segments) through the anus and in the feces. In rare cases, tapeworm segments become lodged in the appendix, or the bile and pancreatic ducts.
Be aware
Infection with T. solium tapeworms can result in human cysticercosis, which can be a very serious disease that can cause seizures and muscle or eye damage.
Taenia saginata does not cause cysticercosis in humans. It is not clear if T. asiatica causes cysticercosis in humans or not.
Causes and spread
Eating raw or undercooked contaminated beef or pork is the primary risk factor for acquiring taeniasis. Because of this, certain groups with dietary restrictions for these meats may have a lower risk of taeniasis.
A disease called cysticercosis can occur when T. solium tapeworm eggs are ingested. For example, people with poor hygiene who have taeniasis—with or without symptoms—will shed tapeworm eggs in their feces and might accidentally contaminate their environment. This can lead to transmission of cysticercosis to themselves or others unknowingly.
Prevention
One way to prevent taeniasis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. A food thermometer should be used to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is cooked. USDA recommends the following for meat preparation.
For Whole Cuts of Meat (excluding poultry)
Cook to at least 145° F (63° C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming.
For Ground Meat (excluding poultry)
Cook to at least 160° F (71° C); ground meats do not require a rest* time.
*According to USDA, ""A 'rest time' is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven, or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys pathogens.""
Resource
Cook to a Safe Minimum Internal Temperature | FoodSafety.gov
Testing and diagnosis
Diagnosis of Taenia tapeworm infections is made by examination of stool samples; individuals should also be asked if they have passed tapeworm segments. Stool specimens should be collected on three different days and examined in the lab for Taenia eggs using a microscope. Tapeworm eggs can be detected in the stool 2 – 3 months after the tapeworm infection is established.
Tapeworm eggs of T. solium can also infect humans, causing cysticercosis. It is important to diagnose and treat all tapeworm infections.
Treatment
Treatment is available after accurate diagnosis. Praziquantel is the drug of choice. Niclosamide is an alternative drug. See your healthcare provider for proper treatment and care.
Animal transmission
The tapeworm that your pet was diagnosed with is more than likely the flea tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum). Dog or cat tapeworm infections are a result of your pet swallowing a parasite-contaminated flea. Only in very rare instances do humans accidentally swallow the contaminated fleas.

Echinococcosis
PARASITES 
About Echinococcosis
KEY POINTS
Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with tiny tapeworms.
Echinococcosis is classified as either cystic echinococcosis or alveolar echinococcosis.
Each species causes different symptoms and spreads in different ways.
Species
Cystic echinocccosis
Cystic echinocccosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a ~ – 7 millimeter long tapeworm found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic, CE causes harmful, slowly enlarging cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs that often grow unnoticed and neglected for years.
Alveolar echinococcosis
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, a ~1 – 4 millimeter long tapeworm found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs (definitive hosts). Small rodents are intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis. Although cases of AE in animals in endemic areas are relatively common, human cases are rare. AE poses a much greater health threat to people than CE, causing parasitic tumors that can form in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, AE can be fatal.

Chemical Emergencies
Hydrogen Fluoride
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Hydrogen fluoride is a colorless gas or liquid that can cause severe damage to the body.
Signs and symptoms depend on the amount, how someone was exposed, and how long they were exposed.
Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed.
If swallowed, do not force vomiting. Do not take activated charcoal.
Background
Hydrogen fluoride is a chemical compound (made up of two or more elements) that has the element fluorine. It can be a colorless gas or a fuming liquid, which means it creates gas vapors.
It can also be dissolved in water. When hydrogen fluoride is dissolved in water, it may be called hydrofluoric acid.
Hydrogen fluoride can be made when other compounds with fluoride, such as ammonium fluoride, are mixed with water.
Where it is found
Hydrogen fluoride is used to make refrigerants (liquid used in refrigerators), herbicides, pharmaceuticals, high-octane gasoline, and fluorescent light bulbs. It is also used to make materials like aluminum, metals, plastics, etching glass, and electrical components.
60% of the hydrogen fluoride used in manufacturing is to make refrigerants.
How it works
Hydrogen fluoride goes easily and quickly through the skin and into the tissues in the body. When it touches tissues in the body, it damages the cells and causes them to not work properly.
Signs and symptoms
The effects of hydrogen fluoride poisoning depend on the amount, how someone was exposed, and how long they were exposed. It also depends on the person's age and if the person had any medical conditions.
Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to hydrogen fluoride. Other chemicals can also cause these effects.
Breathed in
Hydrogen fluoride gas, even at low levels, can irritate the eyes and respiratory tract (mouth, throat, lungs, nose). Breathing in hydrogen fluoride at high levels can cause death from an irregular heartbeat or from fluid buildup in the lungs.
Skin contact
Depending on the amount of hydrogen fluoride and how long it touches the skin, hydrogen fluoride may cause the following:
Severe pain at the point of contact
Rash
Deep, slow-healing burns
Even small splashes of high levels of hydrogen fluoride in it can lead to death.
Skin contact with hydrogen fluoride may not cause immediate pain or visible skin damage. Severe pain may be the only symptom for a few hours. Visible damage may not appear until 12 to 24 hours after the exposure.
Swallowed
Swallowing only a small amount of high levels of hydrogen fluoride will affect major internal organs and may lead to death.
Hydrogen fluoride exposure can also lead to severe electrolyte problems (not having enough or having too many minerals in your body).
If you're in immediate danger
Do not force vomiting. Do not take activated charcoal. Do not try CPR unless you can protect yourself from exposure.
Exposure
In a natural disaster, storage facilities or containers could be damaged and let out hydrogen fluoride. This could happen at an industrial site or even a retail location.
You could be exposed to hydrogen fluoride if it is used for chemical terrorism.
If you work in a job that uses hydrogen fluoride, you may be exposed in the workplace. You may also be exposed to hydrogen fluoride as part of a hobby.
What to do if you are exposed
Evacuate or shelter in place
Get fresh air by leaving the area where the hydrogen fluoride is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from hydrogen fluoride.
If hydrogen fluoride was released outside, move away from the area. If hydrogen fluoride was released indoors, get out of the building.
Emergency teams may tell you to evacuate or shelter in place.
Take off your clothes
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas and take off the clothes quickly.
Wash your body
As quickly as possible, wash any hydrogen fluoride from your skin with a lot of water.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where they are, use tongs, tool handles, or similar objects.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.
Seek medical attention immediately. Dial 911 and explain what has happened.
Keep Reading:
Responding to Chemical Emergencies
Treatment
Seek medical treatment as soon as possible if exposed.
Your doctor may recommend or use products to help lower the effects of poisoning. Gels, solutions, and medications with calcium gluconate (a calcium sugar) are used to treat hydrogen fluoride poisoning.
Long-term health effects
People who survive after being severely injured by breathing in hydrogen fluoride may suffer chronic (long-term) lung disease.
Skin damage caused by high levels of hydrogen fluoride may take a long time to heal and may cause severe scarring. Fingertip injuries from hydrogen fluoride may cause continuous pain, bone loss, and injury to the nail bed.
Eye exposure to hydrogen fluoride may cause long-term or permanent vision problems, blindness, or total break down of the eye.
Swallowing hydrogen fluoride can damage the esophagus (throat) and stomach. The damage may get worse for several weeks and cause the esophagus (throat) to slowly get smaller.

Chemical Emergencies
Cyanide
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Cyanide is a fast acting and potentially deadly chemical.
Signs and symptoms of ammonia exposure depend on how much you were exposed to.
Get away from the area, get clean, and get medical care if exposed.
Background
Cyanide is a fast acting and potentially deadly chemical that affects the body's ability to use oxygen.
It comes from natural substances in some foods and in certain plants, including the pits and seeds of some common fruits.
Cyanide is sometimes described as having a ""bitter almond"" smell. It does not always give off a smell, and not everyone can smell it.
Types
Gas or liquid
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) - also known as ""AC"" in the military
Cyanogen chloride (CNCI) - also known as ""CK"" in the military
Solid (crystal)
Sodium cyanide (NaCN)
Potassium cyanide (KCN)
Uses of cyanide
Making paper, textiles and plastics
Developing photographs
Metallurgy
Includes electroplating, metal cleaning and removing gold from its ore
Killing pests and vermin
Signs and symptoms
Breathing in cyanide gas causes symptoms to show up the fastest, but swallowing solid or liquid cyanide can be dangerous too.
These symptoms can happen during or right after someone is exposed:
Chest pain and/or chest tightness
Dizziness, weakness, and/or confusion
Eye pain and/or eye tearing
Excitement
Restlessness
Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath or wheezing
Rapid or slow breathing
Rapid or slow heart rate
Headache
Nausea and/or vomiting
If exposed to large amounts, signs and symptoms include:
Coma
Death
High or low blood pressure
Loss of consciousness
Lung injury
Seizures
These symptoms can happen very quickly when exposed to a large amount of cyanide. These symptoms can happen with any type of exposure (breathing in, skin or eye contact, or swallowing).
Exposure
Water
If cyanide is in the water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the water.
Air
If cyanide is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the cyanide gas. If solid cyanide is put into water, it can make hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN or AC). This can increase chances of breathing in the gas.
Cyanide gas is most dangerous in enclosed places where gas will be trapped. Cyanide gas can spread quickly in open spaces depending on the weather. less harmful outdoors.
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN or AC) gas is lighter than air, so the gas will rise. Cyanogen Chloride (CNCl or CK) is heavier and will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there.
Cyanide in food
Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with cyanide can expose people to cyanide. This is more likely to happen with solid cyanide.
Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched liquid cyanide if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an cyanide release. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the cyanide was released and breathe fresh air.
If the cyanide release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the cyanide does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the cyanide was released.
If the cyanide release was indoors, get out of the building.
Resource
Make sure you understand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency broadcasts and local authorities for instructions.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. Showering is the best method for removing cyanide from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take your clothes off
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will prevent the cyanide from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
If you were exposed to solid cyanide, skip this step and wash your body as described in the next section.
If you were exposed to any form except solid cyanide, follow these steps to blot your body:
Use dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Use a different cloth or towel for each body part.
Start blotting with your head and hair.
Then blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds.
Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch cyanide. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.
Get help
To get help right away:
Call 911.
Go to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave.
Call the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.
Treatment
The most important thing is for people to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.
If someone has swallowed cyanide, do not force vomiting.
Cyanide poisoning is treated with specific antidotes (treatment to reduce the effects of poison). Antidotes for cyanide poisoning are most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure.
It is also treated with supportive medical care in a hospital or by trained emergency personnel.
Long-term health effects
Survivors of large amounts of cyanide exposure may develop heart, brain, and nerve damage.

Global Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)
Global Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
KEY POINTS
Global access to safe water, sanitation, and proper hygiene education can reduce illness and death from disease, improve health, reduce poverty, and help economic growth.
Every year, diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid fever cause millions of illnesses and deaths, yet they can be prevented with better WASH practices.
Overview
Everyone needs clean water, safe toilets, and good hygiene habits to stay healthy, but not everyone has access to these essentials. Today, millions of people around the world do not have clean water to drink, and billions do not have a safe place to go to the bathroom. This can lead to serious illnesses like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, which are especially dangerous for infants and children.
Access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene remains a significant global challenge, with over 2 billion people
lacking clean drinking water at home, 1.5 billion lacking basic sanitation facilities, and 2 billion lacking basic hygiene services

Universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene has the potential to greatly reduce global disease burden. Investing in water and sanitation interventions brings economic, environmental, quality of life, and health benefits. WASH also plays a key role in improving nutritional outcomes, particularly among children.
Global impact of waterborne infections
Unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene play a major role in spreading diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. These conditions also contribute to the emergence of more dangerous forms of diseases, such as extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever. Addressing these challenges requires dedicated efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices. These improvements are necessary for preventing the spread of disease and dealing with emerging threats like antibiotic-resistant infections.
Harmful germs, parasites, or toxic chemicals can contaminate water. This contaminated water comes from human or animal waste, pesticides, and industrial waste. This can make people sick with diseases like cholera, typhoid, polio, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five years old. The primary risk factors for diarrhea include unsafe water and sanitation, along with childhood malnutrition.
In addition, not having access to clean water, toilets, and good hygiene practices makes it harder to stop and manage neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis, trachoma, and Guinea worm disease. This keeps the cycle of poverty and sickness going. Having reliable access to safe water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices significantly reduces the burden of disease globally.
Key facts highlight the impact of these conditions:
Diarrhea is a major cause of mortality among children under five, with about 88% of these deaths attributable to WASH issues.
Cholera affects 47 countries, primarily impacting vulnerable populations, with efforts focusing on improving WASH and vaccination to prevent outbreaks.
Typhoid fever, notably its drug-resistant strains, underscores the importance of enhanced sanitation, hygiene, and vaccination efforts for prevention.
Improving WASH infrastructure and practices is key to breaking the cycle of disease and poverty and highlights the need for global efforts to ensure everyone has access to safe water and sanitation.

Hymenolepiasis
PARASITES 
About Hymenolepiasis (Dwarf Tapeworm)
KEY POINTS
Hymenolepiasis is caused by a parasitic tapeworm, also known as the ""dwarf tapeworm.""
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
People can get dwarf tapeworm by consuming food or water contaminated by dwarf tapeworm eggs.
Dwarf tapeworm occurs worldwide, most often in people living in areas with poor sanitation and people living in institutional settings.
Overview
Dwarf tapeworm (i.e., Hymenolepis nana) is a type of parasitic tapeworm. The infection occurs worldwide.
Adult dwarf tapeworms are very small compared to other tapeworms. They can be anywhere from 15 – 40 mm (up to 2 in.) in length. The adult dwarf tapeworm consists of many small parts called ""proglottids."" When the dwarf tapeworm matures in the intestine, these proglottids break off and people pass them in their stool (poop).
Adult dwarf tapeworms can live for 4 – 6 weeks.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Hymenolepiasis (Dwarf Tapeworm) page.
Signs and symptoms
Most people infected with dwarf tapeworm do not have symptoms. When people do have symptoms, they can include one or more of the following:
Nausea
Weakness
Loss of appetite
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Children, especially those with heavy infections (a high number of tapeworms) can have the following symptoms:
Headache
Itchy bottom
Difficulty sleeping
At-risk populations
Dwarf tapeworm infections can occur worldwide. Infection is common among children, as well as people living in institutional settings, and those living in areas with unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact).
How it spreads
People can get dwarf tapeworm infection when they accidentally consume dwarf tapeworm eggs. This can happen when people consume fecal (poop) contaminated food or water, often when people touch their mouths with unclean hands or eating something with contaminated soil. People can also become infected if they accidentally consume an infected insect (an intermediate host, such as a small beetle or mealworm) that can contaminate food you eat.
People can spread the infection to others. Dwarf tapeworm eggs are infectious, which means they can re-infect you or infect others immediately after they are shed in feces (poop).
Prevention
To avoid getting dwarf tapeworm infection, people should take the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before preparing foods.
Teach children the importance of handwashing to prevent infection.
When traveling to countries where there is a higher risk of food contamination, wash, peel, or cook all raw vegetables and fruits with safe water (sanitized water, such as bottled, boiled, or filtered water) before eating.
See more on Handwashing.
Diagnosis
If you think you have dwarf tapeworm infection, see a healthcare provider.
Treatment and recovery
If diagnosed with dwarf tapeworm infection, a healthcare provider will treat you with praziquantel (the treatment of choice) or niclosamide or nitazoxanide (alternative drugs). These medications will cause the dwarf tapeworm to dissolve (break down) in the intestine. Depending on the infection, a person might have to have more than one treatment.
Niclosamide is not available in the US.
Myths and misconceptions
A dwarf tapeworm does not cause weight loss. You cannot feel the dwarf tapeworm inside your body.

Heat Health
About Heat and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Protect yourself and others when it's hot outside by staying cool, staying hydrated, and knowing the symptoms.
Hot days can affect anyone. If you are pregnant, are a child or teen with asthma, or have a heart condition or other chronic health conditions, heat can make your health worse.
Work with your doctor to create a Heat Action Plan
Stay Cool
If you are outside, especially for a long time, and the HeatRisk is red or above, you can:
Stay in the shade as much as possible
Take breaks when you can
Do outdoor activities during the coolest parts of the day or evening, if possible.
When you are indoors, you can:
Use fans, but only if indoor temperatures are less than 90°F. In temperatures above 90°F, a fan can increase body temperature.
Use air conditioning or find a location that has one by dialing 2-1-1, visiting the National Center for Healthy Housing's Cooling Centers by State
page, or by contacting your local health department or emergency management agency.
Check on your family, friends, and neighbors, especially if they have chronic medical problems or live alone. Check on pets.
Stay Hydrated
Drink plenty of fluids
Carry a water bottle. Drink and refill it throughout the day.
Consider limiting beverages high in sugars and sodium, caffeine, and alcohol, if possible.
Check your urine color. When it's light yellow or clear, it usually means you are drinking enough water.
Drinking water on hot days can help keep you hydrated, regardless of how active you are.
Know the Symptoms
If your body gets too hot, you can get sick. Know the symptoms of your body overheating and know when to seek medical care.
Symptoms can include:
Muscle cramping
Unusually heavy sweating
Shortness of breath
Dizziness
Headaches
Weakness
Nausea
Plus, check air quality levels – so you can plan your week with your health in mind.
Watch for symptoms of overheating when you’re outside on hot days.
Check your local HeatRisk and Air Quality
Enter your zip code on the CDC HeatRisk Dashboard for the heat risk forecast in your area and take recommended actions to protect your health.
Plus, check air quality levels – so you can plan your week with your health in mind.
Have a plan for your medicine
Many medicines can make you dehydrated or overheated on hot days. Also, some medicines need to be kept out of hot places.
Don't stop or change your medicines until you talk to your doctor.
Heat can cause power outages. Have a plan for what to do with refrigerated medications and electronic medical devices.
Store your medicines properly- some may need to be kept out of hot places.
For Those at High Risk
Although anyone at any time can suffer from heat-related illness, some people are at greater risk than others. Check on your family, friends, and neighbors, especially if they live alone or have chronic medical problems.
Some groups may have to take additional action on hot days, including:
People, especially children, with asthma
People with heart disease
Pregnant women
People 65 years of age or older
People who are working or exercising outside in the heat
Infants and young children
People over 65 years of age and young children may need to take additional actions on hot days.
Heart Disease, Family Health History, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia
About Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
KEY POINTS
If you have a family member who died suddenly before age 40, let your healthcare provider know.
You might need to be screened for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a genetic condition that causes the heart muscle to become thick and can lead to sudden death.
Finding HCM early can lead to better health outcomes.
What it is
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common genetic disorder that affects about 1 in 500 people1 and causes the heart muscle to become thicker and stiff.23 This makes it harder for the heart to work properly because
The thickened heart muscle can obstruct blood flow out of the heart.
The heart requires more energy and oxygen to work, especially during exercise.
The heart can hold less blood, so the amount of blood pumped to the rest of the body with each heartbeat is decreased.
Complications
People with HCM can develop complications such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia
, and ventricular fibrillation
.2 HCM can lead to sudden death, especially in children, teens, young adults, and competitive athletes, who may have no or few symptoms and not know they have a heart problem.24
HCM can develop at any point in a person’s life. Most people with HCM are born with what appears to be a normal heart and develop HCM later. Those who develop HCM before age 40 often have more symptoms and complications.5
People at risk
HCM sometimes runs in families. In such cases, a child of an affected parent has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of having HCM.6 Other family members also have an increased chance of having HCM. Importantly, the age at which other family members develop HCM can vary within families.
When collecting your family health history to assess your risk for HCM
Include information on family members who died suddenly, especially if they were younger than age 40.
Include information on family members with heart failure, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, stroke, heart attack, heart transplant, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)
, or pacemaker
.
Update information regularly, and let your healthcare provider know about any new diagnoses, cardiac events, or sudden deaths in your family.
Causes
HCM is caused by changes in genes that control the production of heart muscle proteins.6 You only need a change in one copy of the gene to develop HCM.
Testing and diagnosis
Genetic testing
If someone in your family has been diagnosed with HCM, that person can have genetic testing to look for genetic changes that cause HCM. Testing in your family should start with someone who has HCM. In cases in which a young person died suddenly, genetic testing might have been done as part of the autopsy.
Once the genetic change that causes HCM is found in a person, other family members can have genetic testing for that change. If genetic testing does not find a genetic change that causes HCM in the affected family member, they should follow up with their cardiologist (heart healthcare provider) on a regular basis. Sometimes genetic testing finds a genetic change that is not known to cause HCM at the time, but future studies show that it causes HCM. Also, further genetic testing might be recommended to include any newly identified genetic changes that cause HCM that were not included in earlier testing.
Diagnosis
If genetic testing shows that you have the genetic change for HCM, you will need to see a cardiologist to check your heart for signs of HCM. If the genetic change that causes HCM in your family is not known, parents, siblings, and children of the person with HCM will need to be checked for signs of HCM. Cardiologists can diagnose HCM using
Echocardiogram (Echo)
, which is non-invasive and uses sound waves to take pictures of your heart
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
, which is a non-invasive way to get detailed images of your heart
Know the symptoms
Knowing the symptoms of HCM is important if you have a family health history of HCM, especially if you have the genetic change for HCM that runs in your family. Even if you don’t have a family health history of HCM, tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the following common symptoms of HCM:
Feeling tired or lacking energy
Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity
Chest pain, especially with physical activity
Fainting or feeling dizzy or lightheaded
Swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, or stomach
Some people with HCM do not have symptoms in the early stages but develop them over time. Thus, even if you do not currently have signs or symptoms of HCM, you might need repeated monitoring based on your age and other factors if you have a family health history of HCM, especially if you have the genetic change for HCM that runs in your family.7 Let your healthcare provider know right away if you develop any of the symptoms of HCM.
What you can do
If you or your child has HCM, the healthcare provider may recommend
Regular monitoring: Adults need to see a cardiologist (heart healthcare provider) every 3-5 years to look for changes in the heart using echocardiogram, electrocardiogram (ECG), and checking for symptoms of HCM. For children and teens, the interval is every 1-3 years.6
Medication: Currently, no medicines have been proven to prevent HCM or lower the chances of dying. However, a variety of medicines can be used to treat symptoms of HCM. New drugs are currently being tested in clinical trials that may help patients with HCM.
Light to moderate physical activity: Light to moderate physical activity has been shown to help those with HCM. Those engaging in very high intensity activities such as competitive sports should discuss their risk with an HCM-trained specialist.
Surgery: Your healthcare provider might recommend surgery if you have severe HCM.
Controlling other chronic conditions: High blood pressure, sleep apnea
, and being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk of developing complications of HCM. Making lifestyle changes and taking other steps to manage these conditions are important for people with HCM.
While these steps cannot prevent HCM, they can help keep your heart as healthy as possible and decrease your likelihood of developing complications.
