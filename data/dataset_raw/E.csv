E-Cigarettes (Vapes)
AT A GLANCE
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are sometimes called e-cigs, vapes, vape pens, and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). E-cigarettes come in many shapes and sizes. Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine. Get the facts about e-cigarettes, their health effects, and the risks of vaping.
The bottom line
There are no safe tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.
E-cigarettes should not be used by youth, young adults, or women who are pregnant.
Adults who have never smoked or used other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, should not start.
E-cigarettes may have the potential to benefit adults who smoke and are not pregnant if they are used as a complete substitute for smoked tobacco products. However, no e-cigarette has been approved by the FDA as a smoking cessation aid.
More research is needed to better understand the short- and long-term health effects of using e-cigarettes as well as whether e-cigarettes can be effective at helping adults quit smoking.

KEY POINTS
E. coli are bacteria found in many places like the intestines of people and animals.
Most kinds of E. coli are harmless, but some can make you sick.
This site focuses on the kinds of E. coli that cause diarrhea.
Overview
E. coli are germs called bacteria. They are found in many places, including in the environment, foods, water, and the intestines of people and animals.
Most E. coli are harmless and are part of a healthy intestinal tract. E. coli help us digest food, produce vitamins, and protect us from harmful germs.

But some E. coli can make people sick with diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, sepsis, and other illnesses. This website focuses on the kinds of E. coli that cause diarrhea.
People can get infected after swallowing E. coli.
This can happen through contaminated food or water or contact with animals, environments, or other people.
Some people are more likely to get infected.
Groups of people who are at increased risk for E. coli infection include:
Children younger than 5
Adults 65 and older
People with weakened immune systems
International travelers
E. coli infection can be serious.
Infection with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) can lead to a serious health condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems, and even death.
E. coli infection can be prevented.
The good news is that you can take steps to help keep yourself and your family safe.

Ear Infection Basics
KEY POINTS
Is your child's ear hurting? It could be an ear infection.
Some ear infections, in particular some middle ear infections, need antibiotic treatment, but many can get better without antibiotics. Talk to your child's healthcare provider about the best treatment.
Overview
Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections. There are different types of ear infections.
Middle ear infection (acute otitis media) is an infection in the middle ear.
Otitis media with effusion is another condition that affects the middle ear.
Occurs when fluid builds up in the middle ear without causing an infection.
Does not cause fever, ear pain, or pus build-up in the middle ear.
Swimmer's ear is an infection in the outer ear canal.
Different from a middle ear infection.
For more information, visit ""Swimmer's Ear"" (Otitis Externa)
A healthy ear including outer, middle, and inner ear. An infected ear showing inflammation and fluid in the ear.
Signs and symptoms
Ear pain
Fever
Fussiness or irritability
Rubbing or tugging at an ear
Difficulty sleeping
Causes
Bacteria, like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (nontypeable), are the two most common bacteria causing middle ear infection.
Viruses, like those that cause colds can cause middle ear infection.
Prevention
Help prevent ear infections by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy:
Receive recommended vaccines, such as flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine.
Pneumococcal vaccine protects against a common cause of middle ear infections, Streptococcus pneumonia.
Clean your hands.
Breastfeed exclusively until your baby is 6 months old and continue to breastfeed for at least 12 months.
Don't smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.
Dry your ears thoroughly after swimming.
When to seek medical care
A fever of 102.2°F (39°C) or higher.
Pus, discharge, or fluid coming from the ear.
Worsening symptoms.
Symptoms of a middle ear infection that last for more than 2–3 days.
Hearing loss.
This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning.
Talk to a healthcare provider right away
If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.
Diagnosis
A healthcare provider can diagnose a middle ear infection by asking about symptoms and examining your child. They will look inside your child's ear to examine the eardrum and look for pus in the middle ear.
Treatment
Talk to your child's healthcare provider about the best treatment. The body's immune system can often fight off middle ear infection on its own.
Sometimes you do not need antibiotics for middle ear infections.
Severe middle ear infections or infections that last longer than 2–3 days need antibiotics right away.
For mild middle ear infection, your healthcare provider might recommend watchful waiting or delayed antibiotic prescribing.
Watchful waiting: Your child's healthcare provider may suggest watching and waiting for 2-3 days to see if your child needs antibiotics. This gives the immune system time to fight off the infection. If your child's symptoms don't improve, the healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic.
Delayed prescribing: Your child's healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic but suggest that you wait 2–3 days before filling the prescription. Your child may recover on their own and may not need the antibiotic.
How to feel better
Rest.
Drink extra water or other fluids.
Take over-the-counter medicines to relieve pain or fever.
These actions can make you feel better, even if you use antibiotics.
Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicines may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they will not cure your illness.
Over-the-counter medicine and children
Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Healthcare providers do not recommend some over-the-counter medicines for children of certain ages.
Pain relievers:
Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen.
Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain.
Cough and cold medicines:
Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children.
Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child's healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child.
Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking.

VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
APRIL 23, 2024
Ebola Disease Basics
KEY POINTS
Ebola disease is caused by an infection with an orthoebolavirus.
Orthoebolaviruses are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.
Orthoebolaviruses can cause serious and often deadly disease, with a mortality rate as high as 80 to 90 percent.
There is an FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus (species Zaire orthoebolavirus).
What it is
Ebola disease is caused by a group of viruses, known as orthoebolaviruses (formally ebolavirus)1. These viruses can cause serious illness that, without treatment, can cause death. Orthoebolaviruses were discovered in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.
Healthcare providers:
Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola disease, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC
Types
There are four orthoebolaviruses that cause illness in people:
Ebola virus (species orthoebolavirus zairense) causes Ebola virus disease.
Sudan virus (species orthoebolavirus sudanense) causes Sudan virus disease.
Taï Forest virus (species orthoebolavirus taiense) causes Taï Forest virus disease.
Bundibugyo virus (species orthoebolavirus bundibugyoense) causes Bundibugyo virus disease.
Some orthoebolaviruses do not cause illness in people. Reston virus (species Orthoebolavirus restonense) can cause illness in nonhuman primates and pigs. Bombali virus (species Orthoebolavirus bombaliense) was identified in bats, but scientists don't know if it causes illness in animals or people.
Signs and symptoms
People with Ebola disease may experience ""dry"" symptoms early in the course of illness. These symptoms may include fever, aches, pains, and fatigue. As the person becomes sicker, the illness typically progresses to ""wet"" symptoms and may include diarrhea, vomiting, and unexplained bleeding.
Keep Reading:
Signs and Symptoms of Ebola Disease
How long it takes for signs to show
Someone with Ebola disease may start getting sick 2 to 21 days after contact with an orthoebolavirus. However, on average, symptoms begin 8 to 10 days after exposure.
Risk factors
Healthcare providers and family members caring for someone with Ebola disease without proper infection control methods have the highest risk of infection.
The viruses that cause Ebola disease pose little risk to travelers or the general public.
How it spreads
People can get Ebola disease through contact with the body fluids of an infected sick or dead person. Rarely, some people can get the disease from contact with an infected animal, like a bat or primate.
Keep Reading:
How Ebola Disease Spreads
Prevention
When living in or traveling to regions where viruses that spread Ebola disease may be present, take steps to protect yourself.
Avoid contact with body fluids
Avoid contact with body fluids from people and animals, including
Blood and body fluids, like urine, feces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, semen, and vaginal fluid from people who are sick.
Semen from someone who has recovered from Ebola disease, until testing shows that the virus is no longer in the semen.
Clothes, bedding, needles, medical equipment, or other items that may have touched an infected person's blood or body fluids.
The body of someone who is suspected or confirmed to have had Ebola disease (such as during a funeral or burial practices).
Bats, forest antelopes, primates, and blood, fluids, or raw meat from these or unknown animals.
Wear protective equipment
Wear protective equipment if you come in contact with people who are sick or have died from Ebola disease, their blood and bodily fluids, or objects covered with their blood or body fluids.
Monitor your health
If you return from an area with an ongoing Ebola outbreak, monitor your health for 21 days. Seek medical care immediately if you develop symptoms of Ebola disease.
Ebola Vaccine
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ERVEBO® for the prevention of Ebola disease (species Orthoebolavirus zairense only). Vaccination is recommended for U.S. adults 18 years and older who are at potential risk of exposure to the Ebola virus. Ebola Vaccine Product Information
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to diagnose Ebola disease. They can also test for orthoebolavirus antibodies.
Someone being tested for Ebola disease should be separated from other people in a healthcare facility until results are confirmed.
Health Care Providers:
Clinical Guidance for Ebola Disease
Treatment
Two FDA-approved treatments2 are currently available to treat Ebola disease (species orthoebolavirus zairense): Inmazeb™
and Ebanga™
.
Supportive care:
Patients have a much better chance of surviving if they receive:
Fluids and electrolytes (body salts) by mouth or into their veins.
Medicine to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and to manage fever and pain.
Treatment for other infections, if they occur.

About Echinococcosis
KEY POINTS
Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with tiny tapeworms.
Echinococcosis is classified as either cystic echinococcosis or alveolar echinococcosis.
Each species causes different symptoms and spreads in different ways.
Species
Cystic echinocccosis
Cystic echinocccosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a ~ – 7 millimeter long tapeworm found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic, CE causes harmful, slowly enlarging cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs that often grow unnoticed and neglected for years.
Alveolar echinococcosis
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, a ~1 – 4 millimeter long tapeworm found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs (definitive hosts). Small rodents are intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis. Although cases of AE in animals in endemic areas are relatively common, human cases are rare. AE poses a much greater health threat to people than CE, causing parasitic tumors that can form in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, AE can be fatal.

Overview
Ehrlichiosis is the general name used to describe diseases caused by the bacteria Ehrlichia chaffeensis, E. ewingii, or E. muris eauclairensis in the United States. These bacteria are spread to people primarily through the bite of infected ticks including the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) and the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis).
People with ehrlichiosis will often have fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and sometimes upset stomach.
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for adults and children of all ages with ehrlichiosis.

About Abuse of Older Persons
KEY POINTS
Many older adults require care and are vulnerable to violence perpetrated by a caregiver or someone they trust.
More research is needed to uncover the causes for, and solutions to, violence against older adults.
What is older person abuse?
Older person abuse is an intentional act or failure to act that causes or creates a risk of harm to an older adult. An older adult is someone aged 60 or older.
The abuse occurs at the hands of a caregiver or other trusted person. Common types of abuse include:
Physical abuse is illness, injury, functional impairment, or death resulting from the intentional use of physical force. Examples include hitting, kicking, or pushing.
Sexual abuse is forced or unwanted sexual interaction. Examples include unwanted sexual contact or penetration or non-contact acts such as sexual harassment.
Emotional or psychological abuse refers to verbal or nonverbal behaviors that inflict anguish, fear, or distress. Examples include humiliation, threats, or harassment.
Neglect is the failure to meet an older adult's basic needs. These needs include food, water, shelter, clothing, hygiene, and essential medical care.
Financial abuse is the illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of money, benefits, property, or assets for the benefit of someone other than the older adult.
Quick facts and stats
The older adult population is growing faster in the U.S. than are younger populations. The data underestimate the problem because the number of nonfatal injuries is limited to older adults who are treated in emergency departments. The information doesn’t include those treated by other providers or those that do not need or do not seek treatment. Additionally, many cases are not reported because the older adult is afraid or unable to tell police, friends, or family about the violence.
Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 older adults who live at home.1 From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000 homicides occurred.2
Compared with women, men had higher rates of both nonfatal assaults and homicides.23 The rate for nonfatal assaults increased more than 75% among men (2002–2016) and more than 35% among women (2007–2016). The estimated homicide rate for men increased 7% from 2010 to 2016.2 Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black or African American persons, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanic or Latino persons have higher homicide rates (2002–2016).2
Overall and firearm-specific older adult homicide rates increased between 2014 and 2017. Of the 6,188 victims, 62% were male. The perpetrator was an intimate partner in 39% of firearm homicides and 12% of non-firearm homicides. Common contexts of firearm homicides were familial or intimate partner problems, robbery or burglary, argument, and illness-related (e.g. the homicide was perpetrated to end the suffering of an ill victim, both victim and perpetrator had an illness, or the perpetrator had a mental illness).3
The economic cost of violent injuries against older adults is also substantial. A recent CDC study found that assault injuries to older adults in the United States cost almost $33 billion in 2022. This reflects a rise in both homicides and nonfatal assaults treated in emergency departments among older adults. Specifically, the rate of nonfatal assaults increased by 31%, while the rate of homicides rose by 26% between 2015 and 2022. 4
Outcomes
Abuse can have several physical and emotional effects on an older adult. Victims are fearful and anxious. They may have problems with trust and be wary of others.5
Many victims suffer physical injuries. Some are minor, like cuts, scratches, bruises, and welts. Others are more serious and can cause lasting disabilities. These include head injuries, broken bones, constant physical pain, and soreness. Physical injuries can also lead to premature death and make existing health problems worse.35678
Prevention
Violence against older adults can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing abuse. Preventing violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them violence.
We can all help prevent violence against older adults:9
Listen to older adults to understand their challenges and provide support.
Educate yourself and others about how to recognize and report abuse.
Learn how the signs of abuse differ from the normal aging process.
Check-in on older adults who may have few friends and family members.
Encourage or assist persons (caregivers or older adults) who have problems with drugs or alcohol in getting help.
It is also possible to provide over-burdened caregivers with support. This can include help from friends, family, or local relief care groups, adult day care programs, or counseling.
Knowledge about what works to prevent violence against older adults is growing. However, most prevention strategies and practices have not yet been rigorously evaluated to determine their effectiveness. In the absence of proven prevention strategies, program planners may consider the following sources to strengthen their approach: Applying the Principles of Prevention: What do Prevention Practitioners Need to Know About What Works
and What Works in Prevention: Principles of Effective Prevention Programs

Electrical Safety in the Workplace
KEY POINTS
Only work on energized equipment or distribution systems if you are qualified and using appropriate PPE.
Understand approach distances from energized powerlines.
Make sure proper energy control procedures are used/followed and verify de-energization.
Why it's an issue
Many workers are unaware of the potential electrical hazards present in their work environment when completing tasks that involve electricity.
Electrical hazards
Electric shock and burns from contact with energized parts
Injury from exposure to arcing
Fire from faulty electrical equipment or installations
Arcing occurs when electricity jumps from one circuit to another.
Qualified vs. unqualified persons
Keep in mind
The only people that should do electrical work are qualified persons.
Qualified persons are trained to work on or near energized parts. They must have the skills and techniques necessary to distinguish exposed energized parts from other parts of electric equipment.
Qualified persons whose work on energized equipment involves direct contact or contact through tools or materials must also have training on appropriate PPE and electrical safety procedures.
Unqualified persons
Unqualified persons should not work on energized parts.
Unqualified persons should stay 10 feet away from energized parts.
Electrical injuries
Electrical injuries can be fatal. There are four main types of electrical injuries:
Electrocution (fatal)
Electric shock
Burns/Arc blast
Falls from height
Fatal falls from height commonly involve ladders and are caused from contact with overhead electrical lines.

E-Cigarettes (Vapes)
AT A GLANCE
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are sometimes called e-cigs, vapes, vape pens, and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). E-cigarettes come in many shapes and sizes. Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine. Get the facts about e-cigarettes, their health effects, and the risks of vaping.
The bottom line
There are no safe tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.
E-cigarettes should not be used by youth, young adults, or women who are pregnant.
Adults who have never smoked or used other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, should not start.
E-cigarettes may have the potential to benefit adults who smoke and are not pregnant if they are used as a complete substitute for smoked tobacco products. However, no e-cigarette has been approved by the FDA as a smoking cessation aid.
More research is needed to better understand the short- and long-term health effects of using e-cigarettes as well as whether e-cigarettes can be effective at helping adults quit smoking.
Empower Vape-Free Youth™
The Empower Vape-Free Youth™ campaign encourages middle and high school educators to speak with students about the risks of e-cigarettes and nicotine addiction.

Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR)
KEY POINTS
Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) is the transmission of digital laboratory reports from laboratories to healthcare and public health partners.
ELR automates the reporting process by translating information into an electronic message that can be automatically sent and processed.
ELR is important because it provides an essential tool in the response to outbreaks.
What is ELR?
Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) for public health is the transmission of digital laboratory reports, often from laboratories to state and local public health departments, healthcare systems, and CDC.
ELR is the transmission of digital laboratory reports between public health agencies.
How Does ELR Work?
The Process
When laboratory tests confirm infection with a reportable condition, such as measles, HIV, or rabies, information about the patient, specimen(s) collected, test(s), and result(s) are entered and stored securely in a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). LIMS is a software-based system that supports key laboratory functions like workflow, specimen and result tracking, and electronic data exchange with other parts of the healthcare and public health system. Information may be manually entered into the LIMS by laboratory personnel, or, in some cases, laboratory instruments may directly connect with the LIMS to automatically transfer the results into the system.
The information in the LIMS is used to create standardized electronic messages (such as HL7 v2.5.1 or other ELR formats) that can be processed and understood by other electronic systems. The tests and results may also be translated to standardized codes, such as Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)
.
After these electronic messages are created, they are sent from the laboratory to public health partners, like the state health department or CDC, through electronic data systems.
The public health agency receives the ELR messages and processes them into electronic systems that store information on reportable conditions. The ELR data can be linked with existing case reports or may be used to initiate a new report, enhancing data sharing between epidemiology and laboratory programs.
Depending on the condition, the state or local health department may reach out to the patient or healthcare system to perform a case interview, initiate contact tracing, release medical countermeasures from the Strategic National Stockpile, or take other public health action.
Why is ELR Important?
ELR and Outbreak Preparedness
ELR provides an essential tool in the response to outbreaks. Outbreaks can be identified more quickly and managed more effectively with quickly delivered, high-quality ELR data. This allows health departments to leverage health information systems to inform response activities.
ELR provides an essential tool in disease outbreak response.
ELR Improves Laboratory Report Quality
Receiving timely, accurate, complete, and consistent laboratory report data can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public health responses to outbreaks and cases of state reportable conditions. Using standardized formats promotes interoperability and improves exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of data. Data improvements include:
Faster electronic transmission
Increased accuracy by reduction of manual data entry errors
More complete reports
Improved consistency across various data sources
ELR Foundations Strengthen COVID-19 Laboratory Reporting
As early as 2005, CDC, in partnership with the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL)
, began paving the way for what is now the COVID-19 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (CELR) program. In 2009, APHL created a secure, cloud-based platform to help state health departments, state laboratories, regional commercial laboratories, and federal agencies report their data. State health departments have increasingly used this platform, supported by ongoing financial and technical support from CDC, to increase the reportable disease results shared with CDC.
The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated timely access and dissemination of de-identified electronic healthcare data to guide the domestic response. Previous investments CDC made into reporting systems infrastructure allowed the CELR program to quickly enable detailed data reporting from public health departments to CDC for approximately 90 percent of the COVID-19 testing volume conducted nationwide. This robust dataset informs public health decision-making to help reduce disease in communities.

About Elizabethkingia
KEY POINTS
Elizabethkingia bacteria are found worldwide in water sources but rarely make people sick.
When they do infect people, they can cause serious illness and sometimes death.
Those at highest risk are the very young or those with weakened immune systems.
Elizabethkingia infection is often resistant to antibiotics.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Elizabethkingia is a family of bacteria found worldwide in the environment (soil, river water and water sources like plumbing and drains). Despite how common the bacteria are, they usually don't make people sick.
In the United States, about 5-10 cases per state are reported each year. This averages to 250-500 infections nationally per year. Most infections occur in small outbreaks in health care facilities in people who have pre-existing health conditions.
The illness can kill between one-third and half of patients who get it. This is likely due to two factors; one is that Elizabethkingia infection can be severe. The other is that most people with Elizabethkingia are already medically fragile before they get the infection.
Signs and symptoms
Elizabethkingia infection signs and symptoms vary. The most common symptom is blood infections without an obvious source. Meningitis (swelling of the brain and nervous system) is common. It is linked to high numbers of illnesses and deaths in children who get sick with the disease.
It can also cause:
Pneumonia and/or bronchitis (lung or airway infections)
Swelling of the heart (endocarditis)
Skin and soft tissue infection
Urinary tract infections
Bone infections
Bloodstream infections
Infections at surgery sites
Who's affected
Healthy people are rarely affected by Elizabethkingia.
Those at highest risk for infections are:
Babies born before 37 weeks gestation
Those with weakened immune systems
People in critical care units in healthcare facilities.
Testing
Testing is done by culture (growing the bacteria in blood samples in the lab). CDC provides testing to determine the type of Elizabethkingia bacteria a person may be infected with.
CDC can also assess if an illness is part of an outbreak, either in the community or a healthcare facility. This can help healthcare providers be on the lookout for additional cases and respond if other people get ill.
Treatment and recovery
Elizabethkingia bacteria are naturally resistant to many commonly used antibiotics.
Healthcare providers can send samples to CDC for Elizabethkingia testing to determine which antibiotics may be most effective.
Between one-third and half of patients recover from Elizabethkingia infection.

Children are different
Children's bodies are different from adults' bodies
They are more likely to get sick or severely injured.
They breathe in more air per pound of body weight than adults.
They have thinner skin, and more of it per pound of body weight (higher surface-to-mass ratio).
They have less fluid in their bodies, so fluid loss (e.g. dehydration, blood loss) can have a bigger effect on children.
They are more likely to lose too much body heat.
They spend more time outside and on the ground.
They put their hands in their mouths more often than adults.
Children in an emergency
Children need help from adults in an emergency
Children don't fully understand how to keep themselves safe.
Older children and adolescents may take their cues from others.
Young children may cry, scream, or become paralyzed with fear.
They may not be able to explain what hurts or bothers them.
They are more likely to get the care they need when they have parents or other caregivers around.
Adults are required by law to make medical decisions for a child.
Adults will sometimes have to make decisions with limited information on the ways some illnesses and medicines affect children.
Children's mental health
Mental stress from a disaster can be harder on children
They feel less of a sense of control.
They understand less about the situation.
They have fewer experiences bouncing back from hard situations.
Resources
Disasters can strike without any warning. Family members may not all be in the same place.
It's important to make a plan so everyone will know what to do.

Protecting Emergency Response and Recovery Workers
WHAT TO KNOW
Emergency response and recovery workers are a common denominator at any disaster or novel emergency event.
It is critical to protect emergency response and recovery workers' safety and health throughout an emergency.
Response leaders can use these recommendations to help prevent illnesses, injuries, and fatalities during an emergency.
Overview
Preparedness and response activities should address workers' safety and health during all emergency stages, including before, during, and after an event. This helps to ensure that only qualified, trained, and properly equipped personnel are deployed.
Recommendations
Safety managers, incident command leaders, employers, and other disaster site leaders
Information on potential hazards present or expected at a disaster scene helps to establish necessary safety measures. Safety measures are critical to prevent hazards and reduce potential harmful incidents that can occur at the worksite. Examples of safety measures are described below:
Establish a system to manage personnel during an emergency
Provide training to face a particular hazard
Define the use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
Install guidelines and mechanisms to be used in case of an emergency
The Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance (ERHMS) framework provides recommendations for protecting emergency response and recovery workers. Anyone involved in deploying and protecting emergency response and recovery workers can use the framework. ERHMS includes recommendations for all phases of a response, including:
Pre-Deployment
Deployment
Post-Deployment
Recommendations for people responding to disasters and large-scale incidents are described in a series of reports called Protecting Emergency Responders:

Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance
KEY POINTS
The Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance (ERHMS) framework provides recommendations for protecting emergency response and recovery workers.
ERHMS includes recommendations for all phases of a response, including pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment.
Anyone involved in deploying and protecting emergency response and recovery workers can use the framework.
Why it's important
There are significant gaps and deficiencies in health monitoring and surveillance of emergency response and recovery workers. Examples of these workers include:
Police
Firefighters
Emergency medical personnel
Cleanup, repair, restoration, and recovery workers
Volunteers
Emergency response and recovery workers must be protected from hazardous conditions when responding to disasters and other emergencies. A plan for health monitoring and surveillance is essential to their health and safety.
Recognizing this, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) worked with partners to develop the ERHMS framework. Partners include the U.S. National Response Team and several federal agencies, state health departments, labor unions, and volunteer emergency responder groups.

Protecting Emergency Response and Recovery Workers
WHAT TO KNOW
Emergency response and recovery workers are a common denominator at any disaster or novel emergency event.
It is critical to protect emergency response and recovery workers' safety and health throughout an emergency.
Response leaders can use these recommendations to help prevent illnesses, injuries, and fatalities during an emergency.
Overview
Preparedness and response activities should address workers' safety and health during all emergency stages, including before, during, and after an event. This helps to ensure that only qualified, trained, and properly equipped personnel are deployed.
Recommendations
Safety managers, incident command leaders, employers, and other disaster site leaders
Information on potential hazards present or expected at a disaster scene helps to establish necessary safety measures. Safety measures are critical to prevent hazards and reduce potential harmful incidents that can occur at the worksite. Examples of safety measures are described below:
Establish a system to manage personnel during an emergency
Provide training to face a particular hazard
Define the use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
Install guidelines and mechanisms to be used in case of an emergency
The Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance (ERHMS) framework provides recommendations for protecting emergency response and recovery workers. Anyone involved in deploying and protecting emergency response and recovery workers can use the framework. ERHMS includes recommendations for all phases of a response, including:
Pre-Deployment
Deployment
Post-Deployment
Recommendations for people responding to disasters and large-scale incidents are described in a series of reports called Protecting Emergency Responders:

Guidelines for Personal Hygiene During an Emergency
AT A GLANCE
Good personal hygiene and handwashing are critical to help prevent the spread of illness and disease. Sanitation and hygiene become especially important during an emergency, such as a natural disaster, when finding clean, safe water could be difficult.
Learn about important cleanliness tips to keep yourself and loved ones healthy during an emergency.
Wash your hands to prevent the spread of germs
Keep hands clean to help prevent the spread of germs.
Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially during key times when you are most likely to spread germs. Follow CDC's five easy steps to make sure you are washing your hands the right way.
Wash your hands with soap and water that has been boiled or disinfected if local authorities or your doctor recommend extra caution.
During a boil water advisory or ""do not drink water"" advisory, it may be safe to wash hands with tap water.
If clean tap water is not available, create a temporary handwashing station
by using a large water jug.
If you do not have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
If soap and water are not available...
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. However, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs and might not remove harmful chemicals. Hand sanitizers are not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy.
Follow local guidance on water that is safe for bathing
If you are using municipal water, listen to your local health and drinking water authorities for guidance on whether you can bathe or shower after a water-related emergency. Sometimes water that is not safe to drink can be used for bathing, but be careful not to swallow any water or get it in your eyes.
Do not bathe:
In water that may be contaminated with sewage or toxic chemicals.
In rivers, streams, or lakes that are contaminated by flood water, human sewage, or animal waste.
If you have a drinking water well, listen to your local health authorities for advice on using well water for showering and bathing. If extensive flooding has occurred or you suspect your well may be contaminated, contact your local, state, or tribal health department for specific advice on well testing and disinfection.
Use only clean water to brush your teeth
Use only clean water to brush your teeth after a water-related emergency. Listen to local authorities to find out if tap water is safe to use.
Find information about preparing a home water supply and making your water safe for brushing your teeth.
Visit CDC's Oral Health website for information on caring for your teeth.
Keep wounds clean and covered
Keeping wounds clean and covered is crucial during an emergency. Open wounds and rashes that have been exposed to contaminated water can become infected. Naturally occurring bacteria such as Vibrio that live in certain coastal waters can also cause a skin infection when an open wound is exposed to salt water or brackish water. Brackish water is a mix of salt and fresh water often found where rivers meet the sea.
To protect yourself and your family:
Avoid contact with flood waters, salt water, or brackish water if you have an open wound (including cuts and scrapes).
Keep open wounds as clean as possible by washing well with soap and clean water.
Cover clean, open wounds with a waterproof bandage to reduce your chance of infection.
Seek immediate medical care if a wound develops redness, swelling, or oozing.
Follow guidelines for safe diapering
It's always important to change diapers in a safe, germ-free way, but an emergency can make this difficult. Even a microscopic amount of poop can contain millions of germs. CDC has guidelines and checklists to help parents, childcare providers, emergency responders, and others learn how to practice safe and germ-free diaper changing in emergency situations.

Emerging Infections Program
AT A GLANCE
The Emerging Infections Program (EIP) supports state-level efforts to track, prevent, and report on emerging infectious diseases.
EIP sites produce timely, actionable surveillance and evaluation data to inform policy and public health practice.
Overview
The Emerging Infections Program (EIP) is a network of 12 US sites working to translate infectious disease research into informed policy and public health practice. Each network site is a collaboration between state health departments, academic institutions, and other key public health partners.
EIP sites collect extensive data on disease characteristics and risk factors, including variables not collected through standardized reporting, such as underlying medical conditions, clinical course, outcomes, and vaccination status. EIP sites also investigate causes of infectious disease outbreaks, evaluate effectiveness of interventions, and promote prevention.
The EIP network can be leveraged in emergencies to rapidly scale up surveillance of emerging infectious diseases and inform quick decision making. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EIP sites worked together to collect extensive data on hospitalized patients, including those first affected. This work described disease trends among adults and children, highlighted differences in hospitalization rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and informed recommendations on strategies to prevent infection.
EIP sites rely on robust and integrated data reporting and sharing systems. CDC aims to strengthen these systems through targeted investments in data modernization. These efforts will improve sites' ability to collect, manage, and share public health data.
Why it matters
For almost 30 years, the EIP network has produced and shared timely, actionable surveillance and research on emerging infectious diseases. For example, EIP work has been instrumental in:
providing assessments for disease severity and national disease burden estimates for respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
evaluating and honing strategies for preventing severe disease in newborns caused by Group B Streptococcus,
determining the burden of foodborne illnesses in the United States and monitoring trends in these pathogens over time,
providing estimates of SARS-CoV-2- and influenza-associated hospitalizations to inform public health policy,
characterizing hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 and influenza cases to investigate vaccine impact, and
defining the national burden of healthcare-associated infections in hospitals and identifying priorities for surveillance and prevention.

About Tick-borne Encephalitis
KEY POINTS
Tick-borne encephalitis virus is mainly spread through the bite of an infected tick.
Tick-borne encephalitis is not found in the United States.
Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and weakness.
Disease can be severe.
A vaccine for tick-borne encephalitis is available and is recommended for some travelers.
Overview
Tick-borne encephalitis virus is spread through the bite of an infected tick. Occasionally, tick-borne encephalitis virus can spread to people through eating or drinking raw milk or cheese from infected goats, sheep, or cows.
Tick-borne encephalitis virus can be found in parts of the region stretching from western and northern Europe to northern and eastern Asia. People who travel to these areas might be at risk for infection. Tick-borne encephalitis virus is not found in the United States. The ticks that spread tick-borne encephalitis virus are most active in warmer months (April through November). People who spend time outdoors in or near forests are at highest risk of being bitten by a tick infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus.
Many people infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus do not have symptoms. Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and weakness. Severe disease often occurs including inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).
There are no medications to treat tick-borne encephalitis. A vaccine for tick-borne encephalitis is available and might be recommended for some U.S. travelers who are visiting parts of Europe and Asia where tick-borne encephalitis is found and who might be at risk of exposure to ticks while participating in outdoor activities. You also can reduce your risk of infection from tick-borne encephalitis virus by avoiding ticks.

FUNGAL DISEASES
APRIL 24, 2024
Fungal Eye Infections Basics
KEY POINTS
Fungal eye infections are extremely rare but can be very serious.
Most fungal eye infections occur from eye injuries.
Eye surgeries and bloodstream infections can also cause fungal eye infections.
Fungal eye infections are treated with prescription antifungal medications.
Overview
Medical illustration of Fusarium, a fungus that causes eye infections.
Eye infections can be caused by many different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, amoeba, and fungi. Eye infections caused by fungi are extremely rare but can be very serious.
Types
There are two main types of fungal eye infections, depending on the part of the eye that is infected. Many types of fungi can cause eye infections.
Types of infections
The two types of fungal eye infections are keratitis and endophthalmitis. Keratitis is an infection of the clear, front layer of the eye (the cornea). Endophthalmitis is an infection of the inside of the eye (the vitreous and/or aqueous humor).
Endophthalmitis can occur two different ways. Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs after fungal spores enter the eye from an external source. Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs when a bloodstream infection (for example, candidemia) spreads to one or both eyes.
Many types of fungi can cause infections.
Fusarium –lives in the environment, especially in soil and on plants.
Aspergillus – common mold foundi n indoor and outdoor environments.
Candida – a type of yeast that normally lives in and on the body.
Symptoms
The symptoms of a fungal eye infection can show up anytime from several days to several weeks after an exposure. Fungal eye infection symptoms are similar to those of other types of eye infections, like those caused by bacteria.
Symptoms can include:
Eye pain
Eye redness
Blurred vision
Sensitivity to light
Excessive tearing
Eye discharge
Causes
A fungal eye infection can be caused by:
Eye injury, especially with plant material (i.e., thorns or sticks).
Eye surgery or invasive eye procedures.
Contaminated medical products are a potential risk factor.
Chronic eye disease involving the surface of the eye.
Wearing contact lenses.
Fungal bloodstream infection (like candidemia).
Risk factors:
People who have diabetes, a weakened immune system, or use corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory steroids) have a higher risk of fungal eye infections. Fungal keratitis may be more common among people living in rural areas.
Eye infections can occur after eye surgery.
Prevention
Wearing eye protection when outside can help prevent fungal eye infections caused by eye injuries that involve plant material. For many activities, wearing sunglasses can offer some protection. Outdoor workers and farmworkers should wear appropriate protective eyewear.
People who wear contact lenses should care for their lenses properly. Learn more about how to protect your eyes while wearing contacts.
If you think you have an eye infection it is important to see a healthcare provider or eye doctor right away.
Diagnosis
An eye doctor can examine your eye and test for infection.
The most common way to diagnose a fungal eye infection is done by a doctor collecting a sample of tissue or fluid from the eye. The sample is sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope or cultured.
Polymerase chain reaction and confocal microscopy, a type of optical imaging, are also being used as newer, faster forms of diagnosis.
Treatment and recovery
The treatment for a fungal eye infection depends on the type of fungus, the severity of the infection, and the parts of the eye that are affected. Possible forms of treatment for fungal eye infections include:
Antifungal eye drops.
Antifungal medication given as a pill.
Antifungal medication injected.
Eye surgery may be needed if infections do not get better after using antifungal medications.

Directory of Engineering Controls
Print
Engineering controls protect workers by removing hazardous conditions or by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard. Examples include local exhaust ventilation to capture and remove airborne emissions or machine guards to shield the worker. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions. They typically do not interfere with worker productivity or personal comfort and make the work easier to perform rather than more difficult. The initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than some other control methods, but over the longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide a cost savings in other areas of the process. To learn more about how engineering controls fit into the strategy for reducing and/or eliminating occupational hazards, visit our hierarchy of controls website.
NIOSH researchers help prevent occupational disease and injury by conducting engineering control technology evaluations and developing practical, solutions-oriented control technology interventions. To conduct these efforts, NIOSH works collaboratively with partners both in the United States and around the world.
This directory page links to NIOSH engineering control related webpages, projects, programs, tools and resources created to improve workplace health and safety.
NIOSH researchers reduce the risk of silicosis and other lung diseases for workers fabricating stone countertops by evaluating engineering control measures such as optimized ventilation through dust extractors, and providing recommendations to partners including OSHA, state agencies, industrial partners, and labor unions.

Amebiasis
EXPLORE TOPICS

MAY 2, 2024
About Amebiasis
KEY POINTS
Amebiasis is a disease caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
Amebiasis is more common in people living in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions or people traveling to these areas.
Antibiotics are effective in treating amebiasis.
Overview
Entamoeba histolytica amebas in a person's small intestine.
Amebiasis is caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, or E. histolytica. Anyone can get amebiasis. It is more common if you live in a tropical area with poor sanitary conditions or travel to one of these areas.
If you think you have amebiasis, see your healthcare provider. The disease can be difficult to diagnose. Most people with amebiasis don't get very sick. Everyone with amebiasis should receive medications to treat the infection.
Signs and symptoms
Only about 10% to 20% of people infected with E. histolytica become ill. Even then, symptoms are often mild. They can include diarrhea, stomach pain, and stomach cramping. Symptoms usually develop within 2 to 4 weeks but can show up later.
A severe form of amebiasis called amebic dysentery can cause stomach pain, bloody poop, and fever.
Rarely, E. histolytica travels through the blood stream to the liver and forms an abscess (collection of pus). In a small number of instances, the parasite has spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs and brain.
Risk factors
In the United States, amebiasis is most common in:
People who traveled to tropical places with poor sanitary conditions
Immigrants from tropical countries with poor sanitary conditions
People who live in facilities with poor sanitary conditions
People who have anal sex
Causes
You can get amebiasis if you:
Swallow something such as water or food contaminated with E. histolytica
Put something in your mouth that has touched the poop of someone infected with E. histolytica
Swallow E. histolytica  germs picked up from a contaminated surface or your fingers
Prevention
Washing your hands thoroughly can help prevent spreading amebiasis.
You can spread amebiasis to others. The risk is low if you get treated with antibiotics and practice good hygiene. This includes thoroughly washing your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom or changing diapers. You should also wash your hands before handling or preparing food or drinks.
If in an area with poor sanitary conditions:
Don't eat or drink:
Fountain drinks or any drinks with ice cubes
Fresh fruit or vegetables you didn't peel yourself
Milk, cheese, and dairy products that may not have been pasteurized
Food or drinks sold by street vendors
It is safe to drink:
Bottled water with an unbroken seal
Carbonated (bubbly) water from sealed cans or bottles
Carbonated drinks like soda from sealed cans or bottles
Tap water that has been boiled for at least 1 minute
You also can make tap water safe to drink by first filtering it through an ""absolute 1 micron or less"" filter. Then dissolve chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or iodine tablets in the filtered water.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider will ask for a sample of your poop. You may be asked for several samples from different days. This is because E. histolytica is not always found in every sample.
Diagnosing amebiasis can be very difficult. Other parasites and cells can look very similar to E. histolytica under a microscope.
If you've been told that you have an E. histolytica infection but you're feeling fine, you might be infected with a different parasite, Entamoeba dispar, or E. dispar. It is about 10 times more common worldwide. E. dispar doesn't make people sick and doesn't need to be treated.
Some laboratories, including CDC, have tests that can tell if a person is infected with E. histolytica or E. dispar. Fluid from liver abscesses can also be tested for E. histolytica.
Treatment and recovery
A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat amebiasis. You will take one antibiotic if you're not feeling sick. If you are sick, you'll probably be prescribed a second antibiotic to take after you've finished the first.

MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Enterobacterales are a group of bacteria (germs) that are a normal part of the human and animal gut but can also cause infections. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are germs resistant to one or several antibiotics called carbapenems.
In 2017, CRE caused about 13,100 infections in hospital patients and about 1,100 deaths in the United States.1
Types
CRE can include germs like Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) if they develop resistance to carbapenems.
Signs and symptoms
Pneumonia
Bloodstream infections
Urinary tract infections
Wound infections
Meningitis
Who is at risk
Patients in healthcare settings are at most risk for CRE, especially those who:
Require devices like ventilators (breathing machines), urinary (bladder) catheters, or intravenous (vein) catheters.
Are taking long courses of certain antibiotics.
Have weakened immune systems.
Healthy people usually do not get CRE infections.
How it spreads
Person-to-person contact from dirty hands, wounds, or stool (poop).
Contaminated medical equipment and devices.
A few reports described spread between animals and humans and animal-to-animal spread.
In some cases, people or animals can carry the germs on or in their body without being infected, known as colonization.
Reducing risk
Take antibiotics exactly as your healthcare provider recommends.
Follow patient safety tips in healthcare settings.
Keep your hands clean.
Treatment and recovery
CRE infections are difficult to treat. They are resistant to most antibiotics, including carbapenems, drugs often used to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Healthcare providers make treatment decisions for CRE infections on a case-by-case basis. If your provider prescribes antibiotics, take them exactly as instructed and finish the full course, even if you feel better.
Colonized patients often do not require treatment.
Animal impact
Animals can get CRE from many sources, including colonized people or animals. The risk of pet owners getting CRE from their pet is low.
Scientists are still working to understand how long animals carry CRE, but they may carry it longer if they are exposed or if they receive antibiotics.1
Talk to your veterinarian about CRE and if your pet has a history of CRE.

APRIL 11, 2024
About ESBL-producing Enterobacterales
KEY POINTS
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales are resistant to common antibiotics and may require complex treatments.
Infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales can occur both in and outside of healthcare settings.
Good hand hygiene and infection prevention practices can help reduce infection risk.
Overview
Enterobacterales are a group of bacteria that cause infections in healthcare settings and communities.
Some species are also a normal part of the human gut.
Some Enterobacterales produce enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs).
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) break down certain antibiotics, making some infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales difficult to treat.
Types
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales include germs like Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae).
In 2017, there were an estimated 197,400 cases of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales among hospitalized patients and 9,100 estimated deaths in the United States.
Signs and symptoms
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales can cause several different infections, including urinary tract and bloodstream infections. These bacteria can also live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, known as colonization.
Who is at risk
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections occur in healthcare settings like hospitals and nursing homes. These infections may also occur in healthy people.
After traveling abroad to places where these germs originate, people returning to the United States are at increased risk.
How it spreads
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales can spread from person to person through dirty hands and surfaces.
Outside the United States, they can spread through contaminated food or water. The role of food and water in the spread of these germs in the United States is not clear.
Reducing risk
Patients and caregivers should:
Wash their hands often with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Wash their hands after using the bathroom and before eating or preparing food.
Remind people (including healthcare staff) to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
Follow recommended practices for food and water safety when traveling abroad.
Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Treatment and recovery
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections are resistant to many prescribed antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. These infections might require hospitalization and intravenous (IV) antibiotics.
Carbapenems are often used to treat serious ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections, but resistance is on the rise for them, too. The more we rely on this important class of antibiotics, the greater the risk of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE).
What CDC is doing
Tracking ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales and slow the spread of resistant germs.

PARASITES 
SEPTEMBER 9, 2024
About Pinworm Infection
KEY POINTS
Pinworm infection is caused by small, thin, white parasitic roundworms.
Anyone can get pinworm infection, but it primarily affects children, people in long-term care facilities, and household members and caretakers of persons with pinworm infections.
Medication, handwashing, and good hygiene are the best ways to stop the spread of pinworm.
Overview
Pinworms are a type of parasitic roundworm that can infect your intestines. Parasites are organisms (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Pinworm infection causes itching around the anus (butthole). Anyone can get a pinworm infection, but it usually affects children, people living with or caring for children, and people living in long-term care facilities or institutional settings. Pinworm infection is preventable and treatable.
On average, a single pinworm is about the size of a staple. The scientific name for a pinworm is Enterobius vermicularis and some healthcare providers may use the terms enterobiasis or oxyuriasis to refer to pinworm infection.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of pinworm infection are usually mild, and some people have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, it is typically itching around the anus. Female pinworms lay their eggs at night on the skin around the anus, which can cause the skin to itch. Some infected people have difficulty sleeping or restlessness. Some infected people have reported abdominal pain. Occasionally, pinworms can move to the vaginal area, causing irritation and inflammation. Repeated scratching can make the skin red and puffy and lead to bacterial skin infections—in addition to the pinworm infection.
Risk factors
Pinworm infection occurs worldwide. Pinworms can infect anyone, in any setting, and are the most common worm infection in the United States. Pinworm infection occurs most commonly among
School-aged and preschool-aged children,
People in institutional settings, and
Household members and caretakers of people with pinworm infection.
Pinworm infections often occur in more than one person in a household. It is common to see multiple infections in institutional and childcare settings as pinworms spread easily.
How it spreads
While an infected person sleeps, female pinworms leave the intestine through the anus and deposit their eggs on the surrounding skin. Two to three hours after pinworms lay their eggs, the eggs become capable of infecting other people who accidentally swallow them. The eggs can easily infect another person, especially caretakers or close contacts of infected children or adults:
If, after they touch an infected area around the anus, or get eggs under their fingernails, they then touch their mouth.
After pinworm eggs get onto diapers, clothes, bedding, food, or other items, the worms could then make it from the object to someone's mouth. (If not properly washed or cleaned, pinworm eggs can survive 2 – 3 weeks on objects.)
When pinworm eggs, which are tiny, float through the air and someone breaths them in then swallows them (rare).
Prevention
Washing your hands with soap and warm water is the best way to prevent pinworm infection. This is especially important after
Using the toilet
Changing diapers, and
Touching people who have pinworm or handling items they have used.
Always wash your hands before handling food. Teach children the importance of washing their hands thoroughly and often.
Repeated infections are common. Treat everyone—people infected with pinworms, their caretakers, and members of their household—with the same two-dose treatment. Learn more prevention methods and how to prevent multiple infections and spread.
Diagnosis
If you or someone you know is showing signs of a pinworm infection, speak with your healthcare provider. There are three ways, with your help, your provider can diagnose pinworm infection:
Look for pinworms around the anus 2 – 3 hours after the who may be infected person goes to sleep.
Conduct a ""tape test"" to collect possible pinworm eggs around the anus.
Look at samples from under the fingernails of the person who may have pinworms.
Learn more about the specific steps to take on the Diagnosis page.
Treatment and recovery
There are medications, both over the counter and prescription, that can treat pinworm infection. If you or someone you care for are experiencing symptoms of pinworm infection, talk with your healthcare provider to be properly diagnosed.
Treat everyone in the same household and caregivers of the person diagnosed with pinworms at the same time. Treatment involves two doses of medication with the second dose given two weeks after the first dose. The medications kill worms but cannot kill eggs. The second dose is important to prevent infection by newly hatched adult worms that were not killed by the first treatment because they were still eggs.

APRIL 11, 2024
About Enterovirus D68
KEY POINTS
EV-D68 typically causes respiratory illness, which can be mild (like a common cold) or more serious.
Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 infection.
There are no vaccines to prevent EV-D68 infections.
What it is
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses. Non-polio enteroviruses, like EV-D68, are common, with most infections causing no symptoms or only mild symptoms.
You are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses during summer and fall, but infections can happen year-round.
Signs and symptoms
EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness or no symptoms at all.
Mild symptoms may include runny nose, sneezing, cough, body and muscle aches.
Serious symptoms may include wheezing and difficulty breathing.
Keep Reading:
Non-Polio Enteroviruses Symptoms and Complications
Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) symptoms
Call your doctor right away if:
You or your child develops any of these AFM symptoms, especially following a respiratory illness, or if you have difficulty breathing, or if symptoms worsen.
EV-D68 can also cause AFM, an uncommon but dangerous neurological condition that mostly affects children. AFM causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. Symptoms include:
Arm or leg weakness
Pain in the neck, back, arms, or legs
Difficulty swallowing or slurred speech
Difficulty moving the eyes or drooping eyelids
Facial droop or weakness
Keep Reading:
About AFM
Who is at risk
In general, infants, children, and teenagers are most likely to get infected with enteroviruses and become ill. This is because they do not yet have immunity (protection) from previous exposure to these viruses. CDC believes this is also true for EV-D68. Adults can get infected with enteroviruses, but they are more likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms.
Children with asthma
Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe symptoms from EV-D68 and other respiratory illnesses. Families should follow CDC guidance to maintain control of symptoms during enterovirus season. The season occurs each year in the United States during summer and fall.
Keep Reading:
Managing Asthma and EV-D68 Symptoms
How it spreads
Since EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, the virus can be found in an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as:
Saliva
Nasal mucus
Sputum (mucus-like secretions from the lungs)
EV-D68 likely spreads from person to person when an infected person:
Coughs
Sneezes
Touches a surface that is then touched by others
Prevention
There are no vaccines to prevent EV-D68 infections. You can take other actions to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by respiratory viruses, including EV-D68. CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance provides practical recommendations and information to help you lower your risk. To prevent severe illness from EV-D68, children and adults with asthma should also follow CDC's information on how to manage their asthma.
Testing and diagnosis
Most healthcare providers are not able to test for EV-D68. EV-D68 can only be diagnosed by doing specific lab tests on specimens from a person's nose and throat or blood.
Many hospitals and some doctors can test ill patients to see if they have enterovirus infection. However, most hospitals and doctors cannot do specific testing to determine the type of enterovirus, like EV-D68. CDC and some state health departments test for different enterovirus types by doing specialized tests including PCR or molecular sequencing.
Keep Reading:
Laboratory Testing for Non-Polio Enterovirus
Managing EV-D68 and asthma
CDC recommends the following:
Discuss and update your asthma action plan with your primary care provider.
Take your prescribed asthma medications, especially long-term control medications.
Be sure to keep your reliever medication with you.
Get a flu vaccine when available each year.
If you develop new or worsening symptoms, follow your asthma action plan.
If your symptoms do not go away, call your doctor right away.
If you support a child with asthma, be sure the caregiver and/or teacher is aware of the child's condition know how to help.
Keep Reading:
About Asthma
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific treatment or antiviral available for people with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Talk to a doctor about your symptoms and how to best control them. Some people with a dangerous respiratory illness may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy.

Environmental Health Practice
KEY POINTS
The environmental health workforce is critical to protecting public health and the environment.
These professionals help ensure healthy communities through the practice of environmental health.
Did you know?
About 1 in 4 environmental health professionals plans to retire within 5 years1, presenting recruitment and workforce development needs.
Describing the workforce helps us identify gaps in staffing and training and prepare to meet future challenges.
Why it matters
Building a stronger environmental health practice is important because
Environmental health professionals commonly work in multiple program areas, requiring unique technical and scientific expertise.
Environmental health professionals can leverage data to increase the impact of their services and inform best practices.
Environmental health efforts often go unnoticed until problems occur (for example, foodborne outbreaks, vector-borne diseases, contaminated water supplies, disasters).

About Environmental Health Services
KEY POINTS
Learn how environmental health (EH) programs deliver important services to protect their communities.
Typical services offered by these programs include inspecting restaurants, pools, and other facilities, investigating outbreaks, and assisting with emergency response.
These services aim to protect our health in the environments where we live, work, and play.
Environmental health programs work to keep communities safe
Did you take a shower, drink a glass of water, eat at a restaurant, or go for a swim today? We can engage in these everyday activities without worrying about getting sick because environmental health professionals work behind the scenes to keep them safe. For example, permitting and inspection programs help prevent outbreaks in restaurants, school cafeterias, swimming pools, and other facilities.
EH practitioners also investigate outbreaks to identify their environmental causes. They often perform critical functions during emergency responses. Examples include assessing shelters and food establishments, testing drinking water supplies, and controlling disease-carrying organisms (vectors).

Epidemiologic Studies of Emerging Environmental Hazards
AT A GLANCE
CDC conducts epidemiologic studies to better understand the relationship between human health and emerging environmental hazards. Areas of research include harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms (HABs) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
Background
Environmental epidemiologists at CDC develop innovative approaches to collect and analyze exposure and health data. The data helps them better understand the relationship between human health and emerging environmental exposures. Information gathered from their studies translates environmental public health science into actionable guidance, resources, and tools for environmental public health practitioners.
Key research areas include:
Harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms (HABs)
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
Additionally, emerging hazards identified through the surveillance of poison center data are prioritized for future research activities.
Examples of current research activities are listed below. For information on the results of past research activities, visit the environmental health studies publications webpage.
Harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms
Cyanotoxins in Air Study (CAST)
CDC is conducting a study in South Florida to assess the health effects of exposure to cyanotoxins in the air. CAST evaluates exposures to cyanotoxins among people who live or work near:
Lake Okeechobee
St. Lucie River
Caloosahatchee River
Cape Coral Canals
CDC is conducting this study to determine if breathing in cyanotoxins can make people sick or cause symptoms. Cyanotoxins are toxins (poisons) sometimes produced when small, plant-like organisms called cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) rapidly grow out of control or bloom.
Using electronic health records to assess exposures to cyanobacterial blooms
CDC is studying the relationship between symptoms identified through electronic health records and cyanobacterial blooms. This is being done in collaboration with:
Wisconsin Department of Health Services
Environmental Protection Agency
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
CDC is conducting research projects with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and other partners to study the health effects of PFAS.
Specifically, CDC is researching the associations between PFAS and:
Cardiovascular disease
Birth and mortality outcomes
Cancer
Technical assistance
Epidemiologists at CDC provide environmental epidemiology expertise to state, tribal, local, territorial, and international organizations to assist with designing and implementing epidemiologic studies. To request assistance, please contact ncehoutbreak@cdc.gov.

About Environmental Public Health Tracking
AT A GLANCE
The Environmental Public Health Tracking Program was established in 2002.
The Tracking Program brings together health and environmental data to drive actions to improve health.
Tracking uses a network of people and information systems to deliver a core set of data, information summaries, and tools.
Background
The Pew Environmental Health Commission issued a report in 2001 calling for establishment of an environmental public health tracking network. This network would monitor the level of burden from environmentally related disease.
Since 2002, the Environmental Public Health Tracking Program (Tracking Program) has provided accurate and timely standardized information.
The Tracking Program collects, integrates, analyzes, and disseminates non-infectious disease, environmental, and socio-economic data from various sources. These include a collective of national, state, and local partners. This data and information can be found on the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network).
CDC's Tracking Program empowers people to make information-driven decisions that affect their health. These include public health practitioners, healthcare providers, community members, policy makers, and others.
A first for environmental health
This program is the first national effort to provide the United States with standardized data from multiple information systems. It includes health, environmental, and hazard data. And it includes linkage of these data as part of regular surveillance activities.
Program priorities
Vision: Data-informed decisions to create healthy communities
Mission: To provide information from a nationwide network of integrated health and environmental data that drives actions to improve community health
View the Tracking Program's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan for more details about our priorities.
What's ahead
With 20 years of program successes, our understanding of the connections between public health and the environment is vastly improved. But there is more to do. Looking toward the future, we plan to continue and expand efforts to provide information that drives actions to improve health. We are striving to meet our vision for a world where data-informed decisions create healthy communities.
Funding recipients
CDC funds 33 recipients through a cooperative agreement. These recipients build, maintain, and implement local tracking programs and data networks; grow public health capacity and expertise in environmental health surveillance; and modernize data systems.

About Hygiene
KEY POINTS
Hygiene refers to behaviors that can improve cleanliness and lead to good health.
A few examples of hygiene can include how you care for your body, how you care for your baby, or how you care for your home environment to stay fresh and clean.
Many diseases and conditions can be prevented through proper hygiene practices, such as covering your coughs and sneezes, washing hands after handling animals, and showering before you swim.
Overview
Hygiene can refer to a number of different practices that can help to keep you and others healthy. There are many ways you can keep yourself and your environment clean to promote healthy living. A few important practices include personal hygiene, proper infant diapering and feeding, and everyday cleaning.
Personal hygiene refers to regularly washing parts of the body and hair with soap and water (including washing your hands and feet), grooming nails, facial cleanliness, covering coughs and sneezes, and menstrual hygiene. Personal hygiene practices can help you to feel fresh and healthy.
Infant feeding hygiene involves the careful cleaning, sanitizing, and storage of infant feeding items, such as baby bottles and breast pump parts to prevent germs from contaminating milk.
Safe and healthy diaper hygiene at home or childcare settings reduces the spread of germs and prevents babies and caregivers from getting sick.
Everyday cleaning in places you spend time, like your home, facilities, and early care and education settings, are effective ways to prevent the spread of disease and illness by removing germs from surfaces.

About the Epidemic Intelligence Service
KEY POINTS
The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) is CDC’s globally recognized applied epidemiology training program.
Established in 1951, EIS has trained over 4,000 disease detectives who have investigated and responded to a wide range of public health challenges and emergencies.
Overview
TEPHINET logo
EIS offers an unparalleled service and learning program. EIS officers are CDC's disease detectives who learn from and work alongside subject matter experts while providing service to domestic and international partners. EIS maintains its core focus on training disease detectives to practice consequential epidemiology, which is the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data for evidence-based public health action.
EIS was among the first programs to be accredited by the Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET
), the global network for field epidemiology training programs (FETPs), during their first accreditation cycle in 2016. During the 2023 reaccreditation cycle, EIS achieved reaccreditation at a new and higher level, earning distinction in all standards and merit in all thematic areas.
EIS will continue preparing generations of public health leaders for years to come. The EIS program plays a critical role in strengthening the public health workforce. We are focused on preparing a workforce that is ready to face existing and emerging public health threats. For both EIS officers and our staff, we are committed to attracting and recruiting highly trained and service-oriented applicants from a variety of disciplines, experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives.

Investigating and responding to public health threats since 1951
Preparedness
EIS has changed all elements of their program to be better prepared to respond and serve
The EIS program constantly evolves as the field of epidemiology, the science of learning and communication, and the needs of CDC and state and local health departments change over time. With most EIS officers remaining in public health positions after the fellowship, the EIS program is uniquely positioned to have an impact on public health.
We recognize this opportunity and accept the responsibility to recruit, select, and train EIS officers and program staff from a breadth of backgrounds who are well prepared to respond to existing and emerging public health threats. The following describes some examples of how we do this as a program:
Recruitment
Host a series of webinars that is available for all interested applicants about the EIS experience and the EIS application process
Host virtual participation opportunities for EIS conference attendees to learn about the program
Work with partners to increase awareness of the program.
Selection
Hold virtual interviews to reduce barriers for applicants to participate across geographic locations
Invite Selection Advisors (from outside of the EIS program) to review and participate in the fellowship selection process; this promotes transparency and ensures that the process is standardized and fair
Train staff involved as application reviewers and interviewers to ensure a standardized and fair process
Training
Facilitate trainings for EIS officers based on best practices for addressing all factors that influence health outcomes
Require programs that host EIS officers (or host sites) to describe how projects would consider all factors that influence health outcomes

The Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) Program
KEY POINTS
The Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) Program provides flexible funding to the nation's health departments to detect, prevent and respond to infectious disease outbreaks.
The ELC Program also administers the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases (ELC) Cooperative Agreement, a funding mechanism that awards critical support for infectious disease programs and projects.
Overview
Since 1995, ELC has played a vital role in building epidemiology, laboratory, and health information systems capacity for the nation's health departments while fostering cross-cutting solutions to address public health needs and supporting a response-ready workforce.
The ELC Program administers the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases (ELC) Cooperative Agreement, which provides financial support and technical assistance to state, local, and U.S. territory and affiliate health departments to detect, prevent, and respond to emerging infectious diseases.
Each year, ELC awards hundreds of millions of dollars to 65 recipients across the nation. These funded recipients serve as the foundation for our national public health infrastructure and are integral to the nation's ability to tackle infectious disease threats.
ELC accomplishes its mission through a unique structure of core public health programs; cross-cutting projects focusing on leadership, integration, flexibility, and sustainability; and a range of disease-specific projects. ELC also distributes supplemental funding on behalf of CDC for emergency response efforts, such as those for the influenza H1N1, Zika, and Ebola epidemics, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.

Epigenetics, Health, and Disease
KEY POINTS
Epigenetics refers to the way your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work.
Epigenetics turns genes ""on"" and ""off.""
Your epigenetics change as you age, both as part of normal development and aging and because of exposure to environmental factors that happen over the course of your life.
Epigenetic changes can affect your health in different ways.
What it is
Your genes play an important role in your health, but so do your behaviors and environment, such as what you eat and how physically active you are. Epigenetics refers to how your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work. Unlike genetic changes (mutations), epigenetic changes are reversible and do not change the sequence of DNA bases, but they can change how your body reads a DNA sequence.
Gene expression refers to the process of making proteins using the instructions from genes. A person's DNA includes many genes. Each gene includes instructions for making proteins. Additionally, there are other sections of DNA that are not part of any gene but are important for making sure the genes work properly. These DNA sections provide directions about where in the body the protein is made, when it is made, and how much is made.
While changes to the genes (mutations) can change the protein that is made, epigenetic changes affect gene expression to turn genes ""on"" and ""off."" This can mean that genes make proteins in cells and tissues where or when they normally would not, or that genes don't make proteins where and when they normally would. It can also mean that genes make more or less of a protein than they normally would.
There are several ways an environmental factor can cause an epigenetic change to occur. One of the most common ways is by causing changes to DNA methylation. DNA methylation works by adding a chemical (known as a methyl group) to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes off and demethylation turns genes on. Thus, environmental factors can impact the amount of protein a cell makes. Less protein might be made if an environmental factor causes an increase in DNA methylation, and more protein might be made if a factor causes an increase in demethylation.

Genetics Basics
Epigenetics and age
Your epigenetics change as you age as part of normal development.
Epigenetics and development
Epigenetic changes begin before you are born. All your cells have the same genes but look and act differently. As you grow and develop, epigenetics helps determine which function a cell will have—for example, whether it will become a heart cell, nerve cell, muscle cell, or skin cell.
EXAMPLE: Nerve cell and muscle cell. Your nerve cells and muscle cells have the same DNA, but they work differently. A nerve cell transports information to other cells in your body. A muscle cell has a structure that aids in your body's ability to move. Epigenetics allows the muscle cell to turn on genes to make proteins important for its job and turn off genes important for a nerve cell's job.
Epigenetics and age
Your epigenetics change throughout your life. Your epigenetics at birth are not the same as your epigenetics during childhood or adulthood.
EXAMPLE: A newborn, 26-year-old, and 103-year-old. Scientists measured DNA methylation at millions of sites in a newborn, 26-year-old, and 103-year-old. The level of DNA methylation decreased with age. The newborn had the highest level of DNA methylation, the 103-year-old had the lowest level of DNA methylation, and the 26-year-old had a DNA methylation level that was between that of the newborn and the 103-year-old.1
Epigenetics and exposures
Your epigenetics can change in response to your behaviors and environment.
Nutrition during pregnancy
A pregnant woman's environment and behavior during pregnancy, such as whether they eat healthy food, can change the baby's epigenetics. Some of these changes can remain for decades and might make the child more likely to get certain diseases.
EXAMPLE: Dutch Hunger Winter famine (1944–1945). People whose mothers were pregnant with them during the famine were more likely to develop certain diseases, such as heart disease, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes.2 Around 60 years after the famine, researchers looked at DNA methylation levels in people whose mothers were pregnant with them during the famine. These people had increased DNA methylation at some genes and decreased DNA methylation at other genes, compared with their siblings who were not exposed to famine before birth. 345These differences in DNA methylation could help explain why these people had an increased likelihood for certain diseases later in life.2567
Smoking
Exposures such as smoking can cause epigenetic changes. However, these epigenetic changes can be reversible in some cases.
EXAMPLE: Smokers, nonsmokers, and former smokers. Smoking can result in epigenetic changes. For example, at certain parts of the AHRR gene, smokers tend to have less DNA methylation than nonsmokers. The difference is greater for heavy smokers and long-term smokers. After quitting smoking, former smokers can begin to have increased DNA methylation at this gene. Eventually, they can reach levels similar to those of nonsmokers. In some cases, this can happen in less than a year, but the length of time depends on how long and how much someone smoked before quitting.8
Epigenetics and diseases
Certain diseases can change your epigenetics. In addition, some epigenetic changes can make you more likely to develop certain diseases, such as cancer.
Infections
Germs can change your epigenetics to weaken your immune system. This helps the germ survive.
EXAMPLE: Tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis. Infections with these germs can cause epigenetic changes in some of your immune cells that result in turning off the IL-12B gene. Turning off the IL-12B gene weakens your immune system and improves the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.9
Cancer
Certain mutations make you more likely to develop cancer. Likewise, some epigenetic changes increase your cancer risk. For example, having a mutation in the BRCA1 gene that prevents it from working properly makes you more likely to get breast and other cancers. Similarly, increased DNA methylation that results in decreased BRCA1 gene expression raises your risk for breast and other cancers.10 While cancer cells have increased DNA methylation at certain genes, overall DNA methylation levels are lower in cancer cells compared with normal cells.
Different types of cancer that seem similar can have different DNA methylation patterns. Epigenetics can be used to help determine which type of cancer a person has or can help to find hard-to-detect cancers earlier. Epigenetics alone cannot diagnose cancer. Cancers would need to be confirmed with further screening tests.
EXAMPLE: Colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancers have abnormal DNA methylation near certain genes, which affects expression of these genes. Some commercial colorectal cancer screening tests (for example, Cologuard®) use stool samples to look for this abnormal DNA methylation. It is important to know that if you have one of these tests and the result is positive or abnormal, you will need to have a colonoscopy, which is a procedure to check your colon for cancer.11

Epstein-Barr Virus and Infectious Mononucleosis
EXPLORE TOPICS

ESPAÑOL
About Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
KEY POINTS
EBV is one of the most common human viruses in the world and spreads through bodily fluids, primarily saliva.
EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses.
There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection.
What it is
Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, is one of the most common human viruses in the world. EBV is also known as human herpesvirus 4 and is a member of the herpes virus family.
Most people will get infected with EBV in their lifetime, especially in childhood, and will not have symptoms. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses.
About mononucleosis
EBV is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, also called ""mono."" This contagious disease is common among teens and adults.
Learn more
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of EBV infection can include:
Fatigue
Fever
Inflamed throat
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
Enlarged spleen
Swollen liver
Rash
People who get symptoms from EBV infection, usually teenagers or adults, get better in 2 to 4 weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several weeks or even months.
Who is at risk
After you get an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent (inactive) in your body. In some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates.
How it spreads
You can spread the virus for weeks!
When you first get EBV, you can spread it for weeks and even before you have symptoms. Once EBV is in your body, it stays inactive. If it reactivates, you can potentially infect others no matter how much time has passed since the first infection.
EBV is most commonly spread through saliva by:
Kissing
Sharing drinks and food
Sharing drinking cups, eating utensils, or toothbrushes
Having contact with toys that children have drooled on
The virus probably survives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist.
EBV can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations.
Prevention
There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. You can help protect yourself by reducing contact with people who have EBV infection.
Make sure you avoid:
Kissing
Sharing drinks and food
Using the same personal items that an infected person recently used
Testing and diagnosis
Diagnosing EBV infection can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to other illnesses. EBV infection can be confirmed with a blood test that detects antibodies. About 9 out of 10 adults have antibodies that show that they have a current or past EBV infection.

Laboratory Testing for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
Treatment and recovery
Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. There is no specific treatment for EBV. However, some things can be done to help relieve symptoms such as:
Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
Getting plenty of rest
Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
APRIL 11, 2024
About ESBL-producing Enterobacterales
KEY POINTS
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales are resistant to common antibiotics and may require complex treatments.
Infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales can occur both in and outside of healthcare settings.
Good hand hygiene and infection prevention practices can help reduce infection risk.
Overview
Enterobacterales are a group of bacteria that cause infections in healthcare settings and communities.
Some species are also a normal part of the human gut.
Some Enterobacterales produce enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs).
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) break down certain antibiotics, making some infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales difficult to treat.
Types
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales include germs like Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae).
In 2017, there were an estimated 197,400 cases of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales among hospitalized patients and 9,100 estimated deaths in the United States.
Signs and symptoms
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales can cause several different infections, including urinary tract and bloodstream infections. These bacteria can also live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, known as colonization.
Who is at risk
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections occur in healthcare settings like hospitals and nursing homes. These infections may also occur in healthy people.
After traveling abroad to places where these germs originate, people returning to the United States are at increased risk.
How it spreads
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales can spread from person to person through dirty hands and surfaces.
Outside the United States, they can spread through contaminated food or water. The role of food and water in the spread of these germs in the United States is not clear.
Reducing risk
Patients and caregivers should:
Wash their hands often with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Wash their hands after using the bathroom and before eating or preparing food.
Remind people (including healthcare staff) to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.
Follow recommended practices for food and water safety when traveling abroad.
Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Treatment and recovery
ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections are resistant to many prescribed antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. These infections might require hospitalization and intravenous (IV) antibiotics.
Carbapenems are often used to treat serious ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections, but resistance is on the rise for them, too. The more we rely on this important class of antibiotics, the greater the risk of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE).
What CDC is doing
Tracking ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales and slow the spread of resistant germs.

About Escherichia coli Infection
KEY POINTS
E. coli are bacteria found in many places like the intestines of people and animals.
Most kinds of E. coli are harmless, but some can make you sick.
This site focuses on the kinds of E. coli that cause diarrhea.
Overview
E. coli are germs called bacteria. They are found in many places, including in the environment, foods, water, and the intestines of people and animals.
Most E. coli are harmless and are part of a healthy intestinal tract. E. coli help us digest food, produce vitamins, and protect us from harmful germs.

But some E. coli can make people sick with diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, sepsis, and other illnesses. This website focuses on the kinds of E. coli that cause diarrhea.
People can get infected after swallowing E. coli.
This can happen through contaminated food or water or contact with animals, environments, or other people.
Some people are more likely to get infected.
Groups of people who are at increased risk for E. coli infection include:
Children younger than 5
Adults 65 and older
People with weakened immune systems
International travelers
E. coli infection can be serious.
Infection with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) can lead to a serious health condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems, and even death.
E. coli infection can be prevented.
The good news is that you can take steps to help keep yourself and your family safe.

Public Health Ethics
KEY POINTS
Public health ethics brings considerations, such as principles and values, to the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Public health ethics uses a systematic approach to clarify, prioritize, and justify possible courses of public health action.
Access training materials to learn more about public health ethics.
Background
As the nation's leading public health agency, CDC primarily takes a population-based approach to public health, targeting communities or populations in its activities. The public health problems that CDC addresses are often complex, involving multiple risk factors and multiple stakeholders. There are also many different perspectives on how to prevent or help health concerns and promote well-being.
CDC staff use a variety of scientific tools in their work. They use epidemiology, behavioral and social science, communication science, laboratory science, and many others. Another critical tool for public health decision making and action is public health ethics. Public health ethics brings considerations, such as principles and values, to the discussion. Public health ethics uses a systematic approach to clarify, prioritize, and justify possible courses of public health action. These actions are based on ethical principles, values and beliefs of stakeholders, and scientific and other information.
CDC and public health ethics
What public health ethics are
Public health ethics can be broken down into a field of study and a field of practice. As a field of study, public health ethics seeks to understand and clarify principles and values which guide public health actions. Principles and values provide a framework for decision making and a means of justifying decisions. Because public health actions are often undertaken by governments and are directed at the population level, the principles and values which guide public health can differ from those which guide actions in biology and clinical medicine (bioethics and medical ethics) which are more patient or individual-centered.
As a field of practice, public health ethics is the application of relevant principles and values to public health decision making. In applying an ethics framework, public health ethics inquiry carries out three core functions, namely:
Identifying and clarifying the ethical dilemma posed.
Analyzing it in terms of alternative courses of action and their consequences.
Resolving the dilemma by deciding which course of action best incorporates and balances the guiding principles and values.
Goals and structure for public health ethics at CDC
The CDC Office of Science supports CDC's public health ethics capacity to foster an environment and culture that:
Supports and develops ethical practices.
Raises staff awareness of public health ethics
Provides support for analyzing ethical issues.

Non-Polio Enterovirus
EXPLORE TOPICS
SEARCH
APRIL 11, 2024
About Enterovirus D68
KEY POINTS
EV-D68 typically causes respiratory illness, which can be mild (like a common cold) or more serious.
Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 infection.
There are no vaccines to prevent EV-D68 infections.
What it is
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses. Non-polio enteroviruses, like EV-D68, are common, with most infections causing no symptoms or only mild symptoms.
You are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses during summer and fall, but infections can happen year-round.
Signs and symptoms
EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness or no symptoms at all.
Mild symptoms may include runny nose, sneezing, cough, body and muscle aches.
Serious symptoms may include wheezing and difficulty breathing.
Keep Reading:
Non-Polio Enteroviruses Symptoms and Complications
Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) symptoms
Call your doctor right away if:
You or your child develops any of these AFM symptoms, especially following a respiratory illness, or if you have difficulty breathing, or if symptoms worsen.
EV-D68 can also cause AFM, an uncommon but dangerous neurological condition that mostly affects children. AFM causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. Symptoms include:
Arm or leg weakness
Pain in the neck, back, arms, or legs
Difficulty swallowing or slurred speech
Difficulty moving the eyes or drooping eyelids
Facial droop or weakness
Keep Reading:
About AFM
Who is at risk
In general, infants, children, and teenagers are most likely to get infected with enteroviruses and become ill. This is because they do not yet have immunity (protection) from previous exposure to these viruses. CDC believes this is also true for EV-D68. Adults can get infected with enteroviruses, but they are more likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms.
Children with asthma
Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe symptoms from EV-D68 and other respiratory illnesses. Families should follow CDC guidance to maintain control of symptoms during enterovirus season. The season occurs each year in the United States during summer and fall.
Keep Reading:
Managing Asthma and EV-D68 Symptoms
How it spreads
Since EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, the virus can be found in an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as:
Saliva
Nasal mucus
Sputum (mucus-like secretions from the lungs)
EV-D68 likely spreads from person to person when an infected person:
Coughs
Sneezes
Touches a surface that is then touched by others
Prevention
There are no vaccines to prevent EV-D68 infections. You can take other actions to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by respiratory viruses, including EV-D68. CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance provides practical recommendations and information to help you lower your risk. To prevent severe illness from EV-D68, children and adults with asthma should also follow CDC's information on how to manage their asthma.
Testing and diagnosis
Most healthcare providers are not able to test for EV-D68. EV-D68 can only be diagnosed by doing specific lab tests on specimens from a person's nose and throat or blood.
Many hospitals and some doctors can test ill patients to see if they have enterovirus infection. However, most hospitals and doctors cannot do specific testing to determine the type of enterovirus, like EV-D68. CDC and some state health departments test for different enterovirus types by doing specialized tests including PCR or molecular sequencing.
Keep Reading:
Laboratory Testing for Non-Polio Enterovirus
Managing EV-D68 and asthma
CDC recommends the following:
Discuss and update your asthma action plan with your primary care provider.
Take your prescribed asthma medications, especially long-term control medications.
Be sure to keep your reliever medication with you.
Get a flu vaccine when available each year.
If you develop new or worsening symptoms, follow your asthma action plan.
If your symptoms do not go away, call your doctor right away.
If you support a child with asthma, be sure the caregiver and/or teacher is aware of the child's condition know how to help.
Keep Reading:
About Asthma
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific treatment or antiviral available for people with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Talk to a doctor about your symptoms and how to best control them. Some people with a dangerous respiratory illness may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy.

About Heat and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Protect yourself and others when it's hot outside by staying cool, staying hydrated, and knowing the symptoms.
Hot days can affect anyone. If you are pregnant, are a child or teen with asthma, or have a heart condition or other chronic health conditions, heat can make your health worse.
Work with your doctor to create a Heat Action Plan
Stay Cool
If you are outside, especially for a long time, and the HeatRisk is red or above, you can:
Stay in the shade as much as possible
Take breaks when you can
Do outdoor activities during the coolest parts of the day or evening, if possible.
When you are indoors, you can:
Use fans, but only if indoor temperatures are less than 90°F. In temperatures above 90°F, a fan can increase body temperature.
Use air conditioning or find a location that has one by dialing 2-1-1, visiting the National Center for Healthy Housing's Cooling Centers by State
page, or by contacting your local health department or emergency management agency.
Check on your family, friends, and neighbors, especially if they have chronic medical problems or live alone. Check on pets.
Stay Hydrated
Drink plenty of fluids
Carry a water bottle. Drink and refill it throughout the day.
Consider limiting beverages high in sugars and sodium, caffeine, and alcohol, if possible.
Check your urine color. When it's light yellow or clear, it usually means you are drinking enough water.
Drinking water on hot days can help keep you hydrated, regardless of how active you are.
Know the Symptoms
If your body gets too hot, you can get sick. Know the symptoms of your body overheating and know when to seek medical care.
Symptoms can include:

FUNGAL DISEASES
APRIL 24, 2024
Fungal Eye Infections Basics
KEY POINTS
Fungal eye infections are extremely rare but can be very serious.
Most fungal eye infections occur from eye injuries.
Eye surgeries and bloodstream infections can also cause fungal eye infections.
Fungal eye infections are treated with prescription antifungal medications.
Overview
Medical illustration of Fusarium, a fungus that causes eye infections.
Eye infections can be caused by many different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, amoeba, and fungi. Eye infections caused by fungi are extremely rare but can be very serious.
Types
There are two main types of fungal eye infections, depending on the part of the eye that is infected. Many types of fungi can cause eye infections.
Types of infections
The two types of fungal eye infections are keratitis and endophthalmitis. Keratitis is an infection of the clear, front layer of the eye (the cornea). Endophthalmitis is an infection of the inside of the eye (the vitreous and/or aqueous humor).
Endophthalmitis can occur two different ways. Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs after fungal spores enter the eye from an external source. Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs when a bloodstream infection (for example, candidemia) spreads to one or both eyes.
Many types of fungi can cause infections.
Fusarium –lives in the environment, especially in soil and on plants.
Aspergillus – common mold foundi n indoor and outdoor environments.
Candida – a type of yeast that normally lives in and on the body.
Symptoms
The symptoms of a fungal eye infection can show up anytime from several days to several weeks after an exposure. Fungal eye infection symptoms are similar to those of other types of eye infections, like those caused by bacteria.
Symptoms can include:
Eye pain
Eye redness
Blurred vision
Sensitivity to light
Excessive tearing
Eye discharge
Causes
A fungal eye infection can be caused by:
Eye injury, especially with plant material (i.e., thorns or sticks).
Eye surgery or invasive eye procedures.
Contaminated medical products are a potential risk factor.
Chronic eye disease involving the surface of the eye.
Wearing contact lenses.
Fungal bloodstream infection (like candidemia).
Risk factors:
People who have diabetes, a weakened immune system, or use corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory steroids) have a higher risk of fungal eye infections. Fungal keratitis may be more common among people living in rural areas.
Eye infections can occur after eye surgery.
Prevention
Wearing eye protection when outside can help prevent fungal eye infections caused by eye injuries that involve plant material. For many activities, wearing sunglasses can offer some protection. Outdoor workers and farmworkers should wear appropriate protective eyewear.
People who wear contact lenses should care for their lenses properly. Learn more about how to protect your eyes while wearing contacts.
If you think you have an eye infection it is important to see a healthcare provider or eye doctor right away.
Diagnosis
An eye doctor can examine your eye and test for infection.
The most common way to diagnose a fungal eye infection is done by a doctor collecting a sample of tissue or fluid from the eye. The sample is sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope or cultured.
Polymerase chain reaction and confocal microscopy, a type of optical imaging, are also being used as newer, faster forms of diagnosis.
Treatment and recovery
The treatment for a fungal eye infection depends on the type of fungus, the severity of the infection, and the parts of the eye that are affected. Possible forms of treatment for fungal eye infections include:
Antifungal eye drops.
Antifungal medication given as a pill.
Antifungal medication injected.
Eye surgery may be needed if infections do not get better after using antifungal medications.
