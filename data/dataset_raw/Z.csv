Zoonotic Hookworm

About Zoonotic Hookworm
KEY POINTS
Zoonotic hookworm is a parasite common in cats and dogs.
It lives in soil contaminated with animal feces (poop).
It burrows into people's skin, leaving red, itchy tracks.
Most people who are infected recover without treatment.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Zoonotic hookworms are parasites that normally live in animals like dogs or cats. However, they can spread to humans through the skin. When they infect people, the hookworms can cause a disease called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM).
People become infected when young hookworms, known as larvae, burrow into unprotected skin. This can happen when people are walking barefoot or sitting (with exposed skin) on soil or sand contaminated by animal feces.
Signs and symptoms
Zoonotic hookworm larva cause CLM by burrowing into the skin of a person's foot or body. This burrowing can cause:
Severe itching
Raised red lines on skin, also called tracks
These symptoms will go away after several weeks as the parasite dies.
In rare cases, some types of hookworm may infect deeper tissue in the intestine, lungs, or possibly the eye.
Risk factors
Cases of CLM often occur in people who have traveled to tropical regions where dog and cat hookworm larvae can survive in the soil.
If you walk barefoot in soil or sand in these regions, you can get zoonotic hookworm. However, you can find zoonotic hookworms anywhere in the world. In the United States, they're more common on the East Coast than the West Coast.
How it spreads
Animals infected with hookworm pass the parasites' eggs out of their body in their feces.
The eggs mature and hatch, releasing young hookworms, or larvae, into the soil or sand.
When you step on or sit in that soil with your bare skin, hookworm larvae can latch onto you and begin to burrow into your skin.
Prevention
Dispose of animal waste quickly to keep eggs from getting into soil and hatching.
Make sure dogs and cats get regular veterinary care, including deworming if needed.
Wear shoes and avoid skin contact with contaminated sand or soil.
If you travel to tropical or subtropical climates, especially where there are beaches, wear shoes and use protective mats or other coverings to keep your skin from touching sand or soil directly.
Diagnosis
If you have symptoms of CLM, speak with your healthcare provider. Your provider will examine your skin for itchy, red tracks made by hookworms, usually on the legs or feet.
There is no blood test for zoonotic hookworm infection. But your provider may ask you about recent travel and can help provide an accurate diagnosis.
Treatment
Most people with a zoonotic hookworm infection recover without medical treatment in 5 – 6 weeks, as the parasites that cause CLM die.
But in some cases, a healthcare provider might prescribe
Antiparasitic drugs to help kill hookworms
Antibiotics to help treat any bacterial infections in the damaged skin

About Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
KEY POINTS
About 1 in every 3 people in the United States will have shingles (or herpes zoster) in their lifetime.
Shingles can sometimes lead to serious complications like long-term nerve pain and vision loss.
The best way to protect yourself from shingles is vaccination.

What it is
Shingles is a painful rash illness. People get shingles when the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox, reactivates in their bodies after they have already had chickenpox.
An estimated 1 million people get shingles each year in this country. Most people who develop shingles only have it one time during their life. However, you can have shingles more than once.
Signs and symptoms
People with shingles most commonly have a rash around the left or right side of the body. The rash is usually painful, itchy, or tingly.
Shingles can lead to serious complications. The most common shingles complication is long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN.

Shingles Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
You are at risk for shingles if:
You have had chickenpox.
More than 99% of Americans born before 1980 had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it. Children can have shingles, but it is not common.
Your risk of shingles and serious complications increases:
As you get older.
If you have medical conditions that keep your immune systems from working properly such as certain cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, and HIV infection.
If you take drugs that keep your immune system from working properly, like steroids and drugs given after an organ transplant.
Causes and spread
If you are near someone with shingles:
You cannot get shingles from someone who has shingles.
You can get chickenpox from someone who has shingles if you never had chickenpox or never got chickenpox vaccine. You could then develop shingles later in life.
Shingles is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus stays in their body. The virus can reactivate later in life and cause shingles.
People who never had chickenpox or didn't get chickenpox vaccine can get infected with VZV from someone who has shingles. These people can get the virus through:
Direct contact with the fluid from shingles rash blisters.
Breathing in virus particles that come from the blisters.
People with chickenpox are more likely to spread VZV than people with shingles.

About Chickenpox
Prevention
Protect yourself with the vaccine. CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy.

Shingles Vaccine Recommendations
The best way to prevent shingles is by getting 2 doses of the vaccine.
If you have shingles, protect others
Covering the shingles rash can lower the risk of spreading the shingles virus to others. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before the blisters appear or after the rash scabs over.
To prevent spreading the virus to others:
Cover the rash
Avoid touching or scratching the rash
Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds
Avoid contact with the following people until your rash scabs over
Pregnant women who never had chickenpox or chickenpox vaccine
Premature or low birth weight infants
People with weakened immune systems
Treatment and recovery
Several antiviral medicines are available to treat shingles:
Acyclovir (ay-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Valacyclovir (va-luh-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
Famciclovir (fam-sah-EE-kluh-veer)
These medicines shorten the length and severity of the illness. They work best when you take them as soon as the rash appears. If you think you have shingles, contact your doctor as soon as possible to talk about treatment.
Pain relief medicine may help with the pain caused by shingles. This can be over the counter or a prescription from your doctor. Wet compresses, calamine lotion, and warm oatmeal baths may help relieve itching.
