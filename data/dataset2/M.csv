Machine Safety in the Workplace
KEY POINTS
When considering safety with any machine, know what makes the machine stop and go.
Machines can cause serious workplace injuries.
Safeguards are essential to protect workers from injury.
Overview
All industries use machines and need to be aware of machine safety.
Machine related injuries and fatalities are a major concern across industries. Machines are essential to many work tasks. They have built-in capabilities like motion, force, high temperature, and other energy sources, which contribute to its potential for causing harm.
Machine safety begins with understanding the nature of the machine's operation. Some machines are designed to execute unchanging tasks, while others might operate continuously until completion. Additionally, certain machines function automatically, while others perform various functions on command. Understanding the specific characteristics and modes of operation of each machine is fundamental to machine safety.
Terms to know
Contact injury
The occupational safety and health industry define injury types by how they happen. A contact injury is an injury caused by contact with another device, machine or surface. Most machine injuries are contact injuries. A machine may cause a contact injury if it is on or off.
There are different kinds of contact injuries, including:
Caught-in (caught-in or caught-between a moving part)
Avulsions (removal of skin)
Amputations (loss of an appendage, even a fingertip)
Burns
Crushes
Falls
Hits to the machine or other devices or surfaces
Safeguards
Safeguards are protections or actions taken to guard, protect, prevent, or lessen the severity of an injury. Not all safeguards offer complete protection by themselves. How a safeguard interacts with the worker and process as a whole determines an effective safeguard.
Controlling exposures to hazards in the workplace is vital to protecting workers. The hierarchy of controls is a way of determining which actions will best control exposures. For more information, see: Hierarchy of Controls | NIOSH | CDC
Robots
Robots are machines or automated technologies that can perform a series of actions.
Machines and robots
Robots are capable of a wide range of tasks, from navigating unmanned vehicles to conducting surgical procedures. To learn more about NIOSH robotics research, visit:

Facts
2018-2022: 3,677 workers were killed by contact with objects and equipment.
In 2022
There were 5,846 fatalities, and 2,066 were transportation related.
Fatalities that were likely machinery related (contact with objects and equipment) accounted for 738 out of 5,846 total (12.6%).
For more information about machine related fatalities: Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Summary 2022
Did you know?
The NIOSH Work-RISQS Number query returned 106,000 nonfatal illnesses and injuries associated with contact with objects. This was 4.6% of all injuries and illnesses in the database across all industries for the year 2022. Data is based on occupation emergency department visits.
Safety risks
Whether it is through cutting, pressing, moving, or exerting force, machines have risks that include sharp edges, heat, power, chemicals, and other hazards. These features can be essential for machines to complete tasks. These hazards are built-in, so it is important to use safeguards to mitigate the risk of injury. For example:
A forklift needs to move and lift
A hydraulic press used in manufacturing is designed to apply significant force to shape or mold materials
Some industries at risk are more obvious like manufacturing, construction, machine shops with metalworking equipment, or woodshops with woodworking equipment. However, convenience, gas, food stores, department stores warehouses and others have ice machines, bagel slicers, meat slicers, washing machines, and many others that change our daily home and work lives.
Best practices
Employers should:
Safeguard any machine part, function, or process that might cause injury when possible.
Follow government regulations, specific state industry standards, and insurance requirements.
Educate employees on machine safety for the machines they use.
Workers should:
Follow machine safety guidelines for the machines they use.
Stay up to date on safety training.
Pay attention to the task when operating any machinery.

Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)

Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)
Also called Mad Cow Disease
WHAT TO KNOW
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal brain disease in cows that is caused by a prion. BSE caused a major outbreak in the 1980-90s, with cases reported in at least 24 countries. Most cases occurred in the United Kingdom, but many other countries also reported cases. Changes to feed policies have made BSE extremely rare now. However, animal health officials continue to monitor suspicious deaths in cows to watch for a potential BSE recurrence.
Causes and risk
BSE is caused by a prion, an infectious protein. Prions are misfolded forms of proteins normally found in the bodies of animals and people.
It typically takes years for symptoms to begin after an animal is infected with a prion.
Scientists believe BSE may have been caused by feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that contained prion-infected products from cows or sheep.
There is strong evidence the BSE outbreak grew and spread throughout the U.K. when such infected feed was given to young calves.
Outbreaks
The United Kingdom
The first two cases of BSE were identified in cows in 1986 in the United Kingdom. The cows were likely infected in the 1970s.
The U.K. quickly became the epicenter of the outbreak. Overall, more than 184,000 cows in the U.K. died from BSE between 1986 and 2015. The outbreak was widespread, with more than 35,000 U.K. herds affected.
Cases peaked in 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Cases deceased drastically after control measures were implemented. BSE cases are still reported occasionally but are very rare.
Other Countries
Outside the U.K., BSE was first reported in Ireland in 1989 and Portugal and Switzerland in 1990.
By 2005, the number of countries reporting BSE among native cattle increased to 24, with the majority in Europe.
North America
The first North American BSE case was reported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the UK. Rendered cohorts of this cow may have been responsible for 19 additional Canadian BSE cases beginning in 2003.
In addition, animal health officials have identified 6 BSE cases in cows in the United States. One was imported from Canada and is believed to have been infected there. The others were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed.
Control Measures
Animal health officials eventually determined BSE-infected cows had eaten feed made from other cows that died from prion disease. This led to feed bans in multiple countries, which drastically reduced the number of BSE cases reported.
Early efforts to control the BSE outbreak focused on culling (killing) sick animals to prevent them from entering the food chain.
The UK implemented the most stringent control measure - excluding animals >30 months old from the human and animal food supplies. It also included a ban on using meat from around the animals' spinal columns since prions affect the nervous system. The programs - along with bans in other countries - have prevented additional BSE outbreaks.
Occasional cases still occur, but they are very rare.
Risk to People
Strong evidence exists that consuming meat from BSE-infected cows causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people.
vCJD cases began in the U.K. about 10 years after BSE-contaminated beef likely made its way for an extended period into food produced for people. This is consistent with the time between when someone is exposed to a prion disease and when they develop one themselves.
As BSE has been largely eradicated, it is not thought to pose much risk to people currently.

About The Model Aquatic Health Code
KEY POINTS
CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is guidance to prevent injury and illness at aquatic venues open to the public.
This guidance brings together the latest science and best practices to help jurisdictions save time and resources when they develop and update pool codes, addressing topics like building aquatic facilities and lifeguard training.
Overview
CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is guidance to prevent injury and illness linked to aquatic venues — such as pools, hot tubs, and splash pads — open to the public. This guidance brings together the latest science and best practices to help jurisdictions save time and resources when they develop and update pool codes. Pool codes regulate how aquatic venues that are open to the public are designed, constructed, operated, and managed. These codes address topics such as how aquatic facilities are built, how lifeguards are trained and certified, and how chlorine levels in the water are tested.
The MAHC applies to aquatic venues open to the public. These venues can be operated by:
Hotels and motels
Apartment complexes
Homeowners' associations
Membership clubs (for example, gyms)
Schools
Waterparks
CDC works with the Council for the Model Aquatic Health Code (CMAHC)
to ensure the Model Aquatic Health Code stays current. The CMAHC regularly collects, assesses, and relays national input on needed MAHC revisions.
The 2023 MAHC provides guidance for public aquatic venues to help prevent injury and illness.
Why it's important
The primary objective of the MAHC is to prevent injuries and illnesses at pools, hot tubs, and splash pads open to the public, including:
Drowning
More children ages 1–4 die from drowning than any other cause of death. For children ages 5–14, drowning is the second leading cause of death from unintentional injury after motor vehicle crashes.
Pool chemical injuries
Pool chemical injuries account for about 4,500 emergency department visits each year. At least one third of the patients are under 18 years old.
Disease outbreaks linked to swimming
Over 200 disease outbreaks linked to pools, hot tubs, and splash pads occurred during 2015–2019. The leading cause of these outbreaks was Cryptosporidium. This parasite is very chlorine tolerant and can cause outbreaks that can sicken hundreds or even thousands of people.
Public pool and hot tub/spa closings because of public health hazards
One out of eight routine public pool inspections and one out of seven routine public hot tub or spa inspections result in immediate closure because of at least one violation representing a serious threat to public health.
Background
Most health departments and related agencies have programs to help ensure swimmers and aquatics staff stay safe and healthy. Previously, each individual agency had to do its own research to develop or update pool codes because no single science-based reference existed at the national level. This means pool codes can greatly vary across the United States.
CDC created the MAHC at the request of health departments and the aquatics sector to provide scientifically based guidance at the national level. The first edition of the MAHC was released in 2014 and it has been updated every few years since then. The MAHC helps jurisdictions save the time and resources previously used to develop and update their codes themselves.
Policy
The MAHC is not a federal law. The MAHC is a CDC guidance document and only becomes law if voluntarily adopted by a local, state, territorial, or tribal jurisdiction. This means jurisdictions can:
Choose to adopt all of it or parts of it
Modify part or all of it to fit their needs
Use it as a reference
Aquatics sector leaders can also work with health departments to use the MAHC to make swimming and other water activities safer and healthier, even if the jurisdiction has not yet adopted the MAHC.

About Mammograms
KEY POINTS
A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast.
Doctors use a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer.
Regular mammograms can find breast cancer early, sometimes up to 3 years before it can be felt.
How a mammogram is done
You will stand in front of a special x-ray machine. A technologist will place your breast on a plastic plate. Another plate will firmly press your breast from above. The plates will flatten the breast, holding it still while the x-ray is being taken. You will feel some pressure. The steps are repeated to make a side view of the breast. The other breast will be x-rayed in the same way.
You will then wait while the technologist checks the x-rays to make sure the pictures do not need to be redone. Keep in mind that the technologist cannot tell you the results of your mammogram. Each woman's mammogram may look a little different because all breasts are a little different. A doctor with special training, called a radiologist, will look at the x-ray for early signs of breast cancer or other problems.
What a mammogram feels like
Having a mammogram is uncomfortable for most women. Some women find it painful. A mammogram takes only a few moments, though, and the discomfort is over soon. What you feel depends on the skill of the technologist, the size of your breasts, and how much they need to be pressed. Your breasts may be more sensitive if you are about to get or have your period.
Tips for getting a mammogram
Try not to have your mammogram the week before you get your period or during your period. Your breasts may be tender or swollen then.
On the day of your mammogram, don't wear deodorant, perfume, or powder. These products can show up as white spots on the X-ray.
Some women prefer to wear a top with a skirt or pants, instead of a dress. You will need to undress from your waist up for the mammogram.
Are you worried about the cost?
CDC offers free or low-cost mammograms through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.
Find out if you qualify.
About the results
When will I get the results of my mammogram?
You will usually get the results within a few weeks, although it depends on the facility. A radiologist reads your mammogram and then reports the results to you and your doctor. If there is a concern, you will hear from the mammography facility earlier. Contact your health care provider or the mammography facility if you do not receive a report of your results within 30 days.
What happens if my mammogram is normal?
Continue to get mammograms according to recommended time intervals. Mammograms work best when they can be compared with previous ones. This allows the radiologist to compare them to look for changes in your breasts.
What happens if my mammogram is abnormal?
An abnormal mammogram does not always mean that there is cancer. But you may need to have additional mammograms, tests, or exams before the doctor can tell for sure. You may also be referred to a breast specialist or a surgeon. It does not necessarily mean you have cancer or need surgery. These doctors are experts in diagnosing breast problems. Doctors will do follow-up tests to diagnose breast cancer or to find that there is no cancer.

About Filarial Worms
KEY POINTS
Filarial worms are a type of microscopic parasitic worm.
They mainly spread through insect bites.
Symptoms from filarial worm infections can be minor (e.g., itching or swelling) but may be severe (e.g., blindness).
There are antiparasitic drugs that can treat filarial worm infections.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Filarial worms are a family of parasites that are found in tropical regions. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Once they infect a person, they can cause diseases that attack different parts of the body.
Symptoms
Symptoms of filarial worm infections range from itching and swelling to disfigurement and blindness. However, many people infected with filarial worms will have no symptoms.
Diseases and common symptoms caused by filarial worms include
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, can cause itchy skin and skin changes and damage the eyes and may lead to blindness.
Lymphatic filariasis, sometimes called elephantiasis, can cause severe swelling of body parts, particularly legs, arms, genital area, and other parts of the body.
Loiasis, also known as Loa loa or African eye worm, can cause itchy, non-painful swellings on limbs or worms that move across the eye.
Mansonellosis, which can cause fever, fatigue, and joint and abdominal (belly) pain.
Causes and spread
Filarial worm diseases affect millions of people a year in Africa, South America, the Pacific islands, and Asia. They spread mostly through the bites of insects like blackflies, mosquitoes, or midges.
Tiny immature worms, known as larvae, will enter a human body when the insect bites into the skin. Once inside a person, they spread throughout the body, grow, and reproduce. When an insect bites an infected person, the insect can ingest the new larvae and eventually infect another person.
Prevention
In most cases, the best way to prevent most filarial worm infections is to avoid insect bites. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using insect repellent on exposed skin, and sleeping under mosquito nets will help prevent insects from biting you.
Treatment
Medications known as antiparasitic drugs can treat new filarial worm infections. In people with advanced disease-causing chronic swelling, surgery or lymphedema care may be needed.
Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are currently the target of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. These campaigns deliver safe and inexpensive drugs aimed at reducing or eliminating transmission of these infections. For some, filaria MDA will reduce symptoms as well. For others, other treatments are needed for symptoms.

About Marburg
KEY POINTS
Marburg virus disease (Marburg) is a rare but severe hemorrhagic fever that can cause serious illness and death.
Symptoms can be similar to other tropical diseases, making diagnosis challenging.
There is no treatment or vaccine for Marburg.
The disease spreads through contact with infected animals or people.
MORE INFORMATION

Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Marburg is a rare, severe viral hemorrhagic fever which affects both people and other primates, like apes and monkeys. Caused by infection with orthomarburgviruses, Marburg virus or Ravn virus, the disease can lead to serious illness or death. Symptoms can appear suddenly and may include fever, rash, and severe bleeding.
Orthomarburgviruses are naturally found in the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and can spread from bats to people. Marburg virus is most commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa.
Marburg virus disease is named for the German city where scientists became ill with the disease's first known cases in 1967, while handling monkeys imported from Africa.
Healthcare providers:
Review clinical screening and diagnosis guidance for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like Marburg.
Clinical Screening and Diagnosis for VHFs
View LargerDownload
Most Marburg outbreaks have occurred in central Africa
Symptoms
Initial Marburg symptoms include:
Fever
Chills
Headache
Muscle aches
Rash with both flat and raised bumps, often on the torso
Chest pain
Sore throat
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
As the disease advances, symptoms can become more severe, including liver failure, delirium, shock, bleeding (hemorrhaging), and multi-organ dysfunction.
How long it takes for signs to show
People with Marburg usually start getting sick 2-21 days after they were infected with the virus.
Risk factors
Those most at risk for Marburg include:
People in contact with Egyptian rousette bats or their excretions
People caring for individuals sick with the disease without proper protective equipment
People in contact with infected non-human primates
How it spreads
The Marburg virus is spread from infected Egyptian rousette bats to people. The virus is found in the saliva, urine, and feces of infected bats. Once the disease has ""spilled over"" from wildlife to people, those who are sick can spread the disease to other people.
Someone can become infected with the Marburg virus if they have contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with:
Body fluids of a person who is sick with or died from Marburg
Objects contaminated with their fluids like clothes, bedding, needles and equipment
Semen from a man who has recovered from infection with Marburg
Prevention
To prevent Marburg
Avoid contact with blood and body fluids of people who are sick.
Avoid contact with semen from a person who recovered from Marburg until testing shows that the virus is gone from their semen.
Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected person's body fluids.
Avoid contact with Egyptian rousette bats and non-human primates if in areas where Marburg is found.
Diagnosis
The following tests can be used for patients who had a possible exposure to an orthomarburgvirus and begin to show signs and symptoms of Marburg :
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
IgM-capture ELISA
Antigen-capture ELISA testing
Virus isolation in high-containment laboratories
Treatment and recovery
Currently, there are no licensed treatments for Marburg. Treatment is limited to supportive care. This includes rest, hydration, managing oxygen status and blood pressure, and treatment of secondary infections.
Expected outcomes
Marburg virus causes a serious, deadly disease. Between 20-90 percent of people with the disease will die.
What CDC is doing
To combat Marburg, CDC:
Responds to Marburg outbreaks around the globe.
Provides infection prevention and control guidance.
Offers confirmatory diagnostic testing.
Conducts ongoing research to better understand the disease.

Harmful Algal Blooms and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Harmful algal blooms are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria in water that can harm people, animals, or the environment.
Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick.
Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad.
Overview
Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or ""bloom."" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick.
What they look like
Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see.
A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red.

How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom
When they're harmful
Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they:
Make toxins
Become too dense
Use up oxygen in the water
Release harmful gases
Types
Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick.
Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers.
Dinoflagellates or diatoms are the most common causes of harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays.
Keep Reading:
Types of Harmful Algal Blooms
Where they're found
Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or brackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for recreation and for drinking.
Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United States, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
What causes them
Algae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a harmful algal bloom when water is:
Warm
Slow-moving
Full of nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorous
Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or runoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans. This can happen during rainstorms, for example.
Environmental changes, such as warmer water, might be making harmful algal blooms worse.
Learn more about factors that help harmful algal blooms grow.
Health impacts
Harmful algal blooms cause a variety of mild to serious illnesses. Symptoms depend on the type of harmful algal bloom you come in contact with and how you are exposed.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
Harmful agal blooms can be deadly for animals
Contact a veterinarian immediately if your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water. Animals can get very sick or even die within hours of coming into contact with harmful algae or cyanobacteria. Learn more about protecting pets and livestock.
Risk of exposure
People and animals can get sick from having contact with water or food that contains certain types of algae, cyanobacteria, or their toxins.
You or your animals can get sick if you:
Go in or near water contaminated by a harmful algal bloom
Swallow contaminated water
Eat contaminated shellfish or fish
Use contaminated blue-green algae dietary supplements
Keep Reading:
How People and Animals Get Sick From Harmful Algal Blooms
Preventing exposure
You can take steps to avoid getting sick from harmful algal blooms. For example:
Stay out of discolored, scummy, or smelly water and keep pets away.
Check for and follow swimming, fishing, and shellfish advisories.
Follow guidance from local officials if there is a harmful algal bloom in your drinking water supply.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
After exposure
If you or your animal go in water with an algal bloom, rinse off with tap water right after.
If you think you have symptoms caused by a harmful algal bloom, contact a healthcare provider or the Poison Control hotline
at 1-800-222-1222.
If your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water, contact a veterinarian right away. You can also call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center
at 1-888-426-4435 or the Pet Poison Helpline
at 1-855-764-7661. Note that there is a fee for these calls.
What CDC is doing
CDC works with federal, state, local, and territorial partners to reduce the health impact of harmful algal blooms. This includes:
Public health research
Tracking harmful algal blooms and illnesses
Developing methods to detect toxins
Outreach and education
Providing health departments with financial and technical support
Find data

About Maritime Safety and Health
KEY POINTS
Maritime industries have a higher fatality rate and risk of injury and illness than the national average for all workplaces.
Maritime workers face some hazards that are unique to a specific maritime industry.
Overview
Aerial view of loading a cargo ship in Seattle.
There are approximately 400,000 workers employed in U.S. maritime industries. These workers face a higher risk of fatality, injury, and illness than other American workers. In fact, commercial fishing is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. Likewise, the water transportation industry has a fatality rate 4.7 times higher than the rate for all U.S. workers.
Hazards presented by the maritime environment can be encountered both on the water and at waterfront facilities, such as shipyards and marine terminals. There are some hazards that are unique to a specific maritime industry.
What's being done
The NIOSH Center for Maritime Safety and Health Studies addresses the unique occupational safety and health hazards within the maritime industries. It currently prioritizes seven maritime industries/occupations:
shipyards
marine terminals and port operations
marine transportation
seafood processing
commercial fishing
aquaculture
commercial diving
These industries and occupations have injury, illness and fatality rates higher than others in the U.S. They also pose unique challenges for occupational safety and health outreach, as many are made up of small businesses with few or seasonal employees or are in remote locations. In some settings, maritime employees live and work aboard vessels.

Aquaculture 1125 6,627 18.9 5,237.4
Commercial Diving SOC 49-9092 3,509 158.9 1,867.4
Fatal and nonfatal injury and illness rates may be inflated due to undercounting of total workers in some industries/occupations. Traditionally, maritime workers have been undercounted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics due to the remoteness of job location, part-time or temporary nature of the work, overlap with other industries/occupations, and other factors.
NAICS is the North American Industry Classification System and SOC is the Standard Occupational Classification.
Worker counts are based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics six-year average of workers, 2011–2017. Commercial fishing counts are from the Current Population Survey, commercial diving counts are from Occupational Employment and Wages tables, and all others are from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.
Fatality rates are based on six-year averages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 2011–2017.
Nonfatal injury and illness rates are based on six-year averages of Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, 2011–2017.

Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine Safety
SAFETY INFORMATION BY VACCINE |
PAGE 9 OF 18 | ALL PAGES
KEY POINTS
You can protect against measles, mumps, and rubella with vaccination.
Overview
Measles causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Complications can include ear infection, diarrhea, pneumonia, brain damage, and death.
Mumps causes fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen salivary glands. Complications can include swelling of the testicles or ovaries, deafness, inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis) and, rarely, death.
Rubella, causes fever, sore throat, rash, headache, and red, itchy eyes. If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage, or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.
Due to high vaccination rates, outbreaks of measles, mumps, and rubella in the U.S. are not as common as they were before the vaccine began being used. However, these diseases still appear in the U.S. and people who decide not to vaccinate their children because of religious or personal beliefs put their children and others at risk for getting these diseases.
Available vaccines & manufacturer package inserts
The FDA approved M-M-R II
in 1971 for use in people 12 months of age and older.
The FDA approved PRIORIX
in 2022 for use in people 12 months of age and older.
The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine also protects against these diseases.
Keep Reading:
Vaccine Information Statement
Common side effects
Sore arm from the shot.
Fever.
Mild rash.
Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women who did not already have immunity to the rubella component of the vaccine.
Some people may experience swelling in the cheeks or neck. MMR vaccine rarely causes a temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder that usually goes away without treatment and is not life threatening.
Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella.
When to call 911
Severe allergic reactions following vaccination are rare, but can be life threatening. If someone experiences symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, which can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness.
MMR vaccine has been linked with a very small risk of febrile seizures. Febrile seizures following MMR vaccination are rare and are not associated with any long-term effects. Because the risk of febrile seizures increases as infants get older, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as soon as recommended.
Extremely rarely, a person may have a serious allergic reaction to MMR vaccine. Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine.
Report possible adverse events to VAERS
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is an early warning system, co-managed by CDC and FDA, that monitors for potential vaccine safety problems. Healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers are required by law to report certain adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event) following vaccination to VAERS; patients and caregivers can also submit reports.
Submitting a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Report and Using VAERS Data
A closer look at the safety data
Two studies indicate that for every 10,000 children who get their first MMR and varicella vaccines as separate shots when they are ages 12-23 months, about four will have a febrile seizure during the 7-10 days following vaccination. Children of the same age who get the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine as their first vaccine against these diseases are twice as likely to have a febrile seizure during the same time period.12
Studies have shown that for children younger than 7 years old, there is a very small increased risk of febrile seizures approximately 6 to 14 days after MMR vaccination; this happens in about 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 children.
Joint pain is associated with the rubella portion of MMR vaccine among people who do not have immunity to rubella. Joint pain and temporary arthritis happen more often after MMR vaccination in adults than in children. Women also experience this reaction more often than men. Joint pain or stiffness occurs in up to 1 in 4 of females past puberty who were not previously immune to rubella; their symptoms generally begin 1 to 3 weeks after vaccination, are usually mild and last about 2 days. These symptoms rarely come back.
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder that decreases the body's ability to stop bleeding. It can happen after both natural measles infection as well as after getting the MMR vaccine. However, it is usually not life threating. Treatment may include blood transfusion and medications. The risk of ITP has been shown to be increased in the six weeks following an MMR vaccination, with one study estimating 1 case per 40,000 vaccinated children.
Measles inclusion body encephalitis, or severe brain swelling caused by the measles virus, is a complication of getting infected with the wild-type measles virus. While rare, this disorder almost always happens in patients with weakened immune systems. The illness usually develops within 1 year after initial measles infection and has a high death rate. There have been three published reports of this complication happening to people who are vaccinated. In these cases, encephalitis developed between 4 and 9 months after MMR vaccination. In one case, the measles vaccine strain was identified as the cause.
Safety studies
Adverse events
The most common adverse events following the MMR vaccine are pain where the vaccine is given, fever, a mild rash, and swollen glands in the cheeks or neck.
Studies have shown a small increased risk of febrile seizures occurs among children who are younger than 7 years old approximately 8-14 days after vaccination at a rate of one for every 3,000-4,000 children vaccinated with MMR vaccine. This is compared to children not vaccinated during the preceding 30 days.
Separating MMR vaccine shots
No published scientific evidence shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots.
Outbreaks
Measles outbreaks can occur in communities with a high number of unvaccinated people. Maintaining high overall MMR vaccination rates is needed to continue to limit the spread of measles.
Autism
Because signs of autism may appear around the same time children receive the MMR vaccine, some parents may worry that the vaccine causes autism. Vaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for recent increases in the number of children with autism. In 2004, a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that there is no link between autism and MMR vaccine, and that there is no link between autism and vaccines that contain thimerosal as a preservative.
Fact
Many carefully performed scientific studies have found no link between MMR vaccine and autism.3456

Vaccines and Autism
How CDC monitors vaccine safety
CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are committed to ensuring that vaccines provided to the public are safe and effective. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized for emergency use in the United States, CDC and FDA continuously monitor them through several safety systems.

AT A GLANCE
The Epidemiology Elective Program (EEP) is an elective rotation for medical and veterinary students. Most students earn academic course credit.
EEP offers 6- and 8-week rotations. Students learn applied epidemiology through training, project assignments, and mentorship from public health experts.
Project assignments are with CDC, other federal agencies, and state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments.
Background
The Epidemiology Elective Program (EEP) is a short-term, service-learning rotation in applied epidemiology. Medical and veterinary students learn through training, project assignments, and mentorship from public health experts.
Students can participate in a 6- or 8-week rotation. Projects assignments are with CDC, other federal agencies, and state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments. Every effort is made to place students with a host site that provides experience in leadership and project in a topic area of the student's interest.
Project assignments involve helping public health experts investigate public health problems such as infectious disease outbreaks, natural disasters, chronic diseases, and poor access to healthcare.
Most schools award academic course credit for participation in EEP.
View Larger
Check out and share the EEP flyer.
Impact
More than 2,100 medical and veterinary students have completed EEP since its inception in 1975. Many students go on to participate in CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program and become public health leaders.
Meet Amy Xie, MD, a 2020 EEP student who joined EIS in 2023
Dr. Xie had this to say about her EEP rotation: ""Working alongside a CDC medical officer and EIS officer during a coronavirus field investigation enabled me to learn about public health response through first-hand experience. I got to see how decisions are made and how an incident command team is structured. I had the chance to contribute to field investigation information that was published in two Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports. I see great value in being a physician with epidemiology training!""

Medicine and Pregnancy: An Overview
KEY POINTS
Medicine use in pregnancy is common.
If you're pregnant or thinking of getting pregnant, talk to your healthcare providers before starting or stopping any medicines.
Background
Almost all pregnant women face decisions about taking medicines during pregnancy. Many need to take medicines during pregnancy to treat health conditions. In some cases, avoiding or stopping a medicine during pregnancy may be more harmful than taking it.
And yet, certain medicines during pregnancy can increase the risk for health problems, such as some birth defects, prematurity, or pregnancy loss.
What the data shows
Medicine use during pregnancy is common. About 9 in 10 women report taking some type of medicine during pregnancy. About 7 in 10 report taking at least one prescription medicine. From 1997–2018, use of at least one prescription medication in the first trimester increased 35%.12
Safety information is lacking. Fewer than 10% of medicines approved since 1980 have enough information to determine their safety during pregnancy. This is because pregnant women are often not included in studies that determine the safety of new medicines.3
As a result, women and healthcare professionals have limited information to make informed treatment decisions during pregnancy.
Common questions
Is it safe for me to take medicines before I get pregnant?
Many women need to take medicine to stay healthy before and during pregnancy. If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss your current medicines with your healthcare provider. Creating a treatment plan for your health condition before pregnancy can help keep you and your baby healthy.
I took a medicine before I knew I was pregnant. What do I do?
If you're concerned about medicines you took before you knew you were pregnant, talk with your healthcare provider about your concerns. Some medicines can be harmful when taken during pregnancy, but others are unlikely to cause harm. If you're concerned and cannot reach your doctor, contact an expert for free at MotherToBaby
.
Should I trust online information about medicine safety in pregnancy?
Use caution when consulting online sources about medicine safety in pregnancy. Instead, use the information you find to start a conversation with a healthcare professional. Many websites post lists of medicines that are ""safe"" to take during pregnancy. However, for many medicines listed, there is not enough scientific evidence of their safety during pregnancy.
Can I take medicine once I'm no longer pregnant? Can I take medicines if I'm breastfeeding?
Although many medications do pass into breast milk, most have little or no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. For more detailed information, LactRx
is an online database that provides information about managing your health conditions while breastfeeding.
What's being done
CDC and partners study medicine use in pregnancy to understand how specific medicines might affect pregnancy. Results of these studies provide better information on the safety and risks of using specific medicines before, during, and after pregnancy.
This information can help you weigh the risks and benefits of medicines. It can also help you and your healthcare provider make decisions about treatment options.

Research on Medicines and Pregnancy
What you can do
Talk to your healthcare providers before starting or stopping any medicines. Be sure to discuss the following with your healthcare providers:

Medication Safety and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement.
An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat.
ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.
Why it's important
The number of ADEs can increase due to:
Development and use of new medicines.
Discovery of new uses for older medicines.
The aging American population.
Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.
Learning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.
More than 1.5 million emergency visits
Each year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.
Tips
Practice medication safety at home
Adults
Keep a list
Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements.
Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.
Follow label directions
Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.
Take medicine on time
Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime).
Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.
Turn a light on
Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake.
If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.
Ask questions
If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.
Get the tests you need
Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.
Children
Know the dose.
Always:
Read the label.
Follow directions.
Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.
Check the label
Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines.
Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient.
If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Use the right tool
If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one.
Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.
Get questions answered
If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.
Teach children
Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.
Lock the safety cap
Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.
Put medicines away
After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location.
Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.
What CDC is doing
Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies.
Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups.

About Melioidosis
KEY POINTS
Melioidosis is a bacterial infection in people and animals.
Melioidosis is spread through contact with contaminated soil, air, or water.
Cases may increase after hurricanes, heavy rain, and other severe weather events.
The disease is often confused for other conditions, making diagnosis difficult.
Melioidosis is treated with antibiotics.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Melioidosis is caused by bacteria called Burkholderia pseudomallei, or B. pseudomallei. It's spread to people and animals through direct contact with soil, air, or water contaminated by the bacteria. Cases may increase after hurricanes, heavy rain, and other severe weather events because the bacteria rise to the surface of the soil.
People can get melioidosis by:
Breathing in contaminated dust or water droplets
Having contact with contaminated soil or water, especially through skin breaks (cuts, scrapes, etc.)
It's very rare for people to get the disease from another person.
Many kinds of animals can get melioidosis, including:
Sheep
Goats
Pigs, hogs, boar
Horses
Cats
Dogs
Cows
B. pseudomallei is mostly found in tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where it causes widespread melioidosis. In the United States, B. pseudomallei occurs in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Gulf Coast area of the state of Mississippi. Most melioidosis illnesses in the United States occur in people who have traveled to areas where the disease is more common. Some cases have also occurred in people who have had contact with contaminated products made overseas.
Signs and symptoms
Melioidosis has a wide range of signs and symptoms. You usually develop symptoms of melioidosis within 1 to 4 weeks after you've been exposed to it. Some cases have developed symptoms months or years after exposure. The disease can affect one body system or affect the entire body. Because of these factors, melioidosis is hard to diagnose and may be mistaken for other diseases.
Sometimes the illness is just in one area (localized), and it may look like an ulcer or skin sore. You might have a fever, swelling, and muscle aches.
Most often, melioidosis shows up as a lung infection. You might have a cough, chest pain, high fever, headache, and you might not feel like eating.
Whether you've just come down with melioidosis or you've had it for a long time, it can affect different organ systems throughout the body (disseminated infection). It can cause problems with the liver, spleen, prostate, joints, bones, lymph nodes, skin, or brain. Melioidosis can lead to a dangerous bloodstream infection (sepsis).
Symptoms of disseminated infection include:
Fever
Headache
Trouble breathing
Stomach or chest pain
Muscle pain
Confusion
Seizure
Risk factors
Although healthy people may get melioidosis, having the following medical conditions may increase your risk:
Diabetes
Heavy alcohol use
Liver disease
Kidney disease
Thalassemia (a blood disorder)
Cancer, or another condition that weakens the immune system
Chronic lung disease, like cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or bronchiectasis
Certain activities also may increase your risk of being exposed to the bacteria that causes melioidosis, including:
Travel to areas where the disease is common.
Breathing in contaminated water droplets or soil dust that get into the air after severe weather like hurricanes or heavy rainfall.
Hobbies or jobs that could put you in contact with contaminated soil or water.
Drinking unchlorinated or untreated drinking water.
Reducing risk
In areas where the disease is widespread, contact with contaminated soil or water can put people at risk for melioidosis. To help lower the risk of exposure:
If you have open skin wounds, or if you have chronic conditions like diabetes or kidney disease, avoid contact with soil and standing water.
If you perform agricultural work or have hobbies or jobs that raise your risk of exposure, wear boots, which can prevent infection through your feet and lower legs.
Healthcare workers can use standard precautions when treating patients with melioidosis to help prevent infection. They should also label samples appropriately if they suspect melioidosis to protect lab personnel.
Laboratory personnel should follow good laboratory practices, including using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protection.
Treatment and recovery
If you are diagnosed with melioidosis, doctors will decide how long you'll need treatment based on how bad the infection is. Treatment generally includes:
Intravenous (in the vein) antibiotics from 2 to 8 weeks, followed by
Oral (pills by mouth) antibiotics for 3 to 6 months
It's important to complete your treatment so that the infection goes away completely.
What CDC is doing
One reason public health authorities study the disease is because the bacteria that cause melioidosis might be used as a weapon in a biological attack. A biological attack is the intentional release of pathogens (germs) that can sicken or kill people, livestock, or crops.
We don't know if this kind of attack will ever happen. CDC and other federal agencies prepare for many of biological attacks to protect as many people as possible.
Keep Reading:
Melioidosis and Bioterrorism
CDC works with state, tribal, local, and territorial agencies to investigate potential cases of melioidosis. Among other cases, in 2021, CDC linked four cases of melioidosis in patients from Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas. A public health investigation eventually linked all cases to a commercially imported product from a melioidosis-endemic country that each of the patients used in their homes.
B. pseudomallei was recently found to occur naturally in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. CDC is working with health departments to learn more about how widespread the bacteria is and what impact it's having on health.

Thimerosal and Vaccines
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS |
PAGE 9 OF 9 | ALL PAGES
KEY POINTS
Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that has been used for decades in the United States in multi-dose vials (vials containing more than one dose) of medicines and vaccines.
There is no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines, except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site.
In July 1999, the Public Health Service agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines as a precautionary measure.
Overview
About thimerosal
Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust, air, soil, and water. Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed — methylmercury and ethylmercury — are very different.
Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic to people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible out of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some methylmercury.
Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body more quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm.
Purpose of thimerosal
Thimerosal is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose (multi-dose vials) to prevent growth of germs, like bacteria and fungi.
Introduction of bacteria and fungi has the potential to occur when a syringe needle enters a vial as a vaccine is being prepared for administration. Contamination by germs in a vaccine could cause severe local reactions, serious illness or death. In some vaccines, preservatives, including thimerosal, are added during the manufacturing process to prevent germ growth.
Removal of thimerosal
Fact
Thimerosal was taken out of childhood vaccines in the United States in 2001.
Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines do not and never did contain thimerosal.
Varicella (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal.
Influenza (flu) vaccines are currently available in both thimerosal-containing (for multi-dose vaccine vials) and thimerosal-free versions.
For a complete list of vaccines and their thimerosal content level, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Thimerosal in Vaccines
page.
What the research shows
Fact
Thimerosal use in medical products has a record of being very safe. Data from many studies show no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines.123456
The most common side-effects of thimerosal in vaccines are minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site. Although rare, some people may be allergic to thimerosal.
No connection with autism
Research does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Many well conducted studies have concluded that thimerosal in vaccines does not contribute to the development of autism.135 Even after thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to increase, which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism.
Fact
A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal does not increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1
No association with neuropsychological delays
Studies have assessed the possible association between ethyl mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing vaccines and neuropsychological functioning including an objective measurement of neuropsychological functioning.
Fact
Research shows no association between thimerosal exposure and neuropsychological delays.24
Timeline: Thimerosal in Vaccines
2010
September 13. Results of a CDC study do not support an association between prenatal and infant exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal and an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
2009
February 1. Results of an Italian study
 were reassuring that immunization in infancy with thimerosal-containing vaccines does not decrease neuropsychological performance later in childhood.
2007
September 27. Results of a CDC study
 do not support an association between early exposure to thimerosal in vaccines and neuropsychological problems in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years.
July 7. CDC issues a statement on autism and thimerosal that states in part: “Some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal (from the addition of important vaccines recommended for children) explains the higher prevalence [of autism] in recent years. However, evidence from several studies examining trends in vaccine use and changes in autism frequency does not support such an association.”
2006
September 26. In a statement prepared for the Coalition for Mercury-free Drugs, the FDA concludes that the evidence reviewed by the IOM in 2004 does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.
2004
May 28. ACIP recommends that children between the ages of 6 and 23 months routinely receive an inactivated influenza (flu) vaccine. ACIP does not recommend using the thimerosal-free flu vaccine over the thimerosal-containing flu vaccine, and states that the benefits of flu vaccination outweigh any risk from thimerosal exposure.
May 17. After reviewing over 200 scientific studies that examined thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, IOM concludes in a report
 that the studies “consistently provided evidence of no association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.”
2003
November. A study
 finds no consistent significant associations between exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines and a variety of kidney, nervous system, and developmental problems.
August. Another study
 looks for a link between autism incidence and the use of thimerosal-containing vaccines. The study does not find a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism in Denmark and Sweden, where autism rates continued to increase although thimerosal was removed from vaccines in 1992.
January. The last children’s vaccines that use thimerosal as a preservative expire 
.
2001
Except for influenza (flu), thimerosal is removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and under manufactured for the U.S. market.
October 1. IOM’s Immunization Safety Review Committee issues a report
 concluding there is not enough evidence to disprove claims that thimerosal in childhood vaccines causes autism, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, or speech or language delay.
May 5. A risk assessment
 of thimerosal use in childhood vaccines finds no evidence of harm from the use of thimerosal as a preservative, other than redness and swelling at the injection site.
2000
June 7 and 8. Fifty-one vaccine and vaccine safety researchers and experts meet in Atlanta, GA to review data regarding thimerosal in vaccines and nervous system disorders. A report summarizing the meeting was presented to ACIP.
1999
The FDA reviews
 the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines and finds no evidence of harm, but as a precautionary measure, recommends removing thimerosal from vaccines routinely given to infants.
November 5. CDC states that vaccine manufacturers, FDA, and other agencies are working together to reduce the amount of thimerosal in vaccines, or to replace them with thimerosal-free vaccines, as soon as possible.
October 20. ACIP reviews information about thimerosal in vaccines provided by CDC’s National Immunization Program and several vaccine manufacturers regarding the availability of vaccines that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative.
July 7. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service issue a joint statement that says “There is no data or evidence of any harm caused by the level of exposure that some children may have encountered in following the existing immunization schedule.” The American Academy of Family Physicians issues a comparable statement soon after.
Frequently asked questions
What is thimerosal?
Thimerosal is a vaccine additive, added to some vaccines to prevent germs (like bacteria and fungi) from growing in them. If germs grow in vaccines, they can cause illness—or even death.
Why do some people worry about thimerosal in vaccines?
You may have heard that thimerosal has mercury in it. Not all types of mercury are the same. Some types of mercury, like mercury in some kinds of fish, stay in the human body and can make people sick. Thimerosal is a different kind of mercury. It doesn’t stay in the body, and is unlikely to make us sick.
Is thimerosal safe?
Yes. Thimerosal has been used safely in vaccines for a long time (since the 1930s).
Scientists have been studying the use of thimerosal in vaccines for many years. They haven’t found any evidence that thimerosal causes harm.
Is thimerosal still used in vaccines for children?
No. Thimerosal hasn't been used in vaccines for children since 2001.
However, thimerosal is still used in some flu vaccines. Yearly flu vaccines are recommended for all children. If you are worried about thimerosal, you can ask for a flu vaccine without it.
Does thimerosal cause autism?
No. Research does not show any link between thimerosal and autism.
Keep Reading:
Vaccines and Autism
Are there side effects from thimerosal in vaccines?
Most people don't have any side effects from thimerosal, but some people will have mild side effects like redness and swelling at the place where the shot was given, which will only last 1 to 2 days. It's very unlikely you will have an allergic reaction to thimerosal.
How can I find out if thimerosal is in a vaccine?
Ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Ask to see the vaccine's list of ingredients. All vaccine packages come with information (called an insert) that lists the ingredients.

Thimerosal and Vaccines
What CDC is doing
Fact
CDC and FDA closely monitor the safety of all vaccines.
CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are committed to ensuring that vaccines provided to the public are safe and effective. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized for emergency use in the United States, CDC and FDA continuously monitor them through several safety systems.

Mesothelioma Basics
KEY POINTS
Mesothelioma is a cancer that forms in the thin tissue that lines many of your internal organs.
Exposure to asbestos causes most cases of mesothelioma.
Overview
Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Mesothelioma is a cancer that forms in the thin tissue that lines many of your internal organs. This thin tissue is called the mesothelium.
The most common kind of mesothelioma forms in the tissue around the lungs, called the pleura. This is called pleural mesothelioma. But mesothelioma may also form in:
The tissue in the abdomen, called the peritoneum.
The tissue around the heart, called the pericardium.
The tissue around the testicles, called the tunica vaginalis.
View Larger
Malignant mesothelioma forms in the tissue that lines the chest or abdomen or the tissue that surrounds the heart or the testicles.

for licensing.
Symptoms
Pleural mesothelioma can cause:
Pain in your chest, under your rib cage.
Coughing.
Shortness of breath.
Lumps under the skin on your chest.
Tiredness.
Weight loss you can't explain.
Peritoneal mesothelioma can cause:
A swollen abdomen.
Pain in your abdomen.
Nausea.
Tiredness.
Weight loss you can't explain.
If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. They may be caused by something other than cancer. The only way to know what is causing them is to see your doctor.
Risk factors
Risk factors for mesothelioma include:
Being exposed to asbestos at work.
Living with someone who works with asbestos.
Living or working in a building where materials that contain asbestos have been disturbed.
Living in an area with natural asbestos deposits or asbestos mines or factories.
Causes
Photo of an asbestos mineral called asbestiform riebeckite ore or crocidolite.
Exposure to asbestos causes most cases of mesothelioma. Asbestos is a group of minerals naturally found in rocks and soil that form long, thin, very strong fibers. Asbestos fibers do not evaporate or dissolve in water. They resist heat and fire and cannot be broken down easily by chemicals or bacteria.
Asbestos was used in many consumer products, automobile parts, and building materials in the 20th century, before scientists learned about its dangers to health. Asbestos is no longer mined in the United States, but it is imported from other countries to make some products. It is still present in some older homes and buildings.
Working with materials that contain asbestos can release tiny asbestos fibers, too small to see, into the air. Some workers and others who breathed in or swallowed asbestos fibers over many years have developed mesothelioma and other diseases. Not everyone who is exposed to asbestos will get mesothelioma or other cancers. If you are concerned, ask your doctor if you should get regular checkups or tests for asbestos-related diseases.
Diagnosis
It can be hard to tell the difference between mesothelioma and other cancers. You may need to have a physical exam and other tests, such as imaging tests (a chest x-ray or CT scan) or a biopsy (removing a small piece of tissue to look at under a microscope).
Treatment and recovery
Treatment depends on where the mesothelioma is located and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy.
Surgery: An operation in which doctors cut out the cancer.
Chemotherapy: Use of special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer. The drugs can be pills you take or medicines given in your veins, or sometimes both.
Radiation therapy: Use of high-energy rays (similar to x-rays) to kill the cancer.
Immunotherapy: Special medicines that doctors use to help your body's immune system fight the cancer.
Targeted therapy: Use of drugs to block the growth and spread of cancer cells. The drugs can be pills you take or medicines given in your veins. You will get tests to see if targeted therapy is right for your cancer type before this treatment is used.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials use new treatment options to see if they are safe and effective. If you have cancer, you may want to take part. Visit the sites listed below for more information.

Overview
Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is a very common germ. About one out of every three people have the germ on their skin or in their nose. This germ does not cause problems for most people.
MRSA is a type of staph that can be resistant to several antibiotics. Anyone can get a MRSA infection or carry MRSA. The risk increases for people with hospitalizations or nursing home stays, skin-to-skin contact with others (such as in contact sports), and exposure to crowded and unhygienic places.

Clinical Overview of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Healthcare Settings
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of an S. aureus infection, including MRSA, depend on the part of the body that is infected. Broken skin, such as scrapes or cuts, is often the site of a MRSA infection. Most S. aureus skin infections, including MRSA, appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that might be:
Red.
Swollen.
Painful.
Warm to the touch.
Full of pus or other drainage.
Accompanied by a fever.
You cannot tell by looking at the skin if it's a MRSA infection. People sometimes confuse some MRSA skin infections with a spider bite. However, unless you actually see the spider, the irritation is likely not a spider bite.
If you or someone in your family experiences the signs and symptoms of MRSA infection:
Contact your healthcare provider, especially if the symptoms include a fever or do not improve within 48 hours.

Do not pick at or pop the bump or sore.

Cover the area with clean, dry bandages until you can see a healthcare provider.

Clean your hands often.
Complications
MRSA infections can cause serious problems in and outside of healthcare settings, including:
Pneumonia (lung infections).
Bloodstream infections.
Surgical site infections.
Sepsis, the body's extreme response to an infection (if left untreated).
Death (if left untreated).
Who is at risk
Although anyone can get MRSA, some groups have a higher risk:
Athletes.
Daycare and school students.
Military personnel in barracks.
People who receive inpatient medical care.
People who have surgery or medical devices inserted in their body.
People who inject drugs.
How it spreads
MRSA spreads in the community through contact with infected people, wounds, or things that have touched infected skin and are carrying the bacteria.
Some people who carry MRSA can go on to get a MRSA infection.
Prevention
You can reduce your risk of MRSA infections and help prevent their spread.

Preventing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
Diagnosis
A healthcare provider must send a clinical specimen to a laboratory to determine if MRSA is the cause of an infection.
Treatment and recovery
Healthcare providers often prescribe antibiotics to treat MRSA infections. Some types of S. aureus infections need surgery to drain infected areas. Your healthcare provider will determine which treatments are best for you. While MRSA can be resistant to several antibiotics, meaning these drugs cannot cure the infections, there are antibiotics available to treat MRSA infections.
What CDC is doing
Tracking MRSA infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by MRSA and slow the spread of resistant germs.

Harmful Algal Blooms and Your Health
KEY POINTS
Harmful algal blooms are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria in water that can harm people, animals, or the environment.
Going in or near water with a harmful algal bloom can make you and your animals sick.
Stay out if water looks discolored, has scum, or smells bad.
Overview
Algae and cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) are plant-like organisms that live in water. They can quickly grow out of control, or ""bloom."" Some of these blooms produce toxins (poisons) that make people and animals sick.
What they look like
Harmful algal blooms can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water. They can also grow underneath the water, making some harmful algal blooms hard to see.
A bloom can change the color of the water—for example to green, blue, brown, or red.
Keep Reading:
How to Recognize a Harmful Algal Bloom
When they're harmful
Not all blooms are harmful. Blooms of algae or cyanobacteria can harm people, animals, or the environment if they:
Make toxins
Become too dense
Use up oxygen in the water
Release harmful gases
Types
Many different types of algae can cause harmful algal blooms. However, three types —cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and diatoms—cause most blooms that make people and animals sick.
Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most common cause of harmful algal blooms in fresh water, such as lakes or rivers.
Dinoflagellates or diatoms are the most common causes of harmful algal blooms in salt water, such as oceans or bays.
Keep Reading:
Types of Harmful Algal Blooms
Where they're found
Harmful algal blooms can grow in fresh water, salt water, or brackish water (a mixture of fresh and salt water). This includes water people use for recreation and for drinking.
Harmful algal blooms occur across the world. In the United States, they have been reported in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
What causes them
Algae and cyanobacteria occur naturally in water. They are more likely to grow into a harmful algal bloom when water is:
Warm
Slow-moving
Full of nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorous
Nutrients get into water when fertilizer, sewage, or runoff from cities and industrial buildings washes into lakes, rivers, or oceans. This can happen during rainstorms, for example.
Environmental changes, such as warmer water, might be making harmful algal blooms worse.
Learn more about factors that help harmful algal blooms grow.
Health impacts
Harmful algal blooms cause a variety of mild to serious illnesses. Symptoms depend on the type of harmful algal bloom you come in contact with and how you are exposed.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
Harmful agal blooms can be deadly for animals
Contact a veterinarian immediately if your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water. Animals can get very sick or even die within hours of coming into contact with harmful algae or cyanobacteria. Learn more about protecting pets and livestock.
Risk of exposure
People and animals can get sick from having contact with water or food that contains certain types of algae, cyanobacteria, or their toxins.
You or your animals can get sick if you:
Go in or near water contaminated by a harmful algal bloom
Swallow contaminated water
Eat contaminated shellfish or fish
Use contaminated blue-green algae dietary supplements
Keep Reading:
How People and Animals Get Sick From Harmful Algal Blooms
Preventing exposure
You can take steps to avoid getting sick from harmful algal blooms. For example:
Stay out of discolored, scummy, or smelly water and keep pets away.
Check for and follow swimming, fishing, and shellfish advisories.
Follow guidance from local officials if there is a harmful algal bloom in your drinking water supply.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Illnesses Caused by Harmful Algal Blooms
After exposure
If you or your animal go in water with an algal bloom, rinse off with tap water right after.
If you think you have symptoms caused by a harmful algal bloom, contact a healthcare provider or the Poison Control hotline
at 1-800-222-1222.
If your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or near water, contact a veterinarian right away. You can also call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center
at 1-888-426-4435 or the Pet Poison Helpline
at 1-855-764-7661. Note that there is a fee for these calls.
What CDC is doing
CDC works with federal, state, local, and territorial partners to reduce the health impact of harmful algal blooms. This includes:
Public health research
Tracking harmful algal blooms and illnesses
Developing methods to detect toxins
Outreach and education
Providing health departments with financial and technical support
Find data
The One Health Harmful Algal Bloom System (OHHABS) collects information to help CDC and partners better understand and prevent illnesses caused by harmful algal blooms.

Microcephaly
KEY POINTS
Microcephaly (my-crow-sef-ah-lee) is a birth defect where a baby’s head is smaller than expected.
Babies with microcephaly often have smaller brains that might that did not develop properly.
Researchers estimate that about 1 in every 1,150 babies has microcephaly in the United States
What it is
Microcephaly is a condition where a baby’s head is much smaller than expected.
During pregnancy, a baby’s head grows because the baby’s brain grows. Microcephaly can occur because a baby’s brain has not developed properly during pregnancy or stopped growing after birth. Microcephaly can occur alone or in combination with other major birth defects.
View LargerDownload
The severity of microcephaly can range from mild to severe.
Severe microcephaly
Severe microcephaly is a serious, extreme form of this condition. It can be life-threatening.
Other problems
Babies with microcephaly can have multiple health problems, depending on the severity of the child's microcephaly. Common problems include:
Seizures1
Developmental delay, such as problems with speech and walking2
Intellectual disability1
Problems with movement and balance2
Feeding problems, such as difficulty swallowing
Hearing loss
Vision problems1
Causes
The causes of microcephaly in most babies are unknown.1 Some known causes of microcephaly are:
Infections during pregnancy, such as Zika, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus
Malnutrition during pregnancy
Malnutrition in the baby after birth
Exposure to harmful substances, such as alcohol or certain drugs
Problems with blood supply to the baby's brain during development
Diagnosis
Microcephaly can be diagnosed during pregnancy through ultrasound, or after the baby is born.
During pregnancy
Prenatal diagnosis of microcephaly can be done late in the second or early in the third trimester.
After the baby is born
To diagnose microcephaly after birth, a healthcare provider will measure the head circumference of the baby. This is a measure of the distance around the baby's head. The provider then compares this measurement to population standards using CDC charts (based on age and sex) or INTERGROWTH 21st
(based on age, sex, and pregnancy duration). Microcephaly is a head circumference that is significantly smaller than the average for babies of the same age and sex.
Commonly used birth head circumference reference charts are based on measurements taken before 24 hours of age. So, it is common to measure a baby's head circumference in the first 24 hours.
Head circumference measurements may be influenced by factors related to delivery that might alter the shape of the baby's head. If the baby's head was affected by the delivery, a provider might wait longer than 24 hours. Widely accepted head circumference charts are the WHO charts
for 0-2 years.
If the healthcare provider suspects microcephaly, he or she can request tests to help confirm the diagnosis and look for other problems. For example, magnetic resonance imaging can provide information on the structure of the baby's brain.
Treatment
Microcephaly is a lifelong condition. There is no known cure or standard treatment for microcephaly. Microcephaly can range from mild to severe, and treatment options can range as well. Babies with mild microcephaly often do not experience any additional problems. These babies will need regular check-ups to monitor their growth and development.
For more severe cases, babies will need ongoing care and treatment focused on managing their health problems (mentioned above). Developmental services early in life often help babies with microcephaly to improve and maximize their physical and intellectual abilities. These services, known as early intervention, can include speech, occupational, and physical therapies. Sometimes medications also are needed to treat seizures or other symptoms.

About Micronutrients
KEY POINTS
Vitamins and minerals, called micronutrients, are critical for healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.
Infants, children, adolescent girls, women of reproductive age, and pregnant women are the most likely groups to have deficiencies.
CDC is working in the United States around the world to improve micronutrient intake.
The problem
Micronutrient deficiencies can have significant consequences on our health and well-being, yet:
Approximately 1 in 4 US women have iron deficiency during pregnancy.
Approximately 1 in 8 US women ages 12 to 49 have iron deficiency.
Globally more than half of children younger than 5 suffer from vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
Learn More
You can learn more about the 6 essential micronutrients and their roles in healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.
What CDC is doing
Through the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO), CDC works in the United States and around the world to:
Identify and monitor iodine, iron, and anemia levels among groups at risk for deficiencies.
Provide practical strategies for feeding healthy foods and drinks to infants and toddlers.
Work with partners to engage pediatricians in advising on the importance of good nutrition practices for young children.
Help countries:
Develop national-level nutrition surveillance systems and national micronutrient surveys.
Design, monitor, and evaluate interventions such as mass food fortification, home fortification, and micronutrient supplementation.
Build laboratory capacity for vitamin and mineral biomarker monitoring. This is in collaboration with the Nutritional Biomarkers Branch in CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences.
Work with global partners to develop guidelines on vitamin and mineral interventions as well as the assessment of anemia and micronutrient status.
By the numbers
Since 2000, DNPAO has provided technical assistance to more than 60 countries.
DNPAO's ongoing and new surveillance efforts will help fill data gaps in the United States and around the world. Countries use this information to inform, develop, monitor, and evaluate policies and programs, especially for women, infants, young children, and adolescents.

Causal Agents
The microsporidia are a group of unicellular intracellular parasites closely related to fungi, although the nature of the relation to the kingdom Fungi is not clear. The taxonomic position of this group has been debated and revised repeatedly; historically, they were considered protozoa and often remain managed by diagnostic parasitology laboratories. Microsporidia are characterized by the production of resistant spores that vary in size (usually 1—4 µm for medically-important species). They possess a unique organelle, the polar tubule or polar filament, which is coiled inside the spore as demonstrated by its ultrastructure. Microsporidia also possess degenerated mitochondria called mitosomes and lack a conventional Golgi apparatus.
To date, more than 1400 species belonging to over 200 genera have been described as parasites infecting a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. There are at least 15 microsporidian species that have been identified as human pathogens; the vast majority of cases being caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi, followed by some Encephalitozoon species (E. cuniculi, E. hellem, E. intestinalis (=Septata intestinalis)). Other less frequently reported agents include members of the genera Anncaliia (=Brachiola) (A. algerae, A. connori, A. vesicularum), Microsporidium (M. ceylonensis, M. africanum), Trachipleistophora (T. hominis, T. anthropophthera), Nosema ocularum, Pleistophora ronneafiei, Vittaforma corneae (=Nosema corneae), Tubulinosema acridophagus, and an unknown species likely belonging to Endoreticulatus.
Life Cycle
View Larger
The infective form of microsporidia is the resistant spore, which can persist in the environment for months The spore then germinates, rapidly everting its polar tubule which contacts the eukaryotic host cell membrane . The spore then injects the infective sporoplasm into the host cell through the polar tubule . Inside the cell, the sporoplasm enters the proliferative phase marked by extensive multiplication via merogony (binary fission or multiple fission), creating meronts . The location of this developmental stage within the host cell varies by genus; it can occur either in direct contact with the host cell cytosol (Enterocytozoon, Nosema), inside a parasitophorous vacuole of unknown origin (Encephalitozoon), in a parasite-secreted envelope (Pleistophora, Trachipleistophora), or surrounded by the host cell endoplasmic reticulum (Endoreticulatus, Vittaforma) .  Following the proliferative phase, meronts undergo sporogony in which the thick spore wall and invasion apparatus develop, creating sporonts and eventually mature spores when all organelles are polarized. When the spores increase in number and completely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell membrane is disrupted and spores are released to the surroundings . These free mature spores can infect new cells thus continuing the cycle.
Mature spores of intestinal-localizing species may be shed in feces, although the route of transmission remains uncertain for many species. Exposure to spores in water or in soil appears to be a potentially major route, based on the finding of spores in these sources along with case histories. E. bieneusi and V. corneae have been identified in surface waters, and spores of Nosema sp. (and likely A. algerae) have been identified in ditch water. Cases of donor-derived microsporidiosis (Encephalitozoon cuniculi) following bone marrow, kidney, liver, and heart transplantation have been confirmed.
Hosts
Many domestic and wild animals may be naturally infected with various medically-important microsporidia. Enterocytozoon bieneusi is generally considered a human parasite, but has been detected in swine, primates, cattle, cats, dogs, and several other mammals. Some, but not all, of these animal-derived strains appear to represent zoonotic genotypes.
Encephalitozoon cuniculi is endemic in several captive and wild rabbit populations. It has also occasionally been found in domestic dogs, cats, foxes, captive monkeys, and mink. Birds, especially psittacines (parrots, parakeets, love birds, budgerigars, etc.), may represent reservoirs for Encephalitozoon hellem. Unlike the other two important members of the genus, E. intestinalis is only rarely identified in animals other than humans.
The host range of the other microsporidia known to infect humans is not as well known. No animal reservoir has been identified for Vittaforma cornea. Pleistophora spp. are found in fish and reptiles, but spore morphology in these species is inconsistent with that of the species implicated in human infections (P. ronneafiei). Tubulinosema acridophagus, Trachipleistophora spp., and Anncaliia algerae are related to known insect parasites, however, the significance of insects in transmission is unclear.
Geographic Distribution
Microsporidia are being increasingly recognized as opportunistic infectious agents worldwide. Efforts to characterize the global distribution of species and genotypes are ongoing.
Clinical Presentation
Human microsporidiosis represents an important and rapidly emerging opportunistic disease. Historically it has been observed in severely immunocompromised persons, particularly among persons with AIDS, however the implementation of effective anti-retroviral therapies has reduced the incidence in this group considerably. Cases are also known to occur in immunocompetent individuals. The clinical manifestations of microsporidiosis are very diverse, varying according to the causal species and route of infection. Disseminated infection can be fatal. Of all of the manifestations of microsporidiosis, Enterocytozoon bieneusi-associated diarrhea is the most common. Below is a table summarizing the typical sites of infection for various species:

About Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
KEY POINTS
MERS is a viral respiratory illness.
Most MERS cases have been detected in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula.
MERS represents a very low risk to the general public in the United States.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
What it is
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The virus can spread from camels to people through direct physical contact. Limited human-to-human transmission is possible. MERS has caused severe respiratory disease in most diagnosed cases, and many of those patients died. Typical symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Most MERS cases have been detected in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. However, a number of cases linked to travel have been detected in countries outside this region.
Did you know?
CDC does not recommend that anyone change travel plans to, in, or near the Arabian Peninsula because of MERS. For more information about travel guidelines for your destination, visit CDC's Travelers' Health site.
Signs and symptoms
Most people with confirmed MERS-CoV infection have had severe respiratory illness. MERS symptoms usually appear 5 or 6 days after a person is exposed. However, symptoms can appear as early as 2 days and up to 14 days after exposure.
Common symptoms of MERS include:
Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath
Some people may also have diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. It is also possible that someone with MERS may have only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
In most known MERS cases, the infected person developed pneumonia. Additional complications such as kidney failure have also occurred. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 people reported with a MERS infection died.
Most of the people who die from MERS had at least one preexisting medical condition. Certain conditions may increase the risk of getting severe complications from MERS. These include:
Diabetes
Cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure
Chronic lung disease
Chronic heart disease
Chronic kidney disease
Cancer
Contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center
State health department personnel may contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center by email (eocreport@cdc.gov) or phone (770-488-7100) with any questions about MERS PUIs, MERS testing inquiries, or to report any positive MERS testing completed at state or local public health laboratories.
Who is at risk
MERS-CoV Positivity in the US
Only two patients in the United States have ever tested positive for MERS-CoV. Both cases were in May 2014, were linked to travel, and were among healthcare providers who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia.
You may be at increased risk of getting MERS if you:
Recently (in the past 14 days) returned from travel in or near the Arabian Peninsula, and especially if you also:
Worked in or visited a healthcare setting
Had direct physical contact with camels (including touching or grooming)
Had close contact with a person who was sick with fever or respiratory symptoms
Had close contact in the past 14 days with someone who was sick with fever or respiratory symptoms of unknown cause after they had traveled in or near the Arabian Peninsula
Had close contact in the past 14 days with someone who has tested positive for MERS
When to call your healthcare provider
If you develop fever or symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days of the above activities, call a healthcare provider. Tell your healthcare provider about any reason you may be at increased risk for MERS.
How it spreads
The virus that causes MERS can spread through respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucous, of infected animals or people. The MERS-CoV virus is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. People infected through contact with camels can then spread the virus to other people.
Large MERS outbreaks from person-to-person spread have occurred in healthcare facilities treating patients with MERS. Some spread can occur in households through close contact (like sharing a bed or caring for someone who is sick). The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. Multiple healthcare facilities were affected by the outbreak, which was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. All reported person-to-person transmissions of MERS have been linked to a person who had been in or near the Arabian Peninsula.
Researchers continue to investigate clusters of MERS cases to better understand how the virus spreads.
Prevention
No vaccine exists to protect people against MERS.
For travelers, the World Health Organization recommends:
Washing your hands before and after touching camels.
Avoiding drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat (including camel meat) that has not been properly cooked.
Avoiding close contact with camels, if you are at higher risk for severe MERS illness.
Treatment
No specific antiviral treatment is recommended for MERS. People with MERS often receive supportive medical care and care to help relieve symptoms.

Raw Milk
WHAT TO KNOW
Pasteurization is crucial for milk safety, killing harmful germs that can cause illness.
Consuming raw milk can lead to serious health risks, especially for certain vulnerable populations.
Choosing pasteurized milk and dairy products is the best way to safely enjoy the nutritional benefits of milk.
Overview
Raw milk and A(H5N1) virus
CDC recommends against consuming raw milk contaminated with live A(H5N1) virus as a way to develop antibodies against A(H5N1) virus to protect against future disease. Consuming raw milk could make you sick.
Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized, a process that removes disease-causing germs by heating milk to a high enough temperature for a certain length of time. It's important to understand that raw milk can be a source of foodborne illness. While good practices on farms can reduce contamination, they cannot guarantee safety from harmful germs. Pasteurized milk offers the same nutritional benefits without the risks of raw milk consumption. Since the early 1900s, pasteurization has greatly reduced milk-borne illnesses.
Risk
Drinking or eating products made from raw milk can expose people to germs such as Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Listeria, Brucella, and Salmonella.
Some groups, such as children under 5, adults over 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, are at a higher risk of serious illness from these germs.
Symptoms
Symptoms of foodborne illness from raw milk can include diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. In some cases, more severe outcomes like Guillain-Barré syndrome or hemolytic uremic syndrome can occur, potentially leading to paralysis, kidney failure, stroke, or even death.
Prevention
Choose pasteurized milk and dairy products, making sure to read labels carefully.
Refrigerate perishable foods at 40°F or colder to slow bacterial growth. Bacteria can multiply rapidly if left at room temperature or in the “Danger Zone” between 40°F and 140°F. Never leave perishable food out for more than 2 hours (or 1 hour if exposed to temperatures above 90°F, like in a hot car or at a picnic).
Throw away expired or spoiled food. When in doubt, throw it out.

About CDC
AT A GLANCE
CDC is the nation's leading science-based, data-driven, service organization that protects the public's health.
CDC puts science into action to help children stay healthy so they can grow and learn; to help families, businesses, and communities fight disease and stay strong; and to protect the public's health.
Learn more about CDC's mission, priorities, role, and core values.
Our mission
CDC works 24/7 to protect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same.
CDC increases the health security of our nation. As the nation's health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats. To accomplish our mission, CDC conducts critical science and provides health information that protects our nation against expensive and dangerous health threats and responds when these arise.
Priorities
The 2022-2027 CDC Strategic Plan advances science and health equity and affirms the agency's commitment to one unified vision— equitably protecting health, safety, and security. The plan continues to leverage 5 core capabilities of the agency, reflecting our commitment to equity and diversity and lifting up where we have invested through the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work is underscored by the agency's Pledge to the American People and dedication to use timely data and science to drive and communicate customer-centered, high-impact public health action.
CDC Moving Forward
In April 2022, CDC launched an effort to refine and modernize its structures, systems, and processes around developing and deploying our science and programs. The goal was to learn how to pivot our long-standing practices and adapt to pandemics and other public health emergencies, then to apply those lessons across the organization. The effort included a review of key workflows, with a particular focus on ensuring CDC's science reaches the public in an understandable, accessible, and implementable manner as quickly as possible.

Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella (MMRV) Vaccine Safety
SAFETY INFORMATION BY VACCINE |
PAGE 10 OF 18 | ALL PAGES
KEY POINTS
You can protect against these diseases with vaccination.
Overview
Measles causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Complications can include ear infection, diarrhea, pneumonia, brain damage, and death.
Mumps causes fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen salivary glands. Complications can include swelling of the testicles or ovaries, deafness, inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis) and, rarely, death.
Rubella, causes fever, sore throat, rash, headache, and red, itchy eyes. If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage, or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.
Varicella (chickenpox) causes blister-like rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. Complications can include severe skin infection, scars, pneumo­nia, brain damage, or death.
Due to high vaccination rates, outbreaks of measles, mumps, and rubella in the U.S. are not as common as they were before the vaccine began being used. However, these diseases still appear in the U.S. and people who decide not to vaccinate their children because of religious or personal beliefs put their children and others at risk for getting these diseases.

Vaccine Information Statement
Common side effects
Sore arm from the shot.
Fever.
Mild rash.
Some children who get MMRV vaccine may have a febrile seizure after getting the shot. However, these seizures are not common and have not been associated with any long-term problems.
Rarely, the MMRV vaccine can cause swelling of neck or cheeks or a temporary low platelet count.
Extremely rarely, the vaccine's ingredients cause severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions. Children should not get MMRV vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin.
When to call 911
Severe allergic reactions following vaccination are rare, but can be life threatening. If someone experiences symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, which can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness.
Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most people who get MMRV vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Getting MMRV vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella.
Report possible adverse events to VAERS
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is an early warning system, co-managed by CDC and FDA, that monitors for potential vaccine safety problems. Healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers are required by law to report certain adverse events (any side effect or health problem after vaccination that is concerning to you, even if you are not sure if the vaccine caused the event) following vaccination to VAERS; patients and caregivers can also submit reports.
Submitting a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Report and Using VAERS Data
A closer look at the safety data
Before the MMRV vaccine was licensed for use in the United States, researchers studied the vaccine in children aged 12 to 23 months old. The studies found that rash and a fever of 102°F or higher happened more often during the 42 days after the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with separate injections of MMR and varicella vaccines. There is no increased risk of febrile seizures after vaccination with MMRV vaccine in children aged 4 through 6 years. Febrile seizures have not been associated with any long-term effects.
Soreness from the shot was reported less often after MMRV vaccine than after MMR and varicella vaccines given in separate shots at the same visit. For more information, see ""Results from Studies Before MMRV Vaccine Was Licensed.""
Previous studies
VSD MMRV safety study
Background
Through use of CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project's rapid cycle analysis (RCA), scientists can detect adverse events in near real time so that the public can be informed quickly of any possible risks. VSD uses computerized data from managed care organizations, which gather data on vaccination, demographic information, and health outcomes of their patients (more than 8.8 million patients across the country each year).
As part of ongoing efforts to monitor the safety of vaccines, CDC used rapid cycle analysis to study the safety of the MMRV vaccine.
Methods
The study assessed risk for certain health outcomes, including seizures, within 42 days after vaccination among children aged 12-23 months who received MMRV vaccine. This is the age when the first dose is recommended for the MMRV vaccine as well as for the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines. Investigators looked at how often certain outcomes occurred among children in the MMRV vaccine group compared with children who received MMR vaccine (many children also received varicella vaccine) mainly in the period before MMRV vaccine was available.
An increased risk for seizures of any cause was detected. The seizures were clustered around 7-10 days after vaccination in both groups (MMRV vaccine [1 shot] and MMR and varicella vaccines [2 separate shots] administered at the same visit).
Investigators reviewed the medical charts of children identified in the database as having had seizures 7-10 days after receiving an MMRV vaccine or MMR and varicella vaccines to distinguish febrile seizures from other kinds of seizures.
Investigators used statistical methods to compare rates of febrile seizures among children in two study groups: 1) children who received an MMRV vaccine during January 2006 -October 2008; and 2) children who received separate injections of MMR and varicella vaccines at the same visit during January 2000 -October 2008.
Results
Only children aged 12-23 months who received the first dose were studied. This information was presented at the June 2009 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting.
The study included 83,107 children who received their first dose of MMRV vaccine and 376,354 children who received their first doses of MMR and varicella vaccines administered at the same visit.
Of the children identified in the computerized data as having seizures 7-10 days after vaccination, about 90% were found to be febrile seizures after chart review.
The rates of febrile seizures that occurred 7-10 days after vaccination were 8.5 per 10,000 in the MMRV vaccine group compared with 4.2 per 10,000 in the MMR and varicella vaccine group. Thus, the risk was about 2 times higher in children who received the single shot vs. the two separate shots.
7-10 days after vaccination, about one additional febrile seizure would be expected to occur for every 2,300 children who receive an MMRV vaccine compared with children vaccinated with MMR and varicella vaccines at the same visit.
A similar percentage of children with febrile seizures in the MMRV vaccine group (30%) and the MMR and varicella vaccine group (29%) had a family history of seizures.
VSD MMRV vaccine safety studies among children aged 12-23 months
Before MMRV vaccine was licensed
Two adverse events occurred more frequently during the 42 days after the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with separate injections of MMR and varicella vaccines—a fever of 102° F or higher and rash. Most of the risk for fever and rash was in the 5-12 days after vaccination. These conditions typically resolved on their own.
Soreness at the injection site was reported less often after MMRV vaccine than after MMR and varicella vaccines given in separate shots at the same visit. The rates of adverse events after MMRV vaccination were:
Soreness at injection site: 1 child out of 5.
Fever: 1 child out of 5.
Rash: 1 child out of 20.
The rates of adverse events for MMR and varicella vaccines administered at the same visit were:
Soreness at injection site: 1 child out of 4.
Fever: 1 child out of 7.
Rash: 1 child out of 25.
Because these studies showed an increased risk for fever after MMRV vaccination, compared with vaccination with MMR and varicella vaccines in separate shots at the same visit, there was concern about a potential increased risk for febrile seizures (seizures triggered by a rising or dropping fever) after MMRV vaccination. As part of routine monitoring of vaccine safety for all new vaccines, CDC conducted studies of the safety of MMRV vaccine. In these studies, CDC analyzed data reported to the VSD regarding MMRV vaccine given to children aged 12-23 months, the age when the first dose of MMRV or MMR and varicella vaccines is recommended. The study assessed the rate of several medical events after MMRV vaccination, including febrile seizures.
After MMRV vaccine was licensed
7-10 days after the first dose of vaccination, the rate of febrile seizures was about 2 times higher among children who received MMRV vaccine (8.5 per 10,000 children vaccinated) than among children who received measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines separately at the same visit (4.2 per 10,000 children vaccinated), mainly before MMRV vaccine became available.
7-10 days after vaccination, about one additional febrile seizure would be expected to occur among every 2,300 children vaccinated with first-dose MMRV vaccine compared with children vaccinated with the first doses of MMR and varicella shots at the same visit.
Merck, the manufacturer of the MMRV vaccine, also sponsored an observational study (after MMRV vaccine was licensed) of febrile seizures after the first dose of MMRV vaccine was given to children aged 12-23 months. Here are some key findings from that study:
The rate of febrile seizures 5-12 days after first dose of vaccination was 7.0 per 10,000 children who received MMRV vaccine compared with a rate of 3.2 per 10,000 children who received measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines separately at the same visit (3.2 is the rate before MMRV vaccine became available).
5-12 days after vaccination, about one additional febrile seizure would be expected to occur among every 2,600 children vaccinated with the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with children vaccinated with the first doses of MMR and varicella vaccines administered at the same visit.
These findings and other relevant data were presented to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). In May 2010, CDC released new recommendations on the use of MMRV vaccine.

MMRV Vaccine and Febrile Seizures
Background
The study, ""Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella Combination Vaccine and the Risk of Febrile Seizures"" uses computerized information from CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project. VSD consists of managed care organizations which gather vaccination and demographic information, as well as health outcomes of their patients (more than 9.2 million across the U.S.)
Researchers examined VSD data on more than 83,000 children who received their first dose of MMRV vaccine and over 376,000 children who received their first doses of MMR and varicella vaccines given at the same visit from the year 2000 to the year 2008.
Main findings1
For MMRV combination vaccine, there was 1 additional febrile seizure for every 2,300 doses given, compared to separate MMR plus varicella vaccines in the 7 to 10 days following vaccination.
Of the children identified as having seizures following the 7 to 10-day vaccination period, about 90% were found to be febrile seizures.
The rate of seizures in this timeframe was 85 per 1000 person-years in the MMRV vaccine group compared to 42 per 1000 in the MMR and varicella vaccine group. This risk was about 2 times higher in children who received the combination shot (MMRV) versus the single shots (MMR and varicella).
Conclusions
CDC recommends providers who choose to use the combination MMRV vaccine be aware of and clearly communicate to parents and caregivers the increased risk of fever and seizure within the 7 to 10 days following vaccination.
Parents should be educated on the risk of seizure following the combination MMRV vaccine and know their options. Most children recover quickly from febrile seizures and have no lasting effects.
How CDC monitors vaccine safety
CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are committed to ensuring that vaccines provided to the public are safe and effective. Once vaccines are licensed or authorized for emergency use in the United States, CDC and FDA continuously monitor them through several safety systems.

About The Model Aquatic Health Code
KEY POINTS
CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is guidance to prevent injury and illness at aquatic venues open to the public.
This guidance brings together the latest science and best practices to help jurisdictions save time and resources when they develop and update pool codes, addressing topics like building aquatic facilities and lifeguard training.
Overview
CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is guidance to prevent injury and illness linked to aquatic venues — such as pools, hot tubs, and splash pads — open to the public. This guidance brings together the latest science and best practices to help jurisdictions save time and resources when they develop and update pool codes. Pool codes regulate how aquatic venues that are open to the public are designed, constructed, operated, and managed. These codes address topics such as how aquatic facilities are built, how lifeguards are trained and certified, and how chlorine levels in the water are tested.
The MAHC applies to aquatic venues open to the public. These venues can be operated by:
Hotels and motels
Apartment complexes
Homeowners' associations
Membership clubs (for example, gyms)
Schools
Waterparks
CDC works with the Council for the Model Aquatic Health Code (CMAHC)
to ensure the Model Aquatic Health Code stays current. The CMAHC regularly collects, assesses, and relays national input on needed MAHC revisions.
The 2023 MAHC provides guidance for public aquatic venues to help prevent injury and illness.
Why it's important
The primary objective of the MAHC is to prevent injuries and illnesses at pools, hot tubs, and splash pads open to the public, including:
Drowning
More children ages 1–4 die from drowning than any other cause of death. For children ages 5–14, drowning is the second leading cause of death from unintentional injury after motor vehicle crashes.
Pool chemical injuries
Pool chemical injuries account for about 4,500 emergency department visits each year. At least one third of the patients are under 18 years old.
Disease outbreaks linked to swimming
Over 200 disease outbreaks linked to pools, hot tubs, and splash pads occurred during 2015–2019. The leading cause of these outbreaks was Cryptosporidium. This parasite is very chlorine tolerant and can cause outbreaks that can sicken hundreds or even thousands of people.
Public pool and hot tub/spa closings because of public health hazards
One out of eight routine public pool inspections and one out of seven routine public hot tub or spa inspections result in immediate closure because of at least one violation representing a serious threat to public health.
Background
Most health departments and related agencies have programs to help ensure swimmers and aquatics staff stay safe and healthy. Previously, each individual agency had to do its own research to develop or update pool codes because no single science-based reference existed at the national level. This means pool codes can greatly vary across the United States.
CDC created the MAHC at the request of health departments and the aquatics sector to provide scientifically based guidance at the national level. The first edition of the MAHC was released in 2014 and it has been updated every few years since then. The MAHC helps jurisdictions save the time and resources previously used to develop and update their codes themselves.
Policy
The MAHC is not a federal law. The MAHC is a CDC guidance document and only becomes law if voluntarily adopted by a local, state, territorial, or tribal jurisdiction. This means jurisdictions can:
Choose to adopt all of it or parts of it
Modify part or all of it to fit their needs
Use it as a reference
Aquatics sector leaders can also work with health departments to use the MAHC to make swimming and other water activities safer and healthier, even if the jurisdiction has not yet adopted the MAHC.

Mold
WHAT TO KNOW
Mold can look like spots of many different colors, and it can smell musty. If you see or smell mold, you should remove it.
If mold is growing in your home, you need to clean up the mold and fix the moisture problem.
Learn what mold is, how to prevent it, and how to clean it up.
Overview
There is always some mold around. Molds have been on the Earth for millions of years. Mold can get in your home through open doors, windows, vents, and heating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can be brought indoors on clothing, shoes, bags, and even pets.
Mold will grow where there is moisture, such as around leaks in roofs, windows, or pipes, or where there has been a flood. Mold grows on paper, cardboard, ceiling tiles, and wood. Mold can also grow in dust, paints, wallpaper, insulation, drywall, carpet, fabric, and upholstery.
Common types
The most common indoor molds are Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus.
Mold is found both indoors and outdoors. Mold can enter your home through open doorways, windows, vents, and heating and air conditioning systems. Mold in the air outside can also attach itself to clothing, shoes, and pets can and be carried indoors.
When mold spores drop on places with excessive moisture, such as where leakage may have occurred in roofs, pipes, walls, plant pots, or where there has been flooding, they will grow.
Possible health effects
Exposure to damp and moldy environments may cause a variety of health effects, or none at all.
For some people, mold can cause a stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing or wheezing, burning eyes, or skin rash. People with asthma or who are allergic to mold may have severe reactions. Immune-compromised people and people with chronic lung disease may get infections in their lungs from mold. For people who are sensitive to molds exposure to molds can lead to symptoms such as stuffy nose, wheezing, and red or itchy eyes, or skin. Severe reactions, such as fever or shortness of breath, may occur among workers exposed to large amounts of molds in occupational settings, such as farmers working around moldy hay.
In 2004 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found there was sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure to mold with upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheeze in otherwise healthy people; with asthma symptoms in people with asthma; and with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in individuals susceptible to that immune-mediated condition.
In 2009, the World Health Organization issued additional guidance, the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould. Other recent studies have suggested a potential link of early mold exposure to development of asthma in some children, particularly among children who may be genetically susceptible to asthma development, and that selected interventions that improve housing conditions can reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies.
Preventing
There are steps you can take to prevent mold growth in your home.
Keep humidity levels in your home as low as you can — no higher than 50% — all day long. An air conditioner or dehumidifier will help you keep the level low.
Be sure the air in your home flows freely. Use exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom that vent to outside your home. Make sure your clothes dryer vents outside your home.
Fix any leaks in your home's roof, walls, or plumbing so mold does not have moisture to grow.
Clean up and dry out your home fully and quickly (within 24–48 hours) after a flood.
Add mold inhibitors to paints before painting. You can buy mold inhibitors at paint and home improvement stores.
Clean bathrooms with mold-killing products.
Remove or replace carpets and upholstery that have been soaked and cannot be dried right away. Don't use carpet in places like bathrooms or basements that may have a lot of moisture.
Cleaning
If you see or smell mold, you should remove it. You do not need to know the type of mold. If mold is growing in your home, you need to clean up the mold and fix the moisture problem.
Mold can be removed from hard surfaces with household products, soap and water, or a bleach solution of no more than 1 cup of household laundry bleach in 1 gallon of water.
If you use bleach
Never mix bleach with ammonia or other cleaners. This will produce a poisonous gas.
Follow manufacturers' instructions when you use bleach or any other cleaning product.
Open windows and doors to provide fresh air.
Wear rubber boots, rubber gloves, and goggles during cleanup.

Home testing
CDC does not recommend mold testing.
The health effects of mold are different for different people so you cannot rely on sampling and culturing to know whether someone might become sick. No matter what type of mold is present, you need to remove it.
Also, good sampling for mold can be expensive, and there are no set standards for what is and what is not an acceptable quantity of different kinds of mold in a home. The best thing you can do is to safely remove the mold and prevent future mold growth.
Molluscum Contagiosum

MAY 13, 2024
About Molluscum Contagiosum
KEY POINTS
Molluscum contagiosum is an infection that causes small, raised sores on your body.
You can catch the disease if you touch someone else who has it.
You can also get it if you touch surfaces or objects that have been touched by someone with molluscum.
Molluscum contagiosum mostly occurs in kids ages 1 to 10.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Molluscum contagiosum is very common in the United States. It's so common you shouldn't be surprised if you or your family catch it. Anyone can get infected, but it's most common in children between 1 and 10 years old.
The infection is usually mild and goes away without any treatment. You can catch the infection more than once in your lifetime if you're around someone who has it.
Signs and symptoms
Molluscum contagiosum causes small, raised bumps that:
Usually look white, pink or the same color as your skin
Feel firm, sometimes with a dip in the center
Appear anywhere on your body
Are about the size of a pinhead to a pencil eraser
The sores may be itchy, sore, red, or swollen. They typically go away in six months to a year. But they can also take longer to resolve. They usually don't leave scars.
Risk factors
You are at increased risk for getting the disease if you:
Have a weakened immune system (such as from HIV or cancer).
Have eczema.
Live in warm, humid climates with crowded living conditions.
How it spreads
You can get mollsucum if you touch someone who has it. It can also spread when you touch items that have the virus on it. Examples include towels, clothing, toys, or pool equipment used by someone who has molluscum.
If you have molluscum, you can spread it to other areas of your body. This can happen if you touch or scratch the sores, shave over them or have hair removal procedures on the area.
You can also catch molluscum if you have sex with someone who has it. Many molluscum infections in adults occur this way.
Treatment and recovery
Healthy people usually recover from molluscum without treatment. So, treatment isn't usually needed.
One exception is if you have sores around your genitals (penis, vulva, vagina, or anus). In this case, treatment is usually recommended. See a healthcare provider as soon as you can. They can determine if the sores are caused by molluscum or another disease. They can also suggest appropriate treatment.
Be aware that some treatments available on the internet may not be effective and may be harmful.
Do not try and remove the sores or the fluid inside them yourself. This can spread the infection to other areas of your body. It can also cause the sores to become infected.

About B Virus
KEY POINTS
B virus infection is extremely rare but can be serious and even deadly.
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people.
If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, begin first aid immediately and see a healthcare provider.
What it is
B virus infection is extremely rare. However, it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately.
People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms typically start within one month of being exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days.
The first indications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, you may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey.
As the disease progresses, the virus spreads to and causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain and spinal cord. Problems with breathing and death can occur one day to three weeks after symptoms appear.
Keep Reading:
B Virus Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
Most people will not come in contact with monkeys, so their risk of getting infected with B virus is very low.
However, laboratory workers, veterinarians, and people more likely exposed to macaque monkeys have a higher risk of getting B virus infection.
Keep Reading:
Risk Factors for B Virus
How it spreads
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. You can get infected with B virus if you:
Are bitten or scratched by an infected monkey.
Get an infected monkey's tissue or fluid on your broken skin or in your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Have a needle stick by a contaminated syringe.
Scratch or cut yourself on a contaminated cage or other sharp-edged surface.
Are exposed to the brain (especially), spinal cord, or skull of an infected monkey.
Keep Reading:
B Virus: Causes and How It Spreads
Prevention
There are no vaccines that can protect you against B virus infection.
If you are in a place with macaque monkeys, stay away from them so that you don't get bitten or scratched. You should not touch or feed monkeys.
People at increased risk should follow appropriate laboratory and animal facility protocols to reduce the spread of B virus.
Treatment and recovery
Get first aid immediately
If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, get first aid and seek immediate medical attention. Follow the steps below.
Thoroughly wash the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey and gently scrub with soap, detergent, or iodine for 15 minutes.
Run water over the wound or area for 15 to 20 minutes more.
Tell the healthcare provider that you have been exposed to a macaque monkey that may be infected with B virus.
If you got exposed to a macaque, wash right away and tell your doctor.
Medications
If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus exposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and treatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease.
How animals are affected
Macaque monkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they reach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do not have symptoms, or have just mild disease.

About Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
KEY POINTS
EBV is one of the most common human viruses in the world and spreads through bodily fluids, primarily saliva.
EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses.
There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection.
What it is
Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, is one of the most common human viruses in the world. EBV is also known as human herpesvirus 4 and is a member of the herpes virus family.
Most people will get infected with EBV in their lifetime, especially in childhood, and will not have symptoms. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses.
About mononucleosis
EBV is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis, also called ""mono."" This contagious disease is common among teens and adults.
Learn more
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of EBV infection can include:
Fatigue
Fever
Inflamed throat
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
Enlarged spleen
Swollen liver
Rash
People who get symptoms from EBV infection, usually teenagers or adults, get better in 2 to 4 weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several weeks or even months.
Who is at risk
After you get an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent (inactive) in your body. In some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates.
How it spreads
You can spread the virus for weeks!
When you first get EBV, you can spread it for weeks and even before you have symptoms. Once EBV is in your body, it stays inactive. If it reactivates, you can potentially infect others no matter how much time has passed since the first infection.
EBV is most commonly spread through saliva by:
Kissing
Sharing drinks and food
Sharing drinking cups, eating utensils, or toothbrushes
Having contact with toys that children have drooled on
The virus probably survives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist.
EBV can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations.
Prevention
There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. You can help protect yourself by reducing contact with people who have EBV infection.
Make sure you avoid:
Kissing
Sharing drinks and food
Using the same personal items that an infected person recently used
Testing and diagnosis
Diagnosing EBV infection can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to other illnesses. EBV infection can be confirmed with a blood test that detects antibodies. About 9 out of 10 adults have antibodies that show that they have a current or past EBV infection.
Keep Reading:
Laboratory Testing for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
Treatment and recovery
Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. There is no specific treatment for EBV. However, some things can be done to help relieve symptoms such as:
Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
Getting plenty of rest
Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever

Vaccine Basics
WHAT TO KNOW
Modern vaccines contain only the ingredients that are needed for the vaccines to be as safe and effective as possible.
Every vaccine ingredient serves a purpose
To provide immunity
We become immune to (or protected from) a disease when our bodies create specific antibodies to fight that disease. Vaccines contain ingredients that help your body build this immunity.
To keep the vaccine safe and long-lasting
Vaccines need to be safe and effective. Certain ingredients help keep vaccines safe from contamination and toxins. Others, like stabilizers, help vaccines stay effective for a long time.
To make the vaccine more effective
All vaccine ingredients help to make a vaccine as effective as possible, while being safe. Ingredients like aluminum salt help boost the body's response to the vaccine.
Ingredients found in some vaccines
Stabilizers
Purpose: To keep the vaccine effective after manufacturing
Most commonly found in: Jell-O®, naturally in the body
Examples: Sugars, gelatin
Adjuvants
Purpose: To help boost the body's response to the vaccine
Most commonly found in: Drinking water, infant formula, and some health products such as antacids, buffered aspirin, and antiperspirants
Examples: Aluminum salts
Residual inactivating ingredients
Purpose: To kill viruses or inactivate toxins during the manufacturing process
Most commonly found in: Naturally in the human body, fruit, household furnishings (carpets, upholstering)
Example: FormaldehydeA
Residual cell culture materials
Purpose: To grow enough of the virus or bacteria to make the vaccine
Most commonly found in: Eggs, and foods that contain eggs
Examples: Egg proteinB
Residual antibiotics
Purpose: To prevent contamination by bacteria during the vaccine manufacturing process
Most commonly found in: Common antibiotics. Antibiotics that people are most likely to be allergic to—like penicillin—aren't used in vaccines.
Examples: Neomycin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin
Preservatives
Purpose: To prevent contamination
Most commonly found in: Some kinds of fish
Example: ThimerosalC (only in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine)
Most vaccines don't contain any mercury
Most vaccines do not have any mercury in them. However, multi-dose flu vaccines and one type of tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine contain a small amount of thimerosal. Thimerosal contains a form of mercury (ethylmercury) that does not cause mercury poisoning and is safe for use in vaccines. Flu and Td vaccines are also available in thimerosal-free versions.
Different types of vaccines work in different ways
Vaccines can help protect against certain diseases by imitating an infection. This helps teach the immune system how to build immunity to fight off a future infection. Different vaccines provide immunity in different ways.
Ingredients in specific vaccines
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is responsible for making sure vaccines are safe and effective, has information about all approved vaccines. Check out the below links to discover the different vaccine options and the various ingredients.
Learn about the vaccines that are currently approved in the U.S. by the FDA to prevent different diseases.

Overview
Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is a very common germ. About one out of every three people have the germ on their skin or in their nose. This germ does not cause problems for most people.
MRSA is a type of staph that can be resistant to several antibiotics. Anyone can get a MRSA infection or carry MRSA. The risk increases for people with hospitalizations or nursing home stays, skin-to-skin contact with others (such as in contact sports), and exposure to crowded and unhygienic places.

Clinical Overview of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Healthcare Settings
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of an S. aureus infection, including MRSA, depend on the part of the body that is infected. Broken skin, such as scrapes or cuts, is often the site of a MRSA infection. Most S. aureus skin infections, including MRSA, appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that might be:
Red.
Swollen.
Painful.
Warm to the touch.
Full of pus or other drainage.
Accompanied by a fever.
You cannot tell by looking at the skin if it's a MRSA infection. People sometimes confuse some MRSA skin infections with a spider bite. However, unless you actually see the spider, the irritation is likely not a spider bite.
If you or someone in your family experiences the signs and symptoms of MRSA infection:
Contact your healthcare provider, especially if the symptoms include a fever or do not improve within 48 hours.

Do not pick at or pop the bump or sore.

Cover the area with clean, dry bandages until you can see a healthcare provider.

Clean your hands often.
Complications
MRSA infections can cause serious problems in and outside of healthcare settings, including:
Pneumonia (lung infections).
Bloodstream infections.
Surgical site infections.
Sepsis, the body's extreme response to an infection (if left untreated).
Death (if left untreated).
Who is at risk
Although anyone can get MRSA, some groups have a higher risk:
Athletes.
Daycare and school students.
Military personnel in barracks.
People who receive inpatient medical care.
People who have surgery or medical devices inserted in their body.
People who inject drugs.
How it spreads
MRSA spreads in the community through contact with infected people, wounds, or things that have touched infected skin and are carrying the bacteria.
Some people who carry MRSA can go on to get a MRSA infection.
Prevention
You can reduce your risk of MRSA infections and help prevent their spread.

Preventing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
Diagnosis
A healthcare provider must send a clinical specimen to a laboratory to determine if MRSA is the cause of an infection.
Treatment and recovery
Healthcare providers often prescribe antibiotics to treat MRSA infections. Some types of S. aureus infections need surgery to drain infected areas. Your healthcare provider will determine which treatments are best for you. While MRSA can be resistant to several antibiotics, meaning these drugs cannot cure the infections, there are antibiotics available to treat MRSA infections.
What CDC is doing
Tracking MRSA infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by MRSA and slow the spread of resistant germs.

Mucormycosis Basics
KEY POINTS
Mucormycosis is a serious but rare fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes.
Mucormycosis mainly affects people with weakened immune systems.
It most commonly affects the sinuses or the lungs.
It can also occur on the skin after a cut, burn, or other type of skin injury.
Overview
Mucormycosis, sometimes called zygomycosis, is a rare but serious fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. These molds are common in the environment and most people are exposed to them every day without getting sick.
Usually, only people with weakened immune systems (lower ability to fight infections) get mucormycosis.
People can get exposed to mucormycetes different ways, causing different types of infections and symptoms. Murcormycosis can be deadly and requires treatment with antifungal medications. Mucormycosis is one of the most common diseases linked to mold outbreaks in healthcare settings.
Health Care Providers:
Clinical Overview of Mucormycosis
Symptoms
Mucormycosis symptoms depend on which part of the body is affected. It can affect sinuses, brain, lungs, skin, stomach and intestines, or cause symptoms throughout the body. Mucormycosis most commonly affects the sinuses or the lungs and causes symptoms like cough, nasal congestion, and fever. Symptoms of skin infections include blisters and burns.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Mucormycosis
Causes and Risk
People with weakened immune systems can get mucormycosis from breathing in spores from mucormycetes. it can also be caused by eating something with the spores on it or from spores infecting a scrape or wound.
Some of these conditions that increase the risk for infection include:
Cancer
Organ or stem cell transplant
Wounds or burns.
Mucormycetes are often found in soil and in decaying organic matter, such as leaves, compost piles, or rotten wood.
Mucormycosis does not spread from person to person.
Usually, only people with weakened immune systems get mucormycosis.
Healthcare facilities
Outbreaks of invasive mold infections have occurred in healthcare facilities. Mold is found in all environments. Patients receiving medical care are more likely to have weakened immune systems and be at risk. Mold outbreaks have occurred through air filtration systems, water leaks, and in dampened hospital linens.
Public Health:
Guidance for Healthcare-Associated Mold Outbreaks
Testing and treatment
Healthcare providers test for mucormycosis by taking samples of affected tissue, fluid from the lungs, or nasal discharge. Samples are tested at a laboratory.
Antifungal medications are needed to treat mucormycosis. Sometimes surgery is needed to cut and remove infected tissues.

About Common Cold
KEY POINTS
Different respiratory viruses can cause a cold.
You can get a cold any time of year.
Colds usually last less than a week.
Overview
A cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (also called an upper respiratory infection or URI). Colds usually last less than a week and are caused by different respiratory viruses. They are also one of the most frequent reasons for missed school and work. Every year in the United States, adults have an average of two to three colds, and children often have more.
Signs and symptoms
The signs and symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days of infection and can include:
Runny nose or nasal congestion
Cough
Sneezing
Sore throat
Headache
Mild body aches
Fever (usually low grade in older children and adults)
Complications
Complications from infection with respiratory viruses can include:
Mild to moderate:
Middle ear infections (infection behind the ear drum)
Sinus infections
Potentially severe:
Asthma attacks (wheezing, difficulty breathing)
Bronchiolitis (infection of the small airways)
Bronchitis (infection of the large airways)
Pneumonia (infection of the lungs)
Worsening of chronic medical conditions (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure)
Some respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, can have serious outcomes. Outcomes can include hospitalization or death, especially among groups at increased risk for severe illness. This includes infants, older adults, or those with underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems.
Causes and spread
Causes
More than 200 respiratory viruses can cause colds. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause of colds in the United States. Other respiratory viruses that can cause colds in the United States include common human coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses (including EV-D68), and human metapneumovirus.
SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza virus (the virus that causes flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also cause cold-like symptoms but do not cause colds. These respiratory viruses are more likely to cause severe illness. If you have cold-like symptoms and suspect you have COVID-19 or flu, get tested, especially if you're at higher risk for severe illness. Antiviral treatments are available for COVID-19 and flu and work best when started very soon after symptoms begin.
Spread
Different respiratory viruses spread in different ways. Most respiratory viruses are spread through droplets that an infected person releases when they cough or sneeze. These droplets can enter your body if you breathe them in or touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Some viruses can also spread through close personal contact, such as shaking hands with an infected person and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
You can get a cold any time of year. Many respiratory viruses, like influenza virus and RSV, usually circulate during winter, but other viruses that can also cause cold symptoms circulate during spring, summer, or fall.
Tip
You can take steps to reduce your risk of getting a respiratory virus or spreading one to others. Read CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance.

About Mumps
KEY POINTS
Mumps is a contagious viral infection that can be serious.
Common symptoms include painful swelling of the jaw, fever, tiredness, appetite loss, and headache.
Get vaccinated for mumps with the MMR vaccine, especially before travelling internationally.
What it is
Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus that affects the salivary glands. Mumps is still a common disease in many countries, so it's important to get vaccinated to protect yourself. Most people with mumps recover completely within 2 weeks.
Signs and symptoms
People who are infected with mumps don’t get sick right away. It can take 2 to 4 weeks for them to show signs of infection.
Common signs of mumps are puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw. This is caused by the swollen salivary glands under one or both ears. Early symptoms can begin a few days before the swelling. The most serious complication is brain inflammation of the brain.
Some people who have been vaccinated against mumps can still get the disease. However, they usually have milder symptoms and complications are less frequent.
Keep Reading:
Mumps Symptoms and Complications
Who is at risk
Anyone who is not protected against mumps is at risk of getting the disease.
Some groups of people have a higher likelihood of spreading disease because they are constantly in close contact with each other. These include school-aged children, students at post-high school educational institutions, and healthcare personnel.
People traveling internationally to areas where mumps is still common, or people near outbreaks, are also more likely to get mumps.
How it spreads
Alert others if you are infected with mumps!
Let your doctor know right away if you think you or someone in your family may have mumps. Limit your contact with others for up to 5 days after swelling begins. Stay home from school, work, and do not attend social events.
Mumps is a contagious disease caused by the mumps virus. It spreads through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from the mouth, nose, or throat.
You can get mumps and spread the virus by:
Coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Sharing items that may have saliva on them, such as water bottles or cups.
Participating in close-contact activities with others, like playing sports, dancing, or kissing.
When people are contagious
A person infected with mumps can spread it:
Beginning a few days before their salivary glands begin to swell.
Until up to 5 days after swelling begins.
Prevention
Protect yourself with the vaccine. Getting two doses of the mumps vaccine is the best protection against mumps. It's usually given as a combination vaccine called measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which protects against all three diseases. Your child’s doctor may also offer the MMRV vaccine, a combination vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox).
After the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States.

Mustard Gas
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Sulfur mustard is a human-made chemical warfare agent that can cause skin blisters and damage to multiple parts of the body.
Usually, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
If sulfur mustard was swallowed, do not force vomiting.
Background
Sulfur mustard is a human-made chemical warfare agent that causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. This type of chemical warfare agent is called a vesicant or blistering agent.
Sulfur mustard is known as ""mustard gas,"" ""mustard agent,"" or by the military designation ""H"" or ""HD.""
Traits of mustard gas include:
Solid at less than 58° Fahrenheit
Oily-textured liquid at room temperature
Clear to yellow or brown when liquid or solid
Smells like garlic, onions, mustard, or no smell
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms depend on how the person was exposed, the amount of sulfur mustard, and how long they were exposed.
If you're in immediate danger
If sulfur mustard was swallowed, do not force vomiting.
Usually, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately. It may take up to 24 hours for some symptoms to occur. Sulfur mustard can have different effects on specific parts of the body.
Circulatory
Circulatory (heart and blood) signs and symptoms include decreased formation of blood cells and platelets. This can lead to weakness, bleeding, and infections.
Digestive
Digestive signs and symptoms include:
Diarrhea
Nausea
Vomiting
Eyes
Eye signs and symptoms include:
Eye irritation
Eye swelling
Eye pain
Eye tearing
Temporary blindness
Respiratory
Respiratory (breathing) signs and symptoms include:
Difficulty breathing
Cough
Shortness of breath
Sneezing
Wheezing
Hoarseness
Skin
Skin signs and symptoms include:
Blistering of skin, yellow in color
Skin itching
Skin pain
Skin redness
Other signs and symptoms include:
Abdominal pain
Bloody or runny nose
Sinus (nose) pain
Exposure to large amounts of sulfur mustard:
Convulsions (uncontrollable muscle shaking)
Light sensitivity
Insomnia (sleep disorder)
Permanent or temporary blindness
Respiratory (breathing) failure leading to death
Exposure
Sulfur mustard can last 1 to 2 days in the environment in average weather conditions. Sulfur mustard can last weeks to months in very cold conditions.
Follow any directions by local authorities.
Air
If sulfur mustard is in the air, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing it in. Because sulfur mustard gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase chances of exposure there. Do not stay in lower areas.
Clothes
If clothing touched sulfur mustard, people can be exposed by touching or breathing in sulfur mustard gas from the clothing.
Food
Eating, drinking, or touching food or drink with sulfur mustard can expose people to sulfur mustard. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual.
Do not eat food that may have touched sulfur mustard if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken and sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected. Wash the outside of the container before using.
Water
If sulfur mustard is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking the water. People can also be exposed by swallowing liquid sulfur mustard, getting it on their skin, or getting it in their eyes.
What to do if you are exposed
Get away
Get away from the area where the sulfur mustard was released and breathe fresh air.
If the sulfur mustard release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the sulfur mustard does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the sulfur mustard was released.
If the sulfur mustard release was indoors, get out of the building and go to higher ground.
If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible. Sulfur mustard is heavier than air and will sink to lower areas.
Resource
Make sure you understand your local emergency notification system if you have one. Listen to emergency broadcasts and local authorities for instructions.
Get clean
Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories, blotting any liquid, and showering. Ideally, undress, blot, and shower immediately or as soon as you can, as described below. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can.
Take off your clothes
Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the sulfur mustard from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag.
If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in.
Follow these steps to blot your body:
Use different dry, clean cloths, or paper towels to blot each part of your body where you feel liquid.
Start blotting with your head and hair.
Then blot your face, hands, body, arms, legs, and feet.
Blot your skin for 10 seconds.
Rub for 10 seconds any places on your skin or in your hair where you can see or feel liquid.
Drop the used cloths or towels to the floor.
Repeat the process several times if you still feel liquid on you. Use a different clean cloth or towel for each part of your body. Use a different clean cloth or towel each time you repeat the process.
Wash your body
Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet with a lot of lukewarm water and mild soap (if available) for 90 seconds. Use soapy water for a minute, then rinse with plain water for 30 seconds. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub!
If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10 to 15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops.
Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool.
Clear the dirty items
If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams. Move as far from the used items as possible.
Otherwise, put on waterproof or heavy gloves that won't let liquid go through. Gather all used things from the floor, including your clothes, and put them in a plastic bag. Remove gloves and put them in the plastic bag. Close the plastic bag and place it in a second plastic bag. Close up the second bag also.
Do not put the bags in the regular trash! Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch sulfur mustard. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up.
Get help
Get help right away by:
Calling 911.
Going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave.
Calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.
Keep Reading:
Responding to Chemical Emergencies
Treatment
No known cure exists for sulfur mustard exposure.
Treatment involves removing sulfur mustard from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Supportive medical care can be given in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel.
Long-term health effects
Exposure to sulfur mustard usually does not often cause death. Sulfur mustard use during World War 1 killed fewer than 5% of the people who were exposed and got medical care.
Eye exposure may cause temporary or permanent eye injury or chronic (long-term) eye infections.
Skin exposure to sulfur mustard may cause the following long-term effects:
Second- and third-degree burns
Skin scarring
Pigment (color) changes
Skin cancer.
Breathing in sulfur mustard may cause the following long-term effects:
Loss of taste and smell
Chronic respiratory (breathing) disease

ME/CFS Basics
KEY POINTS
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious and often long-lasting illness that keeps people from doing their usual activities.
It makes physical and mental exertion difficult.
Symptoms include trouble thinking, severe tiredness and other symptoms.
There is no known cause or cure. Care usually means treating the symptoms that most affect a person's life.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
ME/CFS is a biological illness that affects many body parts. It causes severe fatigue not improved by rest, problems thinking and sleeping, dizziness, pain, and many other symptoms.
People with ME/CFS may not look sick but can't do their normal activities. ME/CFS may get worse after they do any activity -- physical or mental. This symptom is called post-exertional malaise (PEM). After they exert themselves, they may need to stay in bed for an extended time. About 1 in 4 people with ME/CFS are confined to bed at some point in their illness.
Did you know?
It's estimated that up to 3.3 million people in the United States suffer from ME/CFS. More than 9 in 10 people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed by a doctor. ME/CFS costs the U.S. economy about $18 to $51 billion annually in medical costs and lost income.
It is difficult to diagnose because there is no specific test for ME/CFS. One reason that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed may be limited access to healthcare. Another reason may be a lack of healthcare providers who know about ME/CFS and how to recognize it.
Anyone can get ME/CFS. It doesn't matter what age, gender or ethnicity they are. However, some groups are more affected than others.
Signs and symptoms
People with ME/CFS are not able to function the same way they did before they became ill. They may not always be able to do daily tasks like showering or cooking a meal.
ME/CFS often makes it hard to keep a job, go to school, and take part in family and social life. ME/CFS can last for years and sometimes leads to serious disability.
ME/CFS is most common in people in middle age but also affects kids, teens and elderly people. Among adults, women are affected more often than men. Among children, teens are more affected than younger kids.
People who are white are diagnosed more often than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, especially among people from racial and ethnic minority groups.
Diagnosis
Symptoms of ME/CFS may appear similar to many other illnesses. There is no test to confirm ME/CFS. This makes it difficult to diagnose. The illness can also be unpredictable. Symptoms may come and go, or there may be changes in how severe symptoms are over time.
A doctor should be able to distinguish ME/CFS from other illnesses by doing a thorough medical exam. This includes asking many questions about the patient's health history and current illness. They should also ask about how often symptoms occur, how bad they are, and how long they have lasted. It is also important for doctors to talk with patients about how the symptoms affect their lives.
Treatment and recovery
There is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS. But some symptoms can be treated or managed. Treating these symptoms might provide relief for some people with ME/CFS but not others. Other strategies, like learning new ways to manage activity, can also help.
People with ME/CFS, their families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom causes the most problems. This should be treated first after discussing possible benefits and harms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies.
Healthcare providers need to support their patients' families as they come to understand how to live with this illness. Providers and families should remember that this process is likely to be hard on people with ME/CFS.

Mycetoma causes painless masses under the skin that grow larger over time.
Infections can spread and cause infections in other parts of the body including bones, sometimes leading to amputation.
People who get mycetoma often become disabled and experience stigma.

Overview
Mycetoma is a disease caused by certain types of bacteria and fungi found in soil, plant matter, and water. These bacteria and fungi may enter the body through a break in the skin, often on a person’s foot.
Mycetoma causes painless masses underneath the skin. Most cases occur in equatorial regions of Africa, Latin America, and Asia known as the “mycetoma belt."" It is more common among men than women and farmwork increases risk.
Diagnosis is made by laboratory testing of samples taken from the infected area. Mycetoma is treated with antibiotics or antifungals, depending on whether the infection is caused by bacteria or fungi. Surgery is sometimes needed to cut away the infected tissue. Wearing shoes might help prevent mycetoma.

Types
Mycetoma can be caused by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). Both types of infections look the same. Actinomycetomas progress to bone invasion more rapidly than eumycetomas. Actinomycetomas also occur more frequently on the chest, abdomen, and head compared with eumycetoma, which occurs primarily on the extremities.
Symptoms
Symptoms are similar for bacterial and fungal mycetoma. Both appear as firm, painless masses under the skin. These masses usually appear on a person’s foot but can form anywhere on the body.
Mycetoma masses start small, but over time they can grow larger and develop oozing sores. The affected limb can become deformed or unusable.
The discharge from the oozing sores can contain sand-like particles called ""grains,"" that can be white, yellow, red, brown, or black. Because lesions are usually painless and slowly progressive, time from initial infection to initiation of care varies from months to years.
If left untreated or treatment fails, it can spread to other areas of the body and even result in blood infections. Long-term mycetoma can eventually destroy the underlying muscle and bone.
Exposure risks
Mycetoma is a health problem in equatorial regions of Africa, Latin America, and Asia known as the “mycetoma belt.""
Mycetoma has been reported in dark green countries.
In the Americas, actinomycetoma is more common while both actinomycetoma and eumycetoma can be commonly diagnosed in Africa and Asia.
Risk factors
Mycetoma affects people of all ages and is more common in men. Many people with mycetoma work in agricultural jobs, such as farmers and livestock herders. People affected by mycetoma often live in remote areas where they have limited access to healthcare and medications. Mycetoma can cause severe physical disabilities that can force people to stop working and cause stigma.
How it spreads
Mycetoma is usually caused when skin is broken and exposed to soil or water containing the causative bacteria or fungi. These germs can enter the body through wounds or other small skin injuries, like a thorn prick. It is not known why only some people develop mycetoma, but aspects of the environment and living conditions are likely involved. Mycetoma does not spread between people.
Reducing risk
Healthcare providers and researchers believe that wearing shoes might prevent injuries that can lead to mycetoma. Early detection and treatment, before symptoms cause serious effects, can reduce disabilities from mycetoma and may cure the condition.
A roadmap for global mycetoma control
The Global Mycetoma Working group developed an enhanced mycetoma-control roadmap
to align with the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.
Quick facts
The number of people with mycetoma worldwide is not known. There were 19,494 cases reported in a 2020 review of scientific articles between 1876 and 2019. The actual number of cases is likely substantially higher.
Rare in the United States
Mycetoma has rarely been reported in the United States in recent decades. Data from 2017 to 2021 found 238 cases of eumycetoma. Most patients were female, over 65 years old, and lived in urban areas. There is low risk for travel-associated mycetoma.
Diagnosis
To diagnose mycetoma, healthcare providers take a small sample (biopsy) of the infected area. Biopsies are examined in laboratories.
An X-ray or ultrasound may be used to assess damage to muscle and bone. Patients can avoid long-term infection and amputation by seeking care and detecting and treating mycetoma early.
Treatment and recovery
Therapies that work against mycetoma are limited. The treatment for mycetoma depends on whether it is caused by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma).
Actinomycetoma is usually treatable with antibiotics, and surgery is usually not needed. Eumycetoma is usually treated with long-term antifungal medicine. However, this treatment may not be completely effective. Sometimes surgery or amputation are necessary to cut away the infected tissue.

About Myiasis
KEY POINTS
Myiasis is a parasitic infection of fly larva (maggots) in human tissue.
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
Myiasis typically occurs in tropical and subtropical areas.
People who have untreated or open wounds have a higher risk for getting myiasis.
Overview
Myiasis is an infection of fly larva in human tissue.
People who have untreated or open wounds have a higher risk for getting myiasis when living or traveling in tropical and subtropical areas, in the US and abroad.
You cannot get myiasis from another person. Only flies, ticks, and mosquitoes spread myiasis.
Signs and symptoms
People infected with myiasis will develop a lump in their tissue as the larva grows. Larvae under the skin may move, but usually remain under the skin and do not travel throughout the body.
Risk factors
Untreated or open wounds are risk factors that make people more likely to get infected in areas where myiasis occurs.

About New World Screwworm Myiasis
At-risk populations
Myiasis occurs in tropical and subtropical areas, including countries in Central America, South America, Africa, and the Caribbean Islands.
Myiasis is not common in the US. Most people diagnosed with myiasis in the US were infected when traveling to tropical areas where myiasis most often occurs.
Causes
A person can get myiasis when flies transfer larvae, which can happen the following ways:
Some flies drop their eggs on or near a person's wound, sore, nose, or ears, transferring the larvae to the person's skin. Certain species' larvae will move deeper in the body and can cause severe damage.
Some flies attach their eggs to mosquitoes, other flies, or ticks. Once those insects bite, the larvae transfer to a person.
One type of fly in Africa lays its eggs on the ground or on damp cloth, such as on clothing or bed linens hanging out to dry. The larvae then hatch from the eggs, and people can get infected by touching the ground or clothes that have the fly larvae on them.
Prevention
Prevention is key to protecting yourself from myiasis. Take steps to protect yourself when visiting tropical areas and spending a lot of time outside. Take precautions against insect bites:
Wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants to limit areas where you could get bitten.
Cover open wounds.
Use EPA-registered insect repellant.
Treat clothing and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin.
Follow Travelers' Health guidelines.
Diagnosis
If you think you have myiasis, see a healthcare provider who can properly diagnose and treat you.
Treatment and recovery
If you have myiasis, a healthcare provider will remove the larvae through surgery. You should clean the wound daily since that is important for healing.
