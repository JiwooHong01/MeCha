About Leishmaniasis
KEY POINTS
Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with Leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies.
A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism.
Although different forms of leishmaniasis affect people in different ways, the most common type causes skin sores.
See your healthcare provider if you think you have leishmaniasis.

Overview
Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by an infection with Leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies. Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD).
Forms
There are several different forms of leishmaniasis in people:
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL): the most common form, which causes skin sores.
Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML): a severe type of CL that can cause sores in the nose, mouth, or throat. ML can be life threatening.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL): this is a less common form, especially in the United States, which affects internal organs. If not treated, severe cases of VL can be deadly.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms can vary based on the form of leishmaniasis. People may or may not experience signs and symptoms.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)
Those who develop symptoms have one or more skin sores, which can change in size and appearance over time. The skin sores usually develop within a few weeks or months of the sand fly bite. The sores are often painless.
Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML)
ML is a form of leishmaniasis that affects the mucous membranes (most commonly the nose, but also the mouth and throat). ML can be a consequence of infection with some of the types of parasites that cause CL in parts of Central and South America and, rarely, other places.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL)
VL is another form of leishmaniasis caused by a small number of Leishmania species. People with VL may develop fever, generalized illness, and anemia (low red blood cells). VL often goes on to affect internal organs (especially the spleen, liver, and bone marrow) and can be life threatening. People with VL usually become sick within months (though it can be years) of the sand fly bite. If untreated, VL is typically deadly.
Who is at risk
Anyone who lives in or travels to an area where Leishmania parasites occur and is bitten by an infected sand fly is at risk for leishmaniasis. It is usually more common in rural areas but can also occur in the outskirts of some cities. Dusk to dawn is the time when people are most likely to be bitten.
Leishmaniasis occurs in parts of approximately 90 countries, usually in tropical or subtropical climates.
Leishmaniasis in the United States
Most cases of leishmaniasis that are diagnosed in the US are in people who were infected while traveling or living in other countries.
Occasionally, people have had locally acquired CL, especially in Texas and rarely other states (e.g., Oklahoma and Arizona). There have been no known cases of acquired VL in the US.
How it spreads
The main way people get infected with leishmaniasis is through the bite of an infected female sand fly. People may not notice the bites because sand flies are silent, very small, and the bites can be painless for many people. On average, sand flies that transmit the parasite are only about one fourth the size of mosquitoes (sometimes even smaller).
Sand flies are usually most active at twilight, evening, and nighttime hours (dusk to dawn).
Some species of Leishmania parasites can also be spread via contaminated needles (needle sharing) or blood transfusions. There have also been reports of congenital transmission (mother passing an infection to her baby during pregnancy or at birth).
Prevention
There are no vaccines or drugs to prevent leishmaniasis. The best way to prevent infection is to protect yourself from sand fly bites through preventive measures.
Even if you already had leishmaniasis, it is possible to get it again. Therefore, it is important to follow preventive measures.
Diagnosis
If you have traveled or lived in a part of the world where leishmaniasis occurs and have symptoms, talk to your healthcare provider.
CDC staff can advise your healthcare provider and help with laboratory testing for leishmaniasis. Your healthcare provider will test tissue samples from skin sores (for CL) or from bone marrow (for VL) to examine for diagnosis. Blood tests can be helpful for VL.
Treatment and recovery
CDC staff can advise your healthcare provider on whether your case of leishmaniasis should be treated, and if so, with what type of treatment.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)
Different types of treatment are available for CL and the choice of treatment depends on multiple factors, including the species of Leishmania parasite involved. In some cases, skin sores from CL might heal on their own without treatment depending on the species involved. Leishmania skin sores can take months to years to heal and the sores can leave significant scars.
Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML)
For the Leishmania species that cause ML, it is important to have proper treatment in order to prevent mucosal tissue destruction in the nose, mouth, or throat. Without treatment, ML can be life threatening if it affects the throat.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL)
It is important to recognize and treat VL early. If not treated, severe (advanced) cases of VL are typically deadly. In people with compromised immune systems (e.g., HIV, malnutrition), VL can be difficult to treat.

About Kawasaki Disease
KEY POINTS
Kawasaki disease (KD) can cause heart and blood vessel damage.
It occurs mostly in children younger than 5 years old.
It affects boys more often than girls.
KD symptoms include fever that lasts at least 5 days plus at least 1 other common disease symptom.
Most children recover with treatment.
Speak with a healthcare provider if your child has symptoms of KD.
MORE INFORMATION

Health Care Providers
Overview
Kawasaki disease (KD), also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is a disease that can cause damage to the heart and blood vessels, mostly in children younger than 5 years old. It affects boys more often than girls. The cause of KD is not known.
In the continental United States, it's estimated that KD occurs in 9 to 20 per 100,000 children under 5 years of age.
In 2019, there were more than 5,000 children under 18 years of age who were hospitalized with KD in the United States. Of these children, 3,693 were under 5 years of age; this means there was a hospitalization rate of 18.9 per 100,000 children in that age group.
Signs and symptoms
View LargerDownload
Children may have all or just some of the signs and symptoms of Kawasaki Disease.
Children with KD have a fever that typically lasts for 5 days or longer. They may also have some or all of the following symptoms:
Rash
Swelling and redness of their hands and feet
Irritation and redness of the whites of their eyes
Swollen lymph glands in their neck
Irritation and inflammation of their mouth, lips, and throat
KD can cause serious complications, including swelling of parts of the heart and other blood vessels. When this happens, the heart doesn't work as well to pump blood to the body and could burst (coronary artery dilation and aneurysms).
Surveillance and reporting for healthcare professionals
For epidemiologic surveillance, CDC defines a case of KD as illness in a patient with fever that lasts 5 or more days (or fever until the intravenous immunoglobulin is given, if given before the fifth day of fever), and having at least 4 of the following 5 clinical signs:
Rash
Swelling and redness of their hands and feet
Cervical lymphadenopathy (at least 15 cm in diameter)
Bilateral conjunctival injection
Oral mucosal changes
Patients whose illness does not meet the above KD case definition but have fever and coronary artery abnormalities are classified as having atypical or incomplete KD.
The CDC standardized KD case report form is available as a PDF document for healthcare workers to submit a report. If you are a healthcare professional and wish to submit a report, you can either print the form and fill it out by hand or fill it out electronically and print it out. The completed form should be sent to the mailing address provided on the form or sent by fax to 404-471-8768.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment for KD is available, and it must be given at the hospital. It typically combines a mixture of antibodies given through your veins (intravenous immunoglobulin) and aspirin. The treatment can help make symptoms less severe and reduce the risk of serious complications. Healthcare professionals may recommend additional treatments.
Most children recover with proper treatment.
Similar conditions
There are reports of illnesses that look like Kawasaki disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). This is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

About Acanthamoeba Infections
KEY POINTS
Acanthamoeba is a free-living ameba, a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water, soil, and dust.
Most people will come into contact with Acanthamoeba at some point, but most won't get sick. Although rare, some people develop serious Acanthamoeba infections that are often fatal.
See a healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of an Acanthamoeba infection.
Overview
Most people will be exposed to Acanthamoeba during their lifetime. The ameba is found in soil and dust as well fresh water and saltwater. It can also be found in swimming pools, hot tubs, drinking water systems, humidifiers, and in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
Most people exposed to Acanthamoeba won't get sick. For others, it can cause serious infections of the brain, skin, eyes, and sinuses. Acanthamoeba can infect parts of the body through cuts or skin wounds or from being inhaled into the lungs or nostrils. It can get into the eyes through contact lens use.
Types
Non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections
High resolution of Acanthamoeba in a patient's brain
Non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections are rare but serious infections that can affect one or many parts of the body. These infections usually occur in people with weakened immune systems and include:
Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), which affects the brain and is almost always fatal
Cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, a skin infection
Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis, an infection of the nasal cavity and sinuses
Disseminated infection, which affects multiple parts of the body. GAE, cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, and Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis can all spread to cause disseminated infections.

Fungal Eye Infections Basics
KEY POINTS
Fungal eye infections are extremely rare but can be very serious.
Most fungal eye infections occur from eye injuries.
Eye surgeries and bloodstream infections can also cause fungal eye infections.
Fungal eye infections are treated with prescription antifungal medications.
Overview
Medical illustration of Fusarium, a fungus that causes eye infections.
Eye infections can be caused by many different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, amoeba, and fungi. Eye infections caused by fungi are extremely rare but can be very serious.
Types
There are two main types of fungal eye infections, depending on the part of the eye that is infected. Many types of fungi can cause eye infections.
Types of infections
The two types of fungal eye infections are keratitis and endophthalmitis. Keratitis is an infection of the clear, front layer of the eye (the cornea). Endophthalmitis is an infection of the inside of the eye (the vitreous and/or aqueous humor).
Endophthalmitis can occur two different ways. Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs after fungal spores enter the eye from an external source. Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs when a bloodstream infection (for example, candidemia) spreads to one or both eyes.
Many types of fungi can cause infections.
Fusarium –lives in the environment, especially in soil and on plants.
Aspergillus – common mold foundi n indoor and outdoor environments.
Candida – a type of yeast that normally lives in and on the body.
Symptoms
The symptoms of a fungal eye infection can show up anytime from several days to several weeks after an exposure. Fungal eye infection symptoms are similar to those of other types of eye infections, like those caused by bacteria.
Symptoms can include:
Eye pain
Eye redness
Blurred vision
Sensitivity to light
Excessive tearing
Eye discharge
Causes
A fungal eye infection can be caused by:
Eye injury, especially with plant material (i.e., thorns or sticks).
Eye surgery or invasive eye procedures.
Contaminated medical products are a potential risk factor.
Chronic eye disease involving the surface of the eye.
Wearing contact lenses.
Fungal bloodstream infection (like candidemia).
Risk factors:
People who have diabetes, a weakened immune system, or use corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory steroids) have a higher risk of fungal eye infections. Fungal keratitis may be more common among people living in rural areas.
Eye infections can occur after eye surgery.
Prevention
Wearing eye protection when outside can help prevent fungal eye infections caused by eye injuries that involve plant material. For many activities, wearing sunglasses can offer some protection. Outdoor workers and farmworkers should wear appropriate protective eyewear.
People who wear contact lenses should care for their lenses properly. Learn more about how to protect your eyes while wearing contacts.
If you think you have an eye infection it is important to see a healthcare provider or eye doctor right away.
Diagnosis
An eye doctor can examine your eye and test for infection.
The most common way to diagnose a fungal eye infection is done by a doctor collecting a sample of tissue or fluid from the eye. The sample is sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope or cultured.
Polymerase chain reaction and confocal microscopy, a type of optical imaging, are also being used as newer, faster forms of diagnosis.
Treatment and recovery
The treatment for a fungal eye infection depends on the type of fungus, the severity of the infection, and the parts of the eye that are affected. Possible forms of treatment for fungal eye infections include:
Antifungal eye drops.
Antifungal medication given as a pill.
Antifungal medication injected.
Eye surgery may be needed if infections do not get better after using antifungal medications.

What are the kidneys?
The body has two kidneys, one on each side of the body, located behind the liver and stomach. The kidneys make urine, which is how the body washes liquid waste out of the body. The kidneys also play a role in controlling blood pressure and stimulating the bone marrow to make red blood cells.
What is the renal pelvis?
The renal pelvis is in the center of the kidney and is responsible for collecting the urine and feeding it into the ureters, two tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder. The bladder holds urine until it leaves the body.
Symptoms
A person with kidney or renal pelvis cancer may or may not have one or more of the symptoms listed here. The same symptoms can also come from other causes. If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor.
Blood in the urine.
A lump or swelling in the kidney area or abdomen.
Lower back pain or pain in the side that doesn't go away.
Feeling tired often.
Fever that keeps coming back.
Not feeling like eating.
Losing weight for no reason that you know of.
Something blocking your bowels.
A general feeling of poor health.
Risk factors
Risk factors for kidney and renal pelvis cancers include:
Being overweight or having obesity.
Smoking.
Having high blood pressure. It is not known whether the increased risk is due to high blood pressure itself or the medicines used to treat it.
Taking certain pain medicines for a long time.
Having certain genetic conditions.
Having a long-lasting infection with hepatitis C.
Having kidney stones.
Having sickle cell trait, which is associated with a very rare form of kidney cancer (renal medullary carcinoma).
Being exposed to a chemical called trichloroethylene, which is used to remove grease from metal.
Reducing risk
To lower your risk of kidney and renal pelvis cancers:
Keep a healthy weight.
Eat a healthy diet.
Be physically active.
Don't smoke, or quit if you do.
Be very careful if you use certain kinds of chemicals, especially trichloroethylene. This chemical is used by workers in some jobs, like those that work with metals.

About Klebsiella
KEY POINTS
Klebsiella is a type of bacteria normally found in human stool (feces) that can cause healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).
Klebsiella can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis.
Some Klebsiella bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics.
Overview
Klebsiella is a type of gram-negative bacteria normally found in human stool (feces) that can cause HAIs. Klebsiella are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including carbapenems (often the last line of defense against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections).
Signs and symptoms
Klebsiella can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis.
Who is at risk
In healthcare settings, Klebsiella infections commonly occur among sick patients receiving treatment for other conditions. Patients with devices like ventilators (breathing machines) or intravenous (vein) catheters, and patients taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for Klebsiella infections.

Healthy people usually do not get Klebsiella infections.
How it spreads
Person-to-person contact (most commonly).
Contact with contaminated water or soil.
Contact with contaminated equipment (e.g., ventilators (breathing machines) or intravenous (vein) catheters).
Wounds caused by injury or surgery.
Klebsiella does not spread through the air.
Prevention
Patients should clean their hands often, including:
Before preparing or eating food.
Before touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
Before and after changing wound dressings or bandages.
After using the restroom.
After blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching hospital surfaces such as bed rails, bedside tables, doorknobs, remote controls or the phone.
Healthcare staff should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Testing and diagnosis
To determine if someone has a Klebsiella infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory. Testing can also determine what treatment will work best.
Treatment and recovery
Klebsiella infections are generally treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, some Klebsiella bacteria (germs) are resistant to multiple antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.
What CDC is doing
Tracking Klebsiella infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network, and resistance testing for some species through the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network.
Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal
Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by Klebsiella and slow the spread of resistant germs.

VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
MARCH 8, 2024
About Kyasanur Forest Disease
KEY POINTS
Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a viral disease mostly found in southern India.
Spread to people primarily occurs through tick bites or contact with infected animals.
KFD can be fatal.
There is a vaccine available for people at risk for KFD.
Between 400 and 500 people get KFD every year.
What it is
Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a serious disease first identified in the Kyasanur Forest of India. It is caused by the KFD virus. Hard ticks (Hemaphysalis spinigera) spread the KFD virus to people and to animals, like monkeys and rodents.
View Larger
KFD is found in the Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala states of India.
Signs and symptoms
Most people with KFD have a sudden onset of chills, fever, and headache. Severe muscle pain, vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding can follow 3 or 4 days after symptoms begin.
Most patients recover one to two weeks after symptoms begin. About 10 to 20% of patients experience a second wave of symptoms, including severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision problems.
How long it takes for signs to show
People with KFD usually start having symptoms 3-8 days after being infected with the virus.
Risk factors
Hunters, herders, forest workers, and farmers in the Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala states of India are at higher risk for getting KFD. This is because they are more likely to be bitten by infected ticks.
Travelers visiting a location with known or history of KFD spread are at risk of infection.
People are more likely to get KFD during the dry season of November to June.
How it spreads
People get KFD from infected tick bites or exposure to an infected animal.
Infected ticks can live on livestock, but livestock rarely spread KFD to people.
KFD does not spread between people.
View LargerDownload
The KSD virus spreads from ticks to animals and people
Prevention
To prevent KFD:
Use insect repellent containing DEET to prevent tick bites.
Get vaccinated if you live in an area where KFD is found.
Avoid contact with dead or sick animals, particularly monkeys.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Tick Bites
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers diagnose KFD with the following tests:
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Virus isolation
Detection of antibodies in the blood
Treatment and recovery
There is no cure for KFD.
Supportive care is crucial, including fluid balance, providing oxygen, managing blood pressure, and treating additional infections.
With quick medical care, many patients recover from KFD without complications. However, about 3 to 5% of people with the disease will die.
Vaccines
A vaccine for KFD is available and recommended in the parts of India where KFD is found.
What CDC is doing
CDC is monitoring the spread of KFD. CDC also provides guidance on prevention and management of KFD to international public health partners.
