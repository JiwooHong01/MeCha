Yellow Fever Vaccine
KEY POINTS
Vaccine is recommended for people aged 9 months or older who are traveling to or living in areas at risk for yellow fever virus in Africa and South America.
Typically, one dose of the vaccine is safe and provides life-long protection against yellow fever.
Some people may have an increased risk of developing a reaction to the vaccine.
Talk to your healthcare provider to know if you should receive yellow fever vaccine before you travel.
Yellow fever vaccine recommendations
Yellow fever vaccine is recommended for people who are 9 months old or older and who are traveling to or living in areas at risk for yellow fever virus in Africa and South America.
The vaccine is a live, weakened form of the virus. For most people, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine provides long-lasting protection, and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. However, travelers going to areas with ongoing outbreaks may consider getting a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine if it has been 10 years or more since they were last vaccinated. Certain countries might require you to get the vaccine; visit Travelers' Health for information on specific country requirements.
Talk to your healthcare provider to determine if you need a yellow fever vaccination or a booster shot before your trip to an area at risk for yellow fever.
Reactions to yellow fever vaccine
Reactions to yellow fever vaccine are generally mild and include headaches, muscle aches, and low-grade fevers. Rarely, people develop severe, sometimes life-threatening reactions to the yellow fever vaccine, including:
Allergic reaction with difficulty breathing or swallowing (anaphylaxis)
Swelling of the brain, spinal cord, or the surrounding tissues (encephalitis or meningitis)
Guillain-Barré syndrome, a nervous system disorder in which a person's own immune system damages the nerve cells causing muscle weakness, and sometimes, paralysis.
Internal organ dysfunction or failure
If you recently received the yellow fever vaccination and develop fever, headache, tiredness, body aches, vomiting, or diarrhea, see your healthcare provider.
Am I at greater risk of a vaccine reaction?
Some people might have an increased risk of developing a reaction to the vaccine (precaution) but may still benefit from being vaccinated. A few people should not get the vaccine because they have a greater risk of developing a severe reaction to the vaccine (contraindication). Tell your healthcare provider if you have one of the following precautions or contraindications to vaccination.
Precautions
Between 6 and 8 months old
Over 60 years old
Pregnant
Breastfeeding
Keep Reading:
Yellow Fever Vaccine and Pregnancy
Contraindications
Allergic to the vaccine or something in the vaccine (like eggs)
Aged 6 months or younger
Organ transplant recipients
Diagnosed with a malignant tumor
Diagnosed with thymus disorder associated with abnormal immune function
Diagnosed with a primary immunodeficiency
Using immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies
Showing symptoms of HIV infection or CD4+ T-lymphocytes less than 200/mm3 (less than 15% of total lymphocytes in children aged 6 years or younger)

About Yellow Fever
KEY POINTS
Yellow fever virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of infected mosquitoes.
Illness ranges from a fever with aches to severe liver disease with bleeding and yellowing skin and eyes.
A vaccine is available for at risk travelers.
You can also reduce your risk by avoiding mosquito bites.
Overview
Yellow fever virus is spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito. It is found in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa and South America. Yellow fever is a very rare cause of illness in U.S. travelers.
Illness ranges from a fever with aches and pains to severe liver disease with bleeding and yellowing skin and eyes (jaundice). Yellow fever is diagnosed based on laboratory testing, a person’s symptoms, and travel history.
There is no medicine to treat yellow fever. To prevent getting sick from yellow fever, protect yourself from mosquito bites and get vaccinated, if vaccination is recommended for you.

About Yersinia Infection
KEY POINTS
Yersinia are bacteria (germs) that can make you sick.
Infection with Yersinia is often linked to eating raw or undercooked pork.
Symptoms depend on the age of the person with the infection.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Yersinia are bacteria (germs) that can make people ill.
Two kinds of Yersinia can cause diarrhea. They are:
Yersinia enterocolitica
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis
The illness these kinds of Yersinia can cause is called yersiniosis.
Reminder
This site focuses on yersiniosis and the kinds of Yersinia that cause it. To learn about Yersinia pestis and the disease it causes, visit CDC's plague website.
Causes
People can get infected after swallowing Yersinia. Children are more likely to get Yersinia infection than adults.
Common causes of infection
Contaminated food, especially raw or undercooked pork
Contact with a person who has prepared a pork product, such as chitlins
Keep in mind
Germs can spread from hands to infants and toddlers. If you've been preparing food, be sure to wash your hands well before touching a child or a child's bottles, pacifiers, or toys.
Handwashing tips
Less common causes of infection
Drinking contaminated milk or untreated water
Contact with animals, their environments, or their poop
Contact with another person (for example, by not washing hands thoroughly after changing the diaper of a child with an infection)
Symptoms
Symptoms depend on the age of the person with Yersinia infection.
Symptoms in young children
Fever
Pain in the abdomen (belly area)
Diarrhea that can be bloody
Symptoms in older children and adults
Fever
Pain on the right side of the abdomen
Sore throat also can occur, particularly in children.
Note: The pain might be confused with an inflamed or infected appendix (appendicitis).
Diagnosis
Infection is diagnosed by a laboratory test.
Treatment
Fluids
People with diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Dehydration is not having enough water in the body.
Dehydration can happen quickly in young children. Give children with diarrhea or vomiting extra fluids, such as Pedialyte, or oral rehydration salts. Do not wait.
Anti-diarrheal medication
Talk to your healthcare provider before taking anti-diarrheal medication, such as Imodium®.*

About Plague
KEY POINTS
Plague is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis.
Plague occurs naturally in areas of the western United States, where it circulates among wild rodents and other animals.
Plague can be cured with antibiotics, but treatment must be given quickly.
Overview
Plague is a disease that affects humans and other mammals. It is caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis. Humans usually become infected through the bite of an infected rodent flea or by handling an infected animal. Plague can be cured with antibiotics, but these must be given promptly to prevent serious illness or death. Plague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Nowadays, it is a rare but persistent cause of illness in rural areas in the western United States and certain regions of Africa and Asia.

About Young Worker Safety and Health
KEY POINTS
Employers are responsible for providing young workers with a safe and healthy workplace.
Young workers may have little or no prior work experience. They also have high rates of job-related injuries.
Young workers can practice basic safety skills to protect themselves on the job.
Why it's important
In 2022, there were about 19.4 million workers under the age of 25 (12.2% of the total workforce).1
Young worker employment, injuries, illnesses
These charts include available data and trend data for multiple years.
Charts
Young workers have high rates of job-related injuries. These injuries are often the result of the hazards in the places they work, such as retail spaces or restaurants. Little or no prior work experience and a lack of safety training also contribute to injuries.
Employers must provide a workplace free of known hazards that can cause illness, injury, or death.2
Reminder
Young workers have a right to a safe work environment and can contribute
to keeping the workplace safe.
Employer responsibilities
Employers are responsible for the following actions:
Follow the rules, regulations, and codes of the Occupational Safety and Health Act
. Understand and comply with all relevant federal and state child labor laws.
Inform young workers of potential or known workplace hazards through training and other means (policies, programs, and safety practices).
Train workers in a language and with wording they understand so that they can follow safety rules.
Ensure that equipment operated by young workers is both legal and safe to use. Label equipment that young workers are not allowed to operate.
Ensure young workers know what to do if they get hurt on the job.
Display the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) poster
(or state plan equivalent) listing everyone's rights and responsibilities.
Do not single out workers who exercise their rights under the Act (see OSHA's Whistleblower Protections
).
Young drivers at work
Employers and parents/guardians can play an important role in keeping young drivers safe on the road.
Young drivers at work
Employers can remind young workers to:
Use work-supplied safety equipment and safety training.
Follow procedures designed for workplace safety and inform a supervisor if there is something unsafe at work.
Ask a supervisor to follow up with a safety person if there are concerns about a job task being unsafe.
Young workers have the right to refuse to do a job or task that is unsafe. Remind them to speak with a supervisor about all safety concerns.
Reminder
You can replace a job but not a lost limb or injured back.
8 things young workers should know about working safely
While employers are responsible for providing workers with a safe and healthy workplace, young workers should have a few basic skills to help protect themselves.
Talking Safety curriculum
Research shows that more needs to be done to ensure that as young people join the workforce they are better protected from hazards. This free, engaging curriculum is intended for use in classrooms and other group settings.
View curriculum
Young workers should be able to do these 8 things:
Recognize that although work is valuable, any worker can be injured, become sick, or even be killed on the job. Understand how workplace injuries can affect your life and your family.
Recognize that most work-related injuries and illnesses are predictable and can be prevented.
Identify hazards at work, evaluate the risks, and predict how workers can become hurt or sick.
Describe the best ways to handle hazards on the job and apply these to problems at your workplace.
Spot emergencies at work and know the best ways to handle them.
Recognize employer and worker rights and responsibilities that play a role in safe and healthy work.
Find resources that help keep workers safe and healthy on the job.
Show how workers can communicate with others—including people in charge—to ask questions or report problems or concerns when they feel unsafe or threatened.
Training for young workers
Safety Matters is interactive teaching module a targeted to students in grades 7-12. Safety professionals can use Safety Matters to equip young people with the skills and knowledge they need to participate in safe and healthy work environments throughout their working lives.

About Youth Violence
KEY POINTS
Youth violence is a serious public health problem.
Youth violence can have long-term impacts on health, opportunity, and well-being.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
What is youth violence?
Youth violence is the intentional use of physical force or power to threaten or harm others by young people ages 10-24.
It can include things like fighting, bullying, threats with weapons, and gang-related violence. A young person can be involved with youth violence as a victim, offender, or witness.
Quick facts and stats
Thousands of people experience youth violence every day. Youth violence negatively impacts youth in all communities—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal. The following facts are based on data from the United States.
Youth violence is common. Homicide is the third leading cause of death for young people ages 10-24. It is the leading cause of death for non-Hispanic Black or African American youth.12 Emergency departments treat over 800 young people for physical assault-related injuries each day.1
Some youth are at greater risk than others. Sexual minority teens are more likely to experience multiple forms of violence compared to their heterosexual peers.1 Black or African American youth and young adults are at higher risk for the most physically harmful forms of violence. This includes homicides, fights with injuries, and aggravated assaults.2
Youth violence is costly. In 2020, youth homicides and nonfatal physical assault-related injuries resulted in an estimated $122 billion annually. These costs include medical care, lost work, and quality of life. This estimate does not include costs to the criminal justice system.3
COVID-19 has impacted the economic burden of youth violence. Compared to 2019, the economic burden of youth violence was 17% higher in 2020 ($122 billion vs. $105 billion).3
Outcomes
Youth violence can have serious and lasting effects on young people’s physical, mental, and social health. It can harm development and contribute to impaired decision-making and learning challenges. It can also contribute to decreased connections to peers and adults, and trouble coping with stress.1
Youth violence is linked to negative health and well-being outcomes and disproportionately impacts communities of color.1 Violence increases the risk for behavioral and mental health difficulties. These can include future violence perpetration and victimization. Other outcomes include smoking, substance use, obesity, high-risk sexual behavior, depression, academic difficulties, school dropout, and suicide.1
Violence increases health care costs, decreases property value, negatively impacts school attendance, and decreases access to community support services. Addressing the short- and long-term consequences of violence strains community resources. As a result, this limits the resources that states and communities can use to address other needs.
Prevention
We can protect youth and support their growth into healthy adults. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of youth experiencing or perpetrating violence.
Preventing youth violence requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence.
Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of violence. It is important for prevention efforts to consider societal conditions disproportionately experienced by Black or African American youth and young adults. This includes conditions like concentrated poverty and residential segregation. It also includes other forms of racism that limit opportunities to grow up in healthy, violence-free environments. Addressing the root causes of violence is critical to reducing high rates of violence in communities of color.2
