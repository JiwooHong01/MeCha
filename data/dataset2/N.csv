About Naegleria fowleri Infections
KEY POINTS
Naegleria fowleri is a free-living ameba, a kind of one-celled organism that thrives in warm freshwater lakes, rivers, and hot springs.
It is often called the ""brain-eating ameba"" because it can infect the brain and destroy brain tissue.
Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri are very rare but nearly always fatal.

Public Health
Overview
Naegleria fowleri lives in soil and warm freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs around the world.
In very rare cases, Naegleria fowleri has been found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. The ameba also has been found in tap water.
If water containing the ameba goes up the nose and to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone who gets PAM dies from it.
Between 1962 and 2023, there were 164 reported cases of PAM in the United States. Only four have survived.

Signs and symptoms
Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days.
As PAM progresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations.

Symptoms of Naegleria fowleri Infection
Exposure risks
Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri usually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh water during summer months. Infections often happen when it's been hot for long periods, resulting in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.
A few infections have occurred when people used tap water that contained Naegleria fowleri to rinse their sinuses or cleanse their nasal passages.
In very rare instances, people have become infected from recreational water like splash pads and a surf park that did not have enough chlorine.
You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing water containing the ameba. You also can't get an infection from someone else or pass it on to others.
Keep Reading:
What Causes Naegleria fowleri Infection
Reducing risk
To help protect yourself against a Naegleria fowleri infection:
Hold your nose or wear a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into fresh water.
Always keep your head above water in hot springs.
Don't dig in shallow water because the ameba is more likely to live there.
Use distilled or boiled tap water when rinsing your sinuses or cleansing your nasal passages.

How to Prevent Naegleria fowleri Infection When Rinsing Sinuses or Nasal Passages
Diagnosis
A Naegleria fowleri infection is diagnosed using laboratory tests. These tests are available in only a few labs in the United States, including CDC.
Because these infections are so rare and hard to detect, diagnosis sometimes happens after a person has died.
Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of PAM.
Treatment and recovery
Naegleria fowleri can destroy brain tissue and cause the brain to swell. Unfortunately, more than 97% of people with PAM have died from the infection.
PAM progresses very quickly. This has made treatments for the disease difficult to identify. There is some evidence that certain drugs may be effective.

Clinical Care of Naegleria fowleri Infection
What CDC is doing
CDC's Free-Living and Intestinal Amebas Lab is one of only a few labs in the country that can identify Naegleria fowleri. It is experienced in diagnosing Naegleria fowleri infections and can provide results quickly.

Free-living amebas
A free-living ameba is a kind of one-celled organism that lives in water and soil around the world. Most people will come into contact with these amebas during their lives but won't get sick. Others will develop rare but serious infections.
Although there are several types of free-living amebas that live in the environment, three are known to cause severe disease in people:
Acanthamoeba
Balamuthia mandrillaris
Naegleria fowleri
All of these amebas can cause life-threatening brain infections. Some can also cause infections of the eyes, skin, sinuses, and other parts of the body.

Nail Gun Safety
KEY POINTS
Nail guns are a leading cause of injury among residential carpenters.
Employers and workers can take steps to prevent nail gun injuries.
Seek medical attention immediately after a nail gun injury.
The dangers
Nail guns are commonly used in wood frame construction. They are powerful, easy to operate and boost productivity for nailing tasks.
Nail guns are a leading cause of injury among residential carpenters. They are responsible for about 37,000 emergency room visits each year, of which 60% are work-related. Puncture wounds to the hands and fingers are most common, but more serious injuries and deaths occur using nail guns.
All nail guns have the potential to cause serious injury. Using a nail gun with a bump or automatic trigger (also known as contact trip trigger) can cause unintended nail discharge. Other risks include lack of training, working fast, and keeping the trigger squeezed when not nailing. Using a nail gun with a single shot or full sequential trigger reduces the risk of injury.
Instructions and tips
Workers can talk to their employer about nail gun safety and prevention. Employers can take several steps to prevent nail gun injuries. To learn more, refer to Nail Gun Safety: A Guide for Construction Contractors.
Use full sequential trigger nail guns.
Provide training.
Establish nail gun work procedures.
Provide personal protective equipment (PPE).
Encourage reporting and discussion of injuries and close calls.
Employers and workers should also seek medical attention immediately after nail gun injuries. This includes hand injuries that appear to be minimal.

Nail Technicians: Workplace Safety and Health
AT A GLANCE
Nail technicians can be exposed to chemical and physical hazards at work.
Overexposure to certain chemicals can cause different types of health effects, including respiratory, neurological, reproductive, and more.
Nail technicians are also at risk for musculoskeletal problems from awkward postures and repetitive motions.
There are ways employers and workers can reduce nail technicians' health risks.
Overview
Nail salon workers, or nail technicians, perform work tasks that can put them at risk for negative health outcomes. Nail technicians are potentially exposed to dozens of chemicals at work. Repetitive motions and awkward positions can also strain their muscles, joints, and ligaments.
In the United States, there are over 400,000 active nail technicians.1 These workers are largely:
Female12
Foreign-born/minority workers12
Approximately 46% of nail technicians born outside of the United States do not speak English well.2
Hazards and exposures
Chemical hazards
Nail products often contain many chemical ingredients. Some common chemicals in these products include:
Acetone
Dibutyl phthalate
Ethyl acetate
Formaldehyde
Methacrylate compounds
Toluene
Triphenyl phosphate
Workers can breathe in the dusts or vapors from these chemicals, absorb them through the skin, or ingest them. Depending on the exposure, some chemicals in nail salon products can cause health problems like:
Skin rash or contact dermatitis
Eye, nose, throat irritation
Asthma
Neurological effects
Reproductive problems
Cancer
Physical hazards
Nail technicians might use awkward postures during work tasks. For example, they might lean over a table during manicures or hunch down to perform pedicures. They also perform repetitive motions, such as filing nails. Awkward postures and repetitive motions put them at risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders.
Best practices
Reducing chemical exposures
Ventilation
Good ventilation can reduce the level of chemicals in the air. In addition to general room ventilation, nail salons can use local exhaust ventilation controls at workstations.3
Local exhaust ventilation can come in many forms, such as:
Portable units that filter or exhaust air to the outdoors
Downdraft ventilated tables
Other ways to reduce workers' exposure to chemicals
Use pressure-sensitive dispenser bottles with small openings 3
Keep chemical containers closed3
Avoid eating or drinking in the work area3
Wear personal protective equipment, such as gloves3 and N95® filtering facepiece respirator4
Ventilation and gloves can help reduce chemical exposures.
Reducing musculoskeletal strain
Using equipment that improves posture, such as an adjustable chair, and taking breaks can help reduce the risk for musculoskeletal issues. See more best practices for nail technicians on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) website
. Employers can use the NIOSH Elements of Ergonomics Programs to help reduce workers' musculoskeletal disorders.
Spotlight
A recent NIOSH Science blog discusses NIOSH work on researching the risk of birth defects among pregnant nail salon workers and hairdressers. NIOSH researchers found mothers who gave birth to infants with a congenital heart defect were roughly 3 times more likely than mothers of infants with no birth defect to have worked as a nail technician during early pregnancy.
The blog is also available in Vietnamese and Korean.

VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
MARCH 5, 2024
About Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever
KEY POINTS
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a rare, serious viral disease spread to humans by tick bites or infected animal blood.
CCHF is the most widespread viral hemorrhagic fever, found in Eastern and Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, northwestern China, central Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.
Healthcare workers and people in close contact with livestock are at higher risk for CCHF.
Overview
CCHF is caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which is spread by ticks. The CCHF virus can cause sudden illness. CCHF can spread between humans through contact with infectious blood or body fluids. It can result in severe bleeding and death. There's no cure for CCHF.
View Larger
The CCHF virus is present in the countries in red.
Healthcare providers:
Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like CCHF, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC
Signs and symptoms
CCHF symptoms usually appear suddenly and may include:
High fever
Severe headache
Back and joint pain
Stomach pain and vomiting
Red eyes and flushed face
Red spots on the roof of the mouth
Jaundice
Changes in mood and sensory perception
Agitation
Drowsiness
Bleeding
People with CCHF are usually sick for about two weeks. Around the fourth day of illness, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can develop.
Up to 50% of people hospitalized with CCHF will die.
How long it takes for signs to show
Symptoms can start 1-14 days after being exposed to the virus.
Risk factors
The following groups of people are at a higher risk of CHHF:
People in close contact with livestock in areas where CCHF is found
Healthcare workers caring for someone with CCHF without proper PPE
How it spreads
CCHF virus spreads through:
Tick bites from infected hard ticks (Ixodid)
Contact with blood or body fluids of infected animals or humans
Improperly sterilized medical equipment
Healthcare acquired infections are common.
Prevention
To prevent CCHF:
Use DEET-containing insect repellent to prevent tick bites.
Wear gloves, long sleeves, and pants when handling animals where CCHF is found.
Avoid contact with body fluids of potentially infected animals or people.
If CCHF is suspected and the patient is clinically stable: Healthcare providers should use PPE for clinically stable suspect VHF patients.
If CCHF is suspected and the patient is clinically unstable (for example, hemodynamic instability, vomiting) OR CCHF is confirmed regardless of clinical stability: Healthcare providers should use PPE for clinically unstable VHF patients.
Testing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers diagnose CCHF with the following tests:
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Detection of antibodies in the blood
CCHF is a notifiable condition. Healthcare providers should notify their health department if they suspect a patient has CCHF.
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific treatment or cure for CCHF.
Supportive care includes fluid balance, giving oxygen, managing blood pressure, and treating other infections.
An antiviral called Ribavirin has shown some benefits in treating CCHF patients.
Recovery is slow, and the long-term effects are not well-studied.
More research is needed to determine the efficacy of ribavirin and other antiviral drugs in treating CCHF.
Vaccines
Currently, there is no widely available or approved vaccine for human use to prevent CCHF.
One type of vaccine is used on a small scale in Eastern Europe. However, more research is needed to determine the efficacy of this vaccine in preventing CCHF.

About the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS)
AT A GLANCE
NARMS collects information about enteric bacteria from humans, retail meats, and food animals
NARMS provides data on emerging antimicrobial resistance, ways in which resistance is spread, and differences between resistant and susceptible infections.
Measuring antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from people helps us understand and prevent transmission of resistant infections.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Tracking trends in resistance
NARMS is a US public health surveillance system that tracks antimicrobial resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria.
NARMS is an interagency partnership among the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA
), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA
), and state and local health departments.
Different agencies, different sources
NARMS monitors antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria from three sources:
Humans (CDC)
Retail meats (FDA
)
Food animals (USDA
)
The NARMS program at CDC helps protect public health by providing information about emerging antimicrobial resistance, the ways in which resistance is spread, and differences between resistant and susceptible infections.
Keep Reading:
Learn more about the roles of federal and state agencies that track antimicrobial resistance in support of food safety.
What's collected
CDC NARMS conducts antimicrobial susceptibility testing on human isolatesA of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, E. coli O157, and Vibrio (other than V. cholerae).
CDC NARMS also conducts antimicrobial susceptibility testing on human isolates from multistate outbreaks caused by Salmonella, Shigella, and E. coli.
FDA NARMS conducts serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and/or genetic analysis on isolates of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Enterococcus, and E. coli from retail meat and seafood samples. These samples include chicken, ground turkey, ground beef, pork chops, shrimp, tilapia, and salmon.
USDA NARMS conducts similar tests on isolates of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Enterococcus, and E. coli from food-producing animal specimens. These specimens are collected at federally inspected slaughter and processing plants throughout the United States.
CDC's Role in NARMS
Glossary of terms related to antimicrobial resistance
How the data are used
How NARMS helps investigators
Public health officials use information collected by NARMS to
Detect emerging trends of resistance
Link enteric illnesses (resistant and susceptible) to specific sources and risk factors
Understand genetic mechanisms that confer resistance and the spread of resistance among enteric bacteria
Collaborate on investigation of outbreaks of enteric disease, including multistate foodborne outbreaks
Educate consumers about foodborne antimicrobial resistance threats and food safety practices that protect against these threats
Guide public health priorities
Provide information and recommendations that promote the judicious use of antimicrobial agents
Why information collected by NARMS is important
Antimicrobial use in both humans and animals can lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria that cause human infections.
Resistant bacteria can multiply and spread. They can also share their resistance with other kinds of bacteria to create new resistant bacterial strains.
Most enteric infections are self-limiting, but antimicrobial agents are essential to treat severe illness. If pathogens are resistant to antimicrobial agents, illness may be prolonged or more severe.
Measuring antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from people, foods, and food animals is central to understanding and preventing transmission of resistant infections.
Data provided by NARMS inform the development of public health interventions and policies designed to protect people from the threat of resistant enteric infections.

About National Electronic Disease Surveillance System Base System (NBS)
KEY POINTS
NBS is a CDC-developed information system that helps public health departments manage reportable disease data and send notifiable disease data to CDC.
NBS integrates data from many sources on multiple public health conditions to help public health officials identify and track cases of disease over.
What is NBS?
The National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) Base System (NBS) is a CDC-developed integrated information system that helps local, state, and territorial public health departments manage reportable disease data and send notifiable disease data to CDC.
NBS provides a tool to support the public health investigation workflow and to process, analyze, and share disease-related health information. NBS also provides reporting jurisdictions with a NEDSS-compatible information system to transfer epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical data efficiently and securely over the Internet.
Built and maintained by CDC, NBS integrates data from many sources on multiple public health conditions to help local, state, and territorial public health officials identify and track cases of disease over time. This capability allows public health to provide appropriate interventions to help limit the severity and spread of disease.
NBS facilitates the adoption of national consensus standards used across public health and healthcare—including vocabulary standards such as LOINC, SNOMED, and RXNORM and messaging standards such as HL7—and helps local, state, and territorial public health departments use standards when sending information to CDC about notifiable diseases and conditions.
Who Uses NBS?
Currently, 25 health departments (20 states: CNMI; Guam; Puerto Rico; RMI; and U.S. Virgin Islands) use NBS to manage public health investigations and transfer general communicable disease surveillance data to CDC.
Note: Mississippi is using NBS for COVID-19 only.

How NBS Data Guide Public Health Actions
NBS supports surveillance for any type of condition. However, it is primarily used for state reportable and nationally notifiable conditions, most of which are infectious diseases. Public health reporting jurisdictions, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and CDC work together to determine the list of conditions on an annual basis. Currently, more than 140 different diseases and conditions are tracked through NBS.
Data collected for surveillance purposes are used primarily at the local and state level to guide public health action. A subset of the data collected are sent to CDC to support surveillance at the national level. The data are used to
identify cases of illness that affect public health,
prevent additional cases of disease,
ensure that appropriate interventions such as treatment are implemented,
help make policy and funding decisions,
evaluate interventions and programs, and
monitor the incidence of disease over time.
Evolution of the System
The primary goal of the first release of NBS was to support the electronic processes involved in state reportable and notifiable disease surveillance, investigation, and analysis and replace the functionality supported by the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS). CDC started development of NBS in 2001, and the first version of the application went live in the state of Nebraska in January 2003. Since then, the system has evolved into a modern disease surveillance, case management, and case notification system. It serves as a reference implementation of the NEDSS standards and living laboratory for testing implementation of best practices in public health surveillance systems.
National Electronic Disease Surveillance System
Integrated surveillance information systems in reporting jurisdictions that are based on the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System architectural standards are primary data sources for the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Jurisdictions use these information systems to create and send standards-based case notifications to CDC for NNDSS.
NBS provides a NEDSS-compatible data system for use by local, state, and territorial public health departments. It helps public health departments with
integration of multiple diseases into one surveillance system to improve programmatic processes and reduce costs associated with supporting multiple systems;
reportable disease surveillance by improving information sharing between healthcare providers and health departments and between health departments and CDC; and
electronic laboratory reporting to improve public health disease reporting.

injectable flu vaccines, or flu shots. These include:
Flu shots that are made with inactivated influenza viruses.
One flu shot that is made without influenza viruses.
A live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is given by nasal spray.
People who can get the flu shot
Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza.
Flu vaccination has important benefits. It can reduce flu illnesses, visits to doctor's offices, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as make symptoms less severe and reduce flu-related hospitalizations and deaths in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.
Get vaccinated before flu season starts
It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body.
Recommended vaccines depend on a person's age and other characteristics
There are standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines that are approved for people as young as 6 months of age.
Some vaccines are only approved for adults. For example, the recombinant flu vaccine is approved for people 18 years and older, and the adjuvanted and high-dose inactivated vaccines are approved for people 65 years and older.
For people younger than 65 years, CDC does not recommend any one flu vaccine over another.
For adults 65 years and older, there are 3 flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended. These are Fluzone High-Dose inactivated flu vaccine, Flublok recombinant flu vaccine, and Fluad adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine. If none of the 3 flu vaccines preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older is available at the time of administration, people in this age group can get any other age-appropriate flu vaccine instead.
For many people who are 2 years through 49 years of age, the nasal spray flu vaccine is an option. The nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for people with some medical conditions. Also, if you are pregnant, you should not get the nasal spray flu vaccine.
In general, each person should get an age-appropriate flu vaccine (that is, one that is approved for their age). However, solid organ transplant recipients who are 18 through 64 years of age and who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive high-dose inactivated flu vaccine or adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine (which are currently approved for people ages 65 years and older). These vaccines are not preferred over other age-appropriate flu vaccines but are acceptable options for this population.
High-dose inactivated flu vaccine, recombinant flu vaccine, and adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine are preferred for people 65 years of age and older. There are no other preferential recommendations for specific flu vaccines for specific groups of people.

Vaccines and People with Egg Allergies
There are many vaccine options
If you are pregnant or have certain chronic health conditions, you should get a flu shot.
People with egg allergy may get any vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg.
The most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year.
When to get vaccinated against flu
For most people who need only one dose of influenza vaccine for the season, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Additional considerations concerning the timing of vaccination for certain groups of people include:
Most adults, especially those 65 years and older, and pregnant women in the first or second trimester should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time. However, early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated.
Some children need two doses of influenza vaccine. For those children, it is recommended that the first dose be given as soon as vaccine is available because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for children who need only one dose.
Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for mothers who are in the third trimester of pregnancy, because this can help protect their infants for the first few months after birth (when they are too young to be vaccinated).
<!-- Flu Finder Widget !-->
People who SHOULD NOT get a flu shot
Children younger than 6 months of age are too young to get a flu shot.
People with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine (other than egg proteins) should not get that vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.
People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine in the past, it is important to talk with your health care provider to help determine whether vaccination is appropriate for you.
People who should talk to their health care provider before getting a flu shot
Different influenza vaccines are approved for use in people in different age groups. In addition, some vaccines are not recommended for certain groups of people. Factors that can determine a person’s suitability for vaccination, or vaccination with a particular vaccine, include a person’s age, health (current and past) and any allergies to influenza vaccine or its components.
Children younger than 6 months of age are too young to get a flu shot.
People with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine (other than egg proteins) should not get that vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.
People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine in the past, it is important to talk with your health care provider to help determine whether vaccination is appropriate for you.
Prioritized for flu vaccination during a vaccine shortage
When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to the following people (no hierarchy is implied by order of listing):
Children aged 6 months through 4 years (59 months);
People aged 50 years and olderA;
People with chronic pulmonary (including asthma) or cardiovascular (except isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus);
People who are immunosuppressed due to any cause, including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection;
Mothers who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season and up to 2 weeks postpartum (after delivery);
People who are aged 6 months through 18 years who are receiving aspirin or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;
People who are residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities;
American Indian or Alaska Native persons;
People with extreme obesity (body-mass index [BMI] is 40 or greater);
Health care personnel;
Household contacts and caregivers of children under 5 years and adults 50 years and older; and
Household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at increased risk for severe illness from influenza.

AT A GLANCE
The National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) supports outbreak reporting by partners in state, local, and territorial public health agencies.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Public Health
Purpose
Through NORS, CDC collects reports of enteric disease outbreaks caused by bacterial, viral, parasitic, chemical, toxin, and unknown agents, as well as foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of non-enteric disease. NORS also collects reports of certain fungal disease outbreaks.
Tip
If you would like to report an outbreak, please contact your local or state health department.
Directory of health departments
What's collected
NORS collects data on these types of outbreaks in the United States:
Waterborne disease outbreaks – all outbreaks of respiratory, skin, enteric or other types of illness spread through water, including water that people drink, swim in, or use for other purposes
Foodborne disease outbreaks – all outbreaks spread through food
Animal contact disease outbreaks – all outbreaks of enteric illness spread to humans from contact with animals, such as a chicken or pet turtle, or their environments
Person-to-person transmitted disease outbreaks – all outbreaks of enteric illness spread directly from one person to another through direct contact, such as by handshake
Environmental contamination outbreaks – all outbreaks of enteric illness spread through contact with other environmental sources, such as dirty linens or surfaces that people touch in bathrooms, as well as outbreaks of blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, or sporotrichosis
Other enteric illness outbreaks – all outbreaks of enteric illness spread through other, unknown, or indeterminate means
Did you know?
Several CDC surveillance systems are linked to NORS, including those that collect information on waterborne, foodborne, and animal contact disease outbreaks.

How data collection works
NORS is a valuable tool for collecting outbreak data needed to improve public health
Outbreak investigations are most often initiated by state, local, and territorial public health agencies and by CDC. These agencies report outbreaks through NORS. The system collects information such as
date and location of the outbreak,
the number of people who became ill and their symptoms, and
the pathogen that caused the outbreak.
CDC checks these data for accuracy and analyzes them to identify national trends and to gather information that could prevent future outbreaks.

OCTOBER 10, 2024
About National Enteric Disease Surveillance
PURPOSE
CDC collects, analyzes, and disseminates national surveillance data on bacterial enteric illnesses in order to provide a national snapshot of the occurrence of infections transmitted commonly through food and other means. Our goal is to decrease the burden of acute bacterial enteric illnesses in the United States.
Overview
CDC collects data on nationally notifiable enteric bacterial infections. These infections include botulism (caused by toxin-producing Clostridia bacteria, including Clostridium botulinum), invasive Cronobacter infection among infants, and infections caused by Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. (including those causing typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever), Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Shigella spp., and Vibrio spp. (including those causing cholera).
Types of surveillance
National case-based surveillance
CDC conducts national case-based surveillance for botulism, cholera and other Vibrio illnesses (including V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus infections), Listeria infections, typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever, and invasive Cronobacter infections among infants.
State, tribal, local, and territorial partners submit case data for infections with nationally notifiable enteric pathogens through the System for Enteric Disease Response, Investigation, and Coordination (SEDRIC).
Case data includes information about the specific infection, such as symptoms of illness and when they started, demographic information about the ill person (e.g., age, sex, state of residence), and key risk factor information (e.g., travel, activities, foods consumed) for the specific infection.
National laboratory-based surveillance
CDC conducts national laboratory-based surveillance for infections caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and STEC.
State and territorial public health laboratories submit information about bacteria that have been identified by laboratory testing of ill persons.
Laboratory data includes limited demographic information about the ill person and specimen information (e.g., species or serotype of bacteria, specimen source, type of test used).

Soil-Transmitted Helminths

JUNE 13, 2024
About Soil-transmitted helminths
KEY POINTS
Soil-transmitted Helminths, or STH, are parasitic worms that live in the human intestine.
They spread through soil or water contaminated by human feces (poop) that contain the parasite larvae.
STH infections are considered neglected tropical diseases or NTDs.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities.
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer.
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months.
Resource
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are:
Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.
Contaminating drinking water sources.
Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.
Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil.
Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.
Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.
Hookworm
You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.
Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.
One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Blood and protein or nutrient loss
Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)
Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections
Wash your hands before handling food.
Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.
Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.
Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite.
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or ""preventive chemotherapy"".
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children.
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other ""neglected tropical diseases"" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.

Signs and symptoms
How do I know if I have gonorrhea?
Gonorrhea often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms.
Symptoms in women
Most women with gonorrhea do not have any symptoms. Even when a woman has symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. Symptoms in women can include:
Painful or burning sensation when peeing
Increased vaginal discharge
Vaginal bleeding between periods
Symptoms in men
Men who do have symptoms may have:
A burning sensation when peeing
A white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis
Painful or swollen testicles (although this is less common)
Symptoms from rectal infections
Rectal infections may either cause no symptoms or cause symptoms in both men and women that may include:
Discharge
Anal itching
Soreness
Bleeding
Painful bowel movements
See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly discharge, burning when peeing, or bleeding between periods.
Risk factors
Am I at risk for gonorrhea?
Sexually active people can get gonorrhea through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with a partner who has gonorrhea.
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for gonorrhea or other STIs.
How it spreads
How is gonorrhea spread?
You can get gonorrhea by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with someone who has the infection. A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can give the infection to her baby during childbirth.
Prevention
How can I reduce my risk of getting gonorrhea?
The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
If you are sexually active, the following things can lower your chances of getting gonorrhea:
Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have gonorrhea.
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex.
I'm pregnant. If I have gonorrhea, how can I protect my baby from getting it?
If you are pregnant and have gonorrhea, you can give the infection to your baby during delivery. This can cause serious health problems for your baby. If you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about getting the correct examination, testing, and treatment. Treating gonorrhea as soon as possible will make health problems for your baby less likely.
Testing and diagnosis
Should I be tested for gonorrhea?
If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for gonorrhea or other STIs.
If you are a sexually active gay or bisexual man, you should get tested for gonorrhea every year. If you are a sexually active woman, you should get tested for gonorrhea every year if you are:
Younger than 25 years
25 years and older with risk factors, such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection
Testing is also recommended during pregnancy in some cases.
How will my healthcare provider know if I have gonorrhea?
Most of the time, a healthcare provider will use a a urine sample to diagnose gonorrhea. However, if you have had oral and/or anal sex, your healthcare provider may use swabs to collect samples from your throat and/or rectum. In some cases, a healthcare provider may also use a swab to collect a sample from a man's urethra (urine canal) or a woman's cervix (opening to the womb).
Treatment and recovery
Is there a cure for gonorrhea?
Yes, the right treatment can cure gonorrhea. It is important that you take all of the medicine your healthcare provider gives you to cure your infection. Do not share medicine for gonorrhea with anyone. Although medicine will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease.
It is becoming harder to treat some gonorrhea, as drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea are increasing. Return to a healthcare provider if your symptoms continue for more than a few days after receiving treatment.
When can I have sex again after my gonorrhea treatment?
Wait seven days after finishing all medicine before having sex. You and your sex partner(s) should avoid having sex until you have each completed treatment and your symptoms are gone. This will help prevent you and your partner(s) from giving or getting gonorrhea again. Those with gonorrhea should be retested about three months after treatment of an initial infection, even if their partners received successful treatment.
If you've had gonorrhea and took medicine in the past, you can still get it again. This happens if you have sex without a condom with a person who has gonorrhea.
What happens if I don't get treated?
Untreated gonorrhea can cause serious and permanent health problems.
In women, untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are:
Formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes
Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the womb
)
Infertility (not being able to get pregnant)
Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain
In men, gonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles, which can, in rare cases, lead to infertility.
Rarely, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to your blood or joints. This condition can be life-threatening.
Untreated gonorrhea may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV.

SEPTEMBER 4, 2024
About Cysticercosis
KEY POINTS
Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae (young worms) of tapeworms.
You develop cysticercosis after swallowing tapeworm eggs.
Symptoms can occur months to years after infection
Overview
Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the parasite Taenia solium. This infection occurs after a person swallows tapeworm eggs. The larvae get into tissues such as muscle, brain, and eye, and form cysts called cysticerci. When cysts are found in the brain or central nervous system, it is called neurocysticercosis.
Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms depend on the location and number of cysts in your body. Symptoms can occur months to years after infection, usually when the cysts start dying.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Cysticercosis
How it spreads
You get cysticercosis when you swallow tapeworm (T. solium) eggs. The eggs are passed in the feces (poop) of someone with a tapeworm. Tapeworm eggs can get in or on food, water, or surfaces contaminated with feces. People swallow the eggs when they consume contaminated food or water or put contaminated fingers in their mouth. Autoinfection is when someone with a tapeworm infects themselves with tapeworm eggs. They can also infect others in the family. Eating pork cannot give you cysticercosis.
Keep Reading:
How Cysticercosis Spreads
Prevention
You can take steps to prevent cysticercosis.
Sanitation and hygiene precautions
Wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food.
Teach children the importance of handwashing to prevent infection.
Food precautions
Wash and peel fruits and vegetables before eating them.
Avoid food or water that may be contaminated.
When traveling in countries where the water supply may be unsafe, drink only
Bottled water
Water that has been boiled for one minute
Carbonated (bubbly) drinks in sealed containers
Diagnosis
If you think that you may have cysticercosis, please see your healthcare provider. They will ask you about:
Your signs and symptoms
Where you have traveled
Kinds of foods you eat
Diagnosing neurocysticercosis typically involves MRI or CT brain scans and sometimes blood tests. Blood tests might not show positive results in mild infections. If surgery is needed, a pathologist will examine the cyst for diagnosis.
See additional information on testing for intestinal tapeworm infections on the taeniasis site.
Treatment
Infections are generally treated with a combination of anti-parasitic drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgery is sometimes necessary to treat cysts depending on:
Location of the cyst
The patient's response to drug treatment
Amount of brain swelling
Treatment isn't always necessary for every case of cysticercosis. Even if you don't need treatment to kill the parasite, you may need treatment for the symptoms caused by the infection, such as medication to reduce seizures.

About Noise-Induced Hearing Loss
WHAT TO KNOW
Noise is all around us — at school, at home, and everywhere in between.
Noise is a significant source of hearing loss.
Prevention and early detection of hearing loss due to noise are important.
Recognize signs of hearing loss and get your hearing tested if you are at risk.
Overview
Hearing loss can occur:
in children and affect communication, language, and social skills.
in occupational settings and result in permanent injury for workers.
due to loud noise near the ear or repeated exposure to loud noise.
Exposure to loud noise can lead to noise-induced hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by participating in activities that produce harmful sound levels or by repeated exposures to loud sounds.
Some examples of noisy activities include:
Watching summer fireworks on the 4th of July
Mowing the lawn
Using power tools
Watching a sports game and cheering on your favorite team
Attending a concert
Recognize early signs of noise-induced hearing loss and take steps to protect your hearing.

About Nipah Virus
KEY POINTS
Nipah is a serious, and sometimes deadly, viral disease.
Nipah virus is spread by fruit bats and can make people and other animals sick.
Nipah virus can be spread from person to person.
Nipah outbreaks occur nearly every year in parts of Asia, often in Bangladesh and India.
Around 40%–70% of people with Nipah die.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
What it is
Nipah virus causes disease that can spread between animals and people. Nipah virus is carried by fruit bats (genus Pteropus), also known as flying foxes.
In 1999, Nipah was first discovered following an outbreak in pigs and people in Malaysia and Singapore. Three hundred people got sick and more than one hundred of those people died. In this first outbreak, bats initially spread the Nipah virus to pigs. People who worked closely with the infected pigs got sick, as well.
Nipah outbreaks have only been reported from Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore. However, the fruit bats that carry the Nipah virus are found throughout Asia, the South Pacific, and Australia.
View Larger
Fruit bats (yellow) are even found where Nipah outbreaks (red) haven't occurred.
Signs and symptoms
Nipah can cause mild to severe disease, including swelling of the brain and death.
People with Nipah are typically sick for 3 to 14 days with fever, headache, cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing. Later in the infection, some people may experience brain swelling, or encephalitis, where severe symptoms can include confusion, drowsiness, and seizures. People with these symptoms can fall into a coma within 24-48 hours.
How long it takes for signs to show
People with Nipah usually start getting sick 4-14 days after they were infected with the virus.
How it spreads
People can be infected with Nipah from:
Direct contact with infected animals, like bats or pigs
Consuming food or drinks, like fruit or raw date palm sap, that are soiled by infected animals
Close contact with body fluids of an infected person
A person may become infected by drinking raw date palm sap or eating fruit that is contaminated by an infected bat. This initial spread from an animal to a person is known as a spillover event.
Once a person is infected with Nipah, the virus can spread from person to person.
Reducing risk
Caregivers and healthcare providers caring for a patient with Nipah are at a higher risk of becoming infected.
If you travel to or live in an area where Nipah virus outbreaks have occurred, you should:
Wash your hands regularly with soap and water.
Avoid contact with flying fox bats or sick pigs.
Avoid areas where bats roost or
Avoid touching anything that could be soiled by bats.
Avoid eating raw date palm sap or fruit that could be soiled by bats.
Avoid contact with the blood or body fluids of someone with Nipah.
Tesing and diagnosis
Healthcare providers should consider Nipah for people with relevant symptoms who have been where the disease occurs, like Bangladesh or India.
Healthcare providers can test people for Nipah while they're sick or after they've recovered.
Treatment and recovery
Currently there are no licensed treatments for Nipah. Treatment is limited to supportive care, including rest, hydration, and treatment of other symptoms.

Nitrogen Mustard
Chemical Fact Sheet
KEY POINTS
Nitrogen mustards are chemical warfare agents that can cause skin blisters and damage to multiple parts of the body.
Usually, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately.
If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care.
Background
Nitrogen mustards were produced in the 1920s and 1930s as potential chemical warfare weapons. They are vesicants (agents that cause blisters) similar to the sulfur mustards.
The nitrogen mustards are also known by their military names of HN-1, HN-2, and HN-3.
Traits of nitrogen mustards include:
Fishy, musty, soapy, or fruity smell
Oily-textured liquid, gas, or solid
Liquids at room temperature
Clear, pale amber, or yellow-colored in liquid or solid form
Where it is found
Nitrogen mustards are not found naturally in the environment.
The nitrogen mustards were never used in warfare.
HN-1 originally was designed to remove warts but was later found to be a potential chemical warfare agent.
HN-2 was designed as a military agent but was later used in cancer treatment. Other treatment agents have now replaced it.
HN-3 was designed only for military purposes.
How it works
Nitrogen mustards are powerful irritants. This means it is a substance that can cause pain, itching, or discomfort.
Nitrogen mustards can damage the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. They can enter the body's cells very quickly and damage the immune system and bone marrow.
Signs and symptoms
Effects caused by nitrogen mustards depend on the amount, how someone was exposed, and how long they were exposed.
Usually, signs and symptoms of nitrogen mustard exposure do not happen immediately. Depending on the level of exposure, symptoms may not occur for several hours.
Nitrogen mustard can have different effects on specific parts of the body. Showing these signs or symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to a nitrogen mustard.
Brain
The following may happen after a large exposure:
Incoordination
Seizures
Tremors
Digestive tract
The following may happen after exposure:
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Nausea
Vomiting
Eyes
The following may happen after exposure:
Eye irritation
Pain
Swelling
Tearing
High levels of nitrogen mustard can cause burns and blindness.
Respiratory (breathing) tract
The following may happen within hours:
Cough
Nose and sinus pain
Shortness of breath
Sore throat
Fluid in the lungs is uncommon.
Skin
Redness usually develops within several hours after exposure. Blisters show up within 6 to 12 hours.
Exposure
Air
People could be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing it in. Because it is heavier than air, nitrogen mustard gas will sink to lower areas.
Water
People can be exposed by touching or drinking the water. People can also be exposed by touching liquid nitrogen mustards directly.
What to do if you are exposed
Because no cure exists for nitrogen mustard exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it.
If the nitrogen mustard release was indoors, get out of the building.
If the release was outdoors, move away from the area, stay upwind if possible, and go to higher ground. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the chance of death.
Evacuate or ""shelter-in-place""
If you are near a nitrogen mustard release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.
If you were exposed
Take your clothes off, wash your body, and get medical care as quickly as possible. If you swallowed nitrogen mustard, do not force vomiting or drink fluids. Get medical attention right away.
Take your clothes off
Remove the clothing as quickly as possible. Cut clothes off instead of pulling it over the head. If you are helping others, do not touch unsafe areas and take off the clothes quickly.
Wash your body
As quickly as possible, wash any nitrogen mustard from your skin with lots of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will help protect you from any chemicals on your body.
If your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes.
If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the dirty clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts).
If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them.
Throw your clothes away
After you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Do not touch unsafe areas of the clothing. If you have to touch unsafe areas, or you aren't sure where the unsafe areas are, wear rubber gloves. You can also use tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects to put the clothing in the bag.
Anything that touches the dirty clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too.
Tie the bag, and then put that bag inside another plastic bag. Throwing away your clothes this way helps protect you and others from any chemicals that might be on your clothes.
When the local or state health department or emergency team arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency team will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself.

About Getting Clean
Treatment
No cure exists for nitrogen mustard exposure.
Treatment involves removing nitrogen mustard from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital setting.
Long-term health effects
The long-term health effects depend on the way in which you were exposed:
Bones
Nitrogen mustards may cause bone marrow suppression beginning as early as 3 to 5 days after exposure. Bone marrow suppression can cause anemia, bleeding, and higher chances of infection. If severe, these effects could lead to death.
Breathing
Breathing in large amounts of the gas can cause chronic respiratory disease (long-term breathing issues).
Cancer
Prolonged (long exposures) or repeated exposures to nitrogen mustards have caused cancer in animals. There is some evidence that prolonged or repeated exposures to nitrogen mustards cause leukemia (cancer of the blood) in humans.
Eyes
High levels of eye exposure can cause long-lasting eye problems.
Skin
Liquid nitrogen mustard is more likely to cause second- and third- degree burns and later scarring than the gas form.

About Nocardiosis
KEY POINTS
Nocardiosis is a disease caused by bacteria found in soil.
It can affect the lungs, brain, and skin.
Nocardiosis is most common in people with weakened immune systems.
The disease is treated with commonly available antibiotics.
The infection can prove fatal in as many as 4 out of 10 cases.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Nocardiosis is a disease caused by bacteria found in soil. It can affect the lungs, brain, and skin. While the disease can be treated with commonly available antibiotics, it can be fatal in 4 out of 10 cases.
In the United States, about 500-1,000 new cases of nocardiosis occur every year. About 6 in 10 people who get nocardiosis have weakened immune systems.
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms of nocardiosis can be different depending on which part of your body is affected.
Nocardiosis usually affects the lungs. If your lungs are infected, you can experience:
Fever
Weight loss
Night sweats
Cough
Chest pain
Pneumonia
If you get a lung infection from nocardia, the infection can spread to your brain. If your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) is infected, you can experience:
Headache
Weakness
Confusion
Seizures
Nocardiosis and skin infections
You can get a skin infection when soil containing Nocardia bacteria gets into open wounds or cuts in your skin. Farming or gardening without gloves and protective clothing increases the risk of cuts, thorn pricks, or other minor injuries.
If your skin is infected, you can develop skin ulcers or shallow sores. You might also have nodules, which are growths beneath the surface of the skin. Sometimes, the nodules drain when the infection spreads to your lymph nodes.
People at risk
People who have had an organ transplant and people with very weak immune systems have a higher risk for nocardiosis
Several diseases and conditions can cause people's immune systems to be weak. These include:
Diabetes
Cancer
HIV/AIDS
Alcoholism
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (when the lungs' air sacs get plugged)
Connective tissue disorder that affects muscles and ligaments
Having had a bone marrow or solid organ transplant
Taking high doses of drugs called corticosteroids
Men have a greater risk of getting the infection than women. In fact, for every woman who gets nocardiosis, there are about 3 men who get the disease.
How it spreads
Nocardiosis is a disease caused by a type of bacteria called Nocardia that is found in the environment. It's typically in standing water, decaying plants, and soil.
Nocardia and other related bacteria are considered opportunistic germs. These are bacteria that infect people and animals when the conditions are right.
They can cause severe infections in people with weakened immune systems who have difficulty fighting off infections. People with cancer or those taking certain medications like steroids could have weakened immune systems.
Infection occurs when:
Someone breathes in dust that contains the bacteria
Soil or water carrying nocardia bacteria gets into the skin through a cut
A hospitalized patient gets the bacteria in their surgery wound via contaminated medical equipment
Nocardiosis can show up in the body as a skin or lung infection. It can also occur as an infection that has spread throughout the body (disseminated infection).
In the United States, nocardiosis most often shows up as a lung infection. No matter the cause, nocardiosis needs to be treated. If not, it can spread to other parts of the body, including the spinal cord and the brain.
The brain is the most common site of disseminated infection.
Fact
More than 8 in 10 of patients die after developing nocardiosis of the brain or spinal cord. The risk for death is much higher for patients with very weak immune systems.
Prevention
If you have a weakened immune system, you should take certain precautions when working in the soil:
Wear shoes and gloves.
Wear clothing covering your skin
Bandage open wounds and cuts.
If you have had an organ transplant, you might be given antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections. Some studies have shown this might prevent nocardiosis.
Outbreaks of nocardiosis in hospitals are rare. A few outbreaks have been linked to other patients and healthcare workers. One outbreak occurred from the release of bacteria in the air during hospital construction work. Hospitals maintain strong infection control practices to avoid outbreaks of nocardiosis.
Diagnosis
Talk to your doctor if
you have an injury that won't heal or you're having nocardiosis symptoms. You should also tell your doctor how you were wounded. That information helps with getting a correct diagnosis and the best treatment.
Your healthcare provider can help you find out if you have nocardiosis by performing tests that look for the bacteria. Your healthcare provider may need to take samples from an infected part of your body. For example:
Lungs
Mucus from the lower airways
Skin
Brain tissue
Treatment
People with nocardiosis may need to take multiple antibiotics for several months. Sometimes, antibiotic treatment lasts up to a year or more. Longer treatments are meant to prevent symptoms from returning. In addition to treatment, abscesses or wound infections may need to be surgically drained.
Some types of Nocardia bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics. So, laboratory testing is needed to find out which type (species) is causing the infection. Healthcare providers might run tests to find out which antibiotic treatment will stop your infection.

About Noise-Induced Hearing Loss
WHAT TO KNOW
Noise is all around us — at school, at home, and everywhere in between.
Noise is a significant source of hearing loss.
Prevention and early detection of hearing loss due to noise are important.
Recognize signs of hearing loss and get your hearing tested if you are at risk.
Overview
Hearing loss can occur:
in children and affect communication, language, and social skills.
in occupational settings and result in permanent injury for workers.
due to loud noise near the ear or repeated exposure to loud noise.
Exposure to loud noise can lead to noise-induced hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by participating in activities that produce harmful sound levels or by repeated exposures to loud sounds.
Some examples of noisy activities include:
Watching summer fireworks on the 4th of July
Mowing the lawn
Using power tools
Watching a sports game and cheering on your favorite team
Attending a concert
Recognize early signs of noise-induced hearing loss and take steps to protect your hearing.

About Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) Infections
KEY POINTS
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are bacteria found in soil, dust and water.
Although anyone can get an NTM infection, some groups are at increased risk.
Treatment varies and typically requires seeing a specialist.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are bacteria (germs) found in soil, dust and water. NTM do not include M. tuberculosis (the cause of tuberculosis) or M. leprae (the cause of Hansen's disease).
Anyone can get an NTM infection but people with underlying lung disease or weakened immune systems are at increased risk. Health departments and healthcare facilities play an important role in preventing NTM infections.
Types and strains
There are more than 190 recognized species (types) of NTM. Some cause disease in humans.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of NTM infection depend on the site of infection but can include:
Blood in the sputum
Cough
Decreased appetite
Fever
Loss of energy
Night sweats
Rashes
Shortness of breath
Weight loss
NTM commonly causes infections in:
Lungs
Skin and soft tissue (typically from surgery, trauma, injection, etc.)
Areas in/on the body with medical devices
Lymph nodes (common in children)
Blood or other usually sterile locations in the body (more common in patients with weakened immune systems or invasive medical devices or after procedures)
Exposure risks
Exposure to NTM can happen through contaminated water sources in many places, such as:
Natural water sources (e.g., rivers and streams).
Municipal water sources (e.g., water that people drink or shower in).
Shower heads and sink faucets.
Hydrotherapy equipment, such as jetted therapy baths.
Ice machines.
Decorative fountains and water features.
Settings with increased risk include:
Tattoo parlors.
Nail salons.
Hot tubs or spas.
Healthcare settings.
NTM outbreaks typically happen in healthcare settings if procedures expose patients to contaminated water.
Who is at risk
Anyone can get an NTM infection. People who already have a lung disease or weakened immune systems are at increased risk.
Lung infections most commonly occur in patients who already have a lung disease such as:
Cystic fibrosis
Bronchiectasis
Emphysema
How it spreads
NTM can live in water or surfaces in moist environments, such as inside pipes that carry water through buildings. When water contaminated with NTM aerosolizes (turns into a fine mist or spray), like the steam from your shower head or a hot tub, people inhale the bacteria.
NTM can cause infections in sites where people received surgery or injections.
NTM infections don't typically spread person to person.
Prevention
Healthcare facilities should develop an effective water management program to prevent healthcare-associated infections caused by NTM.
Public health departments can support NTM prevention and outbreak response.
Treatment and recovery
Treatment typically requires consultation with an infectious disease or pulmonary specialist.
NTM are resistant to many antibiotics, making infections more difficult to treat.
Treatment varies but often requires a combination of 2 to 3 antibiotics for 6 months to a year or longer.
Related conditions
Mycobacterium abscessus is a group of environmental mycobacteria also found in water, soil and dust.
