Obesity and Cancer
KEY POINTS
Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of getting cancer.
Keeping a healthy weight is an important step you can take to lower your risk of getting cancer.
Overview
People are overweight or have obesity when they weigh more than what doctors consider a healthy weight for their height.
Body mass index (BMI) is used as a screening tool for overweight and obesity. For adults, a person with a BMI from 25.0 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A person with a BMI that is 30.0 or higher has obesity. About 2 in 5 adults in the United States have obesity.
For children and teens, BMI is calculated the same way, but interpreted in a different way. A child's or teen's BMI is compared to those of the same sex and age. About 1 in 5 children and adolescents in the United States have obesity.
Obesity-associated cancers
Being overweight or having obesity are associated with a higher risk of getting 13 types of cancer. These cancers make up 40% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States each year.
Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
Breast (in women who have gone through menopause).
Colon and rectum.
Uterus.
Gallbladder.
Upper stomach.
Kidneys.
Liver.
Ovaries.
Pancreas.
Thyroid.
Meningioma (a type of brain cancer).
Multiple myeloma.
Thirteen cancers are associated with overweight and obesity.
How overweight and obesity can lead to cancer
Overweight and obesity can cause long-lasting inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and sex hormones. These changes may lead to cancer. The risk of cancer increases with the more excess weight a person gains and the longer a person is overweight.
How to lower your risk
To reduce your risk of obesity-associated cancer, you can follow a healthy eating plan and get regular physical activity. If you are concerned about your weight or your child's weight, talk to your doctor.

gives tips for cancer survivors to improve physical activity and healthy eating.
How doctors can help their patients prevent or treat obesity
Health care providers can help patients reach a healthy weight in several ways. For example, they can:
Measure patients' weight, height, and BMI.
Explain that keeping a healthy weight can lower a person's cancer risk.
Connect patients and families with community services that provide healthy food and ways to be active.
Refer patients with a high BMI who want to lose weight to intensive lifestyle programs. These programs help patients change their physical activity and diet to lower their weight. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends such programs for adults
and children,
and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends programs for children.
Discuss the use of medications,
surgery,
and other treatments
for excess weight in older children and adults.
Number of new cancers associated with obesity
CDC's Data Visualizations tool provides data on new obesity-associated cancers in the United States. For example:
More than 693,000 obesity-associated cancers occurred in the United States in 2021, including more than 212,000 among men and 481,000 among women.
Breast cancer after menopause is the most common obesity-associated cancer among women. Colorectal cancer is the most common obesity-associated cancer among men.
More than 90% of new obesity-associated cancers occur in people who are 50 or older.
Note: The data for obesity-associated cancers are based only on cancer type and do not estimate the proportion of cancers caused by obesity.

Preventing Childhood Obesity: 6 Things Families Can Do
KEY POINTS
Childhood obesity is a complex disease with many contributing factors, including genetics, eating patterns, physical activity levels, and sleep routines. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and other health issues. Although there is no one solution, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits.
Why it matters
About 1 in 5 American children have obesity. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure.
Obesity also has an impact on medical costs. Compared to children with healthy weight, total medical expenditures for children with severe obesity are $909 higher each year.
Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for stroke, many types of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death, and mental illness, such as clinical depression and anxiety.
Factors that influence obesity include genetics, eating patterns, physical activity levels, access to health care, and sleep routines. Also, conditions where we live, learn, work, and play can make healthy eating and getting enough physical activity difficult.
Though there is no one solution to addressing obesity, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits at home.
Here are ways families can help prevent obesity.
1. Model a healthy eating pattern
Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are often less expensive than fresh and are still good for you. Look for low sodium or no salt added vegetables and fruits packed in 100% fruit juice.
Adopting healthy eating patterns as a family helps children reach and maintain a healthy weight as they age. Eating a variety of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, lean protein foods, and low-fat and fat-free dairy products follows nutrition guidelines
and sets children and adults up for optimal health.
Help kids rethink their drink by replacing sugary drinks, such as soda, fruit drinks, and flavored milk, with water, 100% juice, or plain low-fat milk.
Hunger Hotline
For information about meal sites, food banks, and other services near you, call 1-866-3-HUNGRY (or 1-877-8-HAMBRE for Spanish).
Hours: 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET, Monday – Friday.
2. Move more as a family
Physically active youth have stronger muscles and bones, better cardiovascular fitness, and lower body fat than those who are inactive. Children aged 3–5 years should be physically active throughout the day. Children aged 6–17 years need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.
Help your children move more
and meet the physical activity recommendations by making it a family affair. Walking the family pet before and after school, riding bikes, and having races in the yard all count toward physical activity. Active chores, such as washing the car, vacuuming a room, or raking leaves, also count.
3. Set consistent sleep routines
Good sleep helps prevent type 2 diabetes, obesity, injuries, and problems with attention and behavior. Children who don't get enough sleep are at risk for unhealthy weight gain. Researchers are still trying to learn how sleep is linked to weight gain. Some reasons might include that lack of sleep can cause a child to eat more or to be less physically active because of to lack of energy.
Preschoolers need 10–13 hours of sleep per day, including naps. Children 6–12 years old need 9–12 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night, and youth 13–17 need 8–10 hours. Staying with a consistent sleep schedule, including on weekends, can help children sleep better.

4. Replace screen time with family time
During childhood, too much screen time can lead to poor sleep, weight gain, lower grades in school, and poor mental health. Reducing screen time can free up time for family activities and can remove cues to eat unhealthy food.
Turning off screens an hour before bed and removing screens from children's bedrooms can help reduce screen time and improve sleep. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends creating a family media plan
with examples of ways to reduce screen time.
5. Support obesity prevention in Early Care and Education
About 3 in 5 children birth through age 5 who are not yet in kindergarten are in a nonparental care arrangement at least once a week. The number of children in Early care and education (ECE) settings makes them among the best places outside the home to help young children build a foundation for healthy living. High-quality ECE programming can have a positive impact on a child's social-emotional wellbeing, educational achievement, health, and socioeconomic outcomes later in life.
Look for ECE settings supporting healthy infant feeding, healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time limits. When looking for ECE programs for your child, ask about policies and practices related to breastfeeding and feeding breast milk to infants, nutrition standards for the food served, access to outdoor physical activity during the day, and how much time the child will spend daily in front of a screen.
6. Find a Family Healthy Weight Program
If you are concerned about your child's weight, talk with their health care provider. They can assess the health risks related to excess weight. If your child has overweight or obesity, your health care provider may refer you to a family healthy weight program (FHWP). FHWPs are comprehensive, family-based lifestyle change programs to help children who are overweight or who have obesity make progress toward a healthier weight through positive behavior changes.

NIOSH Anthropometric Data and ISO Digital Headforms
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
In 2003, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a nationwide anthropometric survey of 3,997 subjects. The resulting head and face measurements were used to develop an anthropometric database detailing the face size distributions of respirator users using both traditional measurement methods and three-dimensional (3D) scanning systems. This database was used to establish fit test panels to be incorporated into NIOSH respirator certification and international standards. One of the panels developed, called the principal component analysis (PCA) panel, uses the first two principal components obtained from a set of 10 facial dimensions (age and race adjusted) and divides user population into five face-size categories. These 10 dimensions are associated with respirator fit and leakage and can predict the remaining face dimensions as well. Respirators designed to fit these panels are expected to accommodate more than 95% of the current U.S. civilian workers. From the 3,997 subje

Inhalation of polycarbonate emissions generated during 3D printing processes affects neuroendocrine function in male rats
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Three-dimensional printing (3DP) of manufactured goods has increased in the last 10 yrs. The increased use of this technology has resulted in questions about the health effects of inhaling emissions generated during printing. The goal of this study was to determine if inhalation of particulate and toxic chemicals generated during printing with polycarbonate (PC) plastic affected the neuroendocrine system. Male rats were exposed to 3D-printer emissions (500 µg/cm3) or filtered air for 1, 4, 8, 15 or 30d for 4d/week (4h/day). The effects of these exposures on hormone concentrations, and markers of function, injury and/or oxidative stress in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus and testes were measured after 1, 8 and 30d of exposure. Thirty days of exposure to 3D-emissions resulted in reductions in thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin. These changes were accompanied by increases in markers of cell injury and reductions in active mitochondria in the olfactory bulb, gonadotropin releasing hormone cells and fibers and tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabeled fibers in the arcuate nucleus, and reductions in spermatogonium. PC plastics contain high concentrations bisphenol A and these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the health effects of inhaling 3D-printer emissions may be due to bisphenol A.

Firefighter Body Dimensions for Updating Safety Specifications for Fire Apparatus and Firefighter Protective Equipment
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Up-to-date anthropometric information (body dimensions) of the U.S. firefighter population is needed for updating ergonomic and safety specifications for fire apparatus and firefighter protective equipment. Seventy-one measurements relevant to the design of seats, seat belts, cabs, turnout gear, gloves, and head-and-face gear are presented in this webpage. Forty of the 71 measurements were collected with the participants in fitted shorts in both standing and seated postures. Twenty-one of the 71 measurements were collected while the participants were wearing their personal turnout gear, including personal selection of tools stored in their pockets, in both standing and seated postures. Ten of the 71 measurements were hand- and head/face-related dimensions extracted from hand and head/face scans. The data obtained in this study provide the first available U.S. national firefighter anthropometric information which will benefit the design of future fire apparatus and protective equipment to better protect firefi

Trends in Worker Hearing Loss by Industry Sector, 1981-2010
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Background: The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of hearing loss for noise-exposed U.S. workers by industry sector and 5-year time period, covering 30 years. Methods: Audiograms for 1.8 million workers from 1981-2010 were examined. Incidence and prevalence were estimated by industry sector and time period. The adjusted risk of incident hearing loss within each time period and industry sector as compared with a reference time period was also estimated. Results: The adjusted risk for incident hearing loss decreased over time when all industry sectors were combined. However, the risk remained high for workers in Healthcare and Social Assistance, and the prevalence was consistently high for Mining and Construction workers. Conclusions: While progress has been made in reducing the risk of incident hearing loss within most industry sectors, additional efforts are needed within Mining, Construction and Healthcare and Social Assistance.

Anthropometric Database for the EMTs in the United States
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Deaths or serious injuries among emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and other ambulance occupants occur at a high rate during transport. According to a study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), EMTs and paramedics have higher fatality rates when compared to all workers, with forty-five percent of EMT deaths resulting from highway incidents, primarily due to vehicle collisions.1 Data from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration showed that among the persons killed in crashes involving an ambulance between 1992 and 2011, twenty one percent were EMTs and patients, while four percent were ambulance drivers.2 To reduce injury potential to the EMTs and other ambulance occupants, NIOSH, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. General Services Administration, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, along with private industry partners, have committed to improving the workspace design of ambulance patient compartments for safe and effective perfo

An Investigation Into the Relationship Between Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis and Dust Exposure in U.S. Coal Miners
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
The National Study of Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis (NSCWP) is a large, continuing epidemiologic study of the respiratory health of U.S. coal miners. By using information from the study, prevalence of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) was related to indexes of dust exposure obtained from research and compliance sampling data. Clear relationships between prevalences of both simple CWP and progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and estimated dust exposure were seen. Additional effects independently associated with coal rank (% carbon) and age were also seen. Logistic model fitting indicated that between 2% and 12% of miners exposed to a 2-mg/m3 dust environment in bituminous coal mines would be expected to have Category 2 or greater CWP after a 40-yr working life; PMF would be expected for between 1.3% and 6.7%. The risks for anthracite miners appeared to be greater. There was a suggestion of a background level of abnormality, not associated with dust exposure, but increasing with age. Although there are certain we

NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program Noise Measurement Database
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
This noise database was developed to provide researchers and other interested stakeholders with noise measurement results that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has collected during health hazard evaluation (HHE) surveys from 1996 through 2013. HHEs are requested by employees or their representatives, or employers, to help learn whether health hazards are present at their workplace. The scope of HHEs varies based on the requestors’ concerns and the NIOSH project officers’ professional judgment. Only noise measurement results are included in this database; however, many HHEs include evaluation of exposures other than noise. Individual HHE reports are published on the NIOSH website. When available, the database provides a direct link to the HHE report for each of the noise measurement results. The noise database contains workplace noise measurement results from 77 HHE reports, including over 808 personal noise exposure measurements and 582 area noise measurements. It also includes the following information: U.S. state or territory; Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) region; National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) sector; North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; facility description; type of dosimeter or sound level meter used; whether a hearing conservation program was in place; whether a hearing protection was used; whether octave band data was collected; job title; noise-generating activities; location of noise measurements; start and end date for site visit; type (full-shift, partial-shift, or task-based) and duration of noise measurement; type of noise (continuous, impulsive, or intermittent); exposure to ototoxic chemicals; and results in decibels A-weighted (dBA) and percent dose according to OSHA and NIOSH noise measurement criteria. This database is an ongoing project and will be updated at least yearly to add the most recent HHE noise measurement data.

Total Inward Leakage (TIL) for Respiratory Protective Devices
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Total inward leakage (TIL) is an estimate of the performance of a respirator, which is measured as the leakage of contaminants through the filter media and through the faceseal interface and exhalation valve of respiratory protective devices under laboratory conditions. Several test agents have been used to measure TIL in different countries. There is a lack of consensus on the most appropriate test method to measure TIL. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed a standard (ISO, 2014) on the comparison of TIL measurement using sodium chloride (NaCl) and corn oil aerosols, and sulfur hexafluoride gas. A comparison of the TIL values between different methods will enable the selection of a relatively suitable method for measuring TIL. NIOSH’s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) investigated the TIL values for respirators worn by test subjects exposed to NaCl and corn oil aerosols in two aerosol chambers side-by-side. Four air-purifying respirator categories, made

NPPTL Filtering Facepiece Respirators with an Exhalation Valve: Measurements of Filtration Efficiency to Evaluate Their Potential for Source Control
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are used extensively by healthcare personnel (HCP) during a pandemic. FFRs are primarily reserved for those personnel who have a greater risk and longer duration of exposure compared with other workers and the general public. Some FFR models contain an exhalation valve, which is a device that closes to allow inhaled breath to be pulled through the filter media and opens to allow exhaled breath to be expelled from the respirator through the exhalation valve as well as the filter media. These FFR models provide the wearer with a level of protection like that of an FFR without an exhalation valve, and they are thought to increase the wearer’s comfort at high work rates and be suitable for longer periods of use. However, respiratory secretions expelled by wearers may exit along with air through the exhalation valve. A concern with FFRs with an exhalation valve is that individuals may spread disease if unfiltered, virus-laden aerosols pass through the valve. During the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not recommend using an FFR with an exhalation valve for source control (i.e., to filter respiratory secretions to prevent disease transmission to others) and advised that if only this option isavailable and source control was needed, then the valve should be covered with a surgical mask, procedure mask, or a cloth face covering that does not interfere with the respirator fit. The CDC requested research to provide improved science-based recommendations on the use of exhalation valves. This study had three aims: (1) to measure the filtration efficiency provided by FFRs with an exhalation valve under conditions of inward airflow (i.e., in the direction of inhalation) and outward airflow (i.e., in the direction of exhalation); (2) to evaluate how particle penetration in FFRs with an exhalation valve compares to particle penetration in surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts; and (3) to determine the filtration efficiency of three modifications to the exhalation valve in FFRs with the goal of mitigating the emission of unfiltered particles. To accomplish these three aims, thirteen FFR models were each tested in two positions: inward position, which is used by the NIOSH Respirator Approval Program when testing N-type respirators, and outward position, which was used experimentally to channel airflow in the direction of exhalation. For the inward position, three mitigation strategies were used: (1)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with commonly available surgical tape, (2)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with an electrocardiogram (ECG) pad; and (3)stretching a surgical mask over the exterior of the FFR. The purpose of these three strategies was to measure the varying filtration efficiencies to determine their contribution toward source control. Both positions and all mitigation strategies were tested at three airflow rates: 25, 55, and 85 lpm (liters per minute). In addition to the FFR evaluations, researchers evaluated a selection of surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts using the outward position and flowrates described previously.

Prevalence of Hearing Loss in the United States by Industry, 2000-2008
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Background: Twenty-two million workers are exposed to hazardous noise in the United States. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss among U.S. industries. Methods: We examined 2000–2008 audiograms for male and female workers ages 18–65, who had higher occupational noise exposures than the general population. Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for hearing loss were estimated and compared across industries. Results: In our sample, 18% of workers had hearing loss. When compared with the Couriers and Messengers industry sub-sector, workers employed in Mining (PR = 1.65, CI = 1.57–1.73), Wood Product Manufacturing (PR = 1.65, CL = 1.61– 1.70), Construction of Buildings (PR = 1.59, CI = 1.51–1.68), and Real Estate and Rental and Leasing (PR = 1.61, CL = 1.51–1.71) had higher risks for hearing loss. Conclusions: Workers in the Mining, Manufacturing, and Construction industries need better engineering controls for noise and stronger hearing conservation strategies. More hearing loss research is also needed within traditional ‘‘low-risk’’ industries like Real Estate.

Systemic toxicity induced by topical application of perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) in a murine model
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Perfluoroheptaoinc acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) are synthetic chemicals belonging to the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) group that includes over 5,000 chemicals. PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA are short-chain PFAS (C7, C6, C5, respectively) that have been labeled as a safer alternative to the legacy PFAS perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS) which have been linked to numerous health effects. This class of chemicals are incorporated into consumer products such as stain resistant carpeting and textiles, nanosprays, medical devices, and fire-fighting foams. There is a high potential for occupational exposure and in the environment, short-chain PFAS have been detected in a variety of water sources leading to concerns for dermal exposure, however, these studies are lacking. In previous studies from our lab, PFOA was demonstrated to be absorbed via the skin and immunomodulatory. Also, the short-chain PFAS, PFBA, was found to have systemic toxic effects on mice with dermal exposure. In the present study, the systemic toxicity of a 28-day dermal PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA (1.25-5% w/v or v/v, or 31.25-125 mg/kg/dose) exposure was evaluated in a murine model.

Controlled Generation of Peracetic Acid Atmospheres for the Evaluation of Chemical Samplers
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
The goal of the experimental design and research presented herein was to produce peracetic acid (PAA) atmospheres suitable for evaluating PAA sampling methods in a controlled environment. To achieve this, generated test atmospheres must: enable simultaneous exposure of multiple samplers to equivalent atmospheres; maintain a continuous stable atmosphere for a duration to exceed experimental time frames; and produce a range of analyte concentrations, air velocities, temperatures and humidities. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (AGCIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for PAA is 0.4 ppm. The goal was to generate PAA atmospheres with concentrations from one tenth of the TLV up to 100 times the TLV. PAA is a reactive chemical, which presents some inherent challenges to generation of standard reference materials and atmospheres. PAA is a strong oxidant. PAA solutions are labile, thus it is difficult to keep reference standards or atmospheres. In solution, PAA and water are in equilibrium with acetic acid (AA) and hydrogen peroxide (HP). The equilibrium shifts as solutions of PAA evolve oxygen gas through the degradation of HP. Dynamic PAA atmospheres which are flowing and continuously refreshed are the preferred method for exposing samplers to equivalent atmospheres. Generation of static atmospheres by evaporating PAA solution into a closed container cannot be maintained for very long before needing to be refreshed. Dynamically generated atmospheres are created by a continuously renewed flow of air as a carrier and a source of PAA vapors, which are necessary for evaluating sensor performance over time frames relevant to occupational safety. Generation of PAA vapors can be accomplished from assisted vaporization, including applying heat and/or aerosolization with a nebulizer to accelerate evaporation. Glass reacts with PAA to hydroxylate the silica. used a glass syringe to deliver PAA solution to a nebulizer; however, gas bubbles formed in the syringe leading to uncontrollable ejection of the PAA solution from the syringe. To mitigate this, used acid washed syringes. They generated atmospheres of up to 2 ppm with a reported 95% recovery of theoretical delivered PAA. Dilute solutions of PAA can help to mitigate gas evolution but require more energy to evaporate and introduce additional humidity. For these experiments, PAA vapors were swept directly from the headspace above a PAA solution into our generation system. The flow rate of the air sweeping the headspace was varied to achieve the desired concentration after dilution into the carrier gas stream. When evaporating diluted PAA solutions using a nebulizer, the minimum humidity range is limited due to the water content in the dilute PAA solution. Thus, a wider humidity range on the low end is available when sweeping the headspace. The ability to maintain the concentration of PAA in the headspace above the solution is limited by the kinetics at the PAA solution-air interface. A practical solution was achieved using a PAA delivery system where air was passed through the headspace above a PAA solution in a vial. An impinger with a N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) analysis was used as the reference measurement for the PAA concentrations in the generated atmospheres.

Projectile Fluid Penetration and Flammability of Respirators and other Head/Facial Personal Protective Equipment (FPFPPE)
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires surgical masks (SMs) and surgical N95 respirators used in healthcare to meet certain fluid resistance and flammability levels. NIOSH’s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) investigated the fluid penetration and flammability of respirators and other head/facial personal protective equipment to determine their efficacy in reducing healthcare workers’ risk for occupational exposures to infectious microorganisms and injury due to accidental fires in surgical settings. The results from this study showed that FDA cleared SMs and surgical N95 respirators were resistant to synthetic blood penetration (Rengasamy et al. 2014) and met the flammability levels (Rengasamy et al. 2018) as expected. Seven out of eleven non-FDA cleared NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator models also passed the synthetic blood penetration and flammability tests. NPPTL tested five models of powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) hoods and all models showed

Respirator Performance against Nanoparticles under Simulated Workplace Activities Data
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHRs) are commonly used by workers for protection against potentially hazardous particles, including engineered nanoparticles (i.e., particles measuring less than 100 nanometers (nm). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of these types of respirators against 10-400 nm particles using human subjects exposed to NaCl aerosols under simulated workplace activities. Simulated workplace protection factors (SWPFs) were measured for eight combinations of respirator models (2 N95 FFRs, 2 P100 FFRs, 2 N95 EHRs, and 2 P100 EHRs) worn by 25 healthy test subjects (13 females and 12 males) with varying face sizes. Before beginning a SWPF test for a given respirator model, each subject had to pass a quantitative fit test. Each SWPF test was performed using a protocol of six exercises for three minutes each: (i) normal breathing, (ii) deep breathing, (iii) moving head side to side, (iv) moving head up and down, (v) bending at th

Evaluation of Propylene Glycol Methyl Ether as a Potential Challenge Agent for Leak Detection of Liquid and Headspace from Closed System Drug Transfer Devices using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Measurement of vapors from solutions containing propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) released inside a closed chamber were evaluated. Data used to quantify limits of detection, limits of quantification, bias, precision, and accuracy of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of vapors from 2.5 M PGME solutions are presented. The effects of ethanol as a component of the PGME solution were also evaluated. Liquid drops of PGME solutions and headspace vapors above PGME solutions were released to simulate leaks from Closed System Drug-Transfer Devices (CSTD)s. Using a calibration apparatus, an instrumental LOD of 0.25 ppmv and a LOQ of 0.8 ppmv were determined for PGME vapor. A LOD of 1.1 µL and a LOQ of 3.5 µL was determined for liquid aliquots of 2.5 M PGME solution released in the NIOSH chamber. Accurate quantitation of liquid leaks required complete evaporation of droplets. With the upper end of the usable quantitation range limited by slow evaporation of relatively large droplets and the lower end defined by the method LOQ, the method has a narrow quantitative range for liquid droplets. Displacement of 45 mL of vial headspace containing PGME vapor is the largest amount expected when using the draft NIOSH testing protocol. Release of an unfiltered 45 mL headspace aliquot within the NIOSH chamber was calculated to produce a concentration of 0.8 ppmv based on the Henry’s constant, which is right at the instrumental LOQ. Therefore, the sensitivity of the method was not adequate to determine leaks of PGME vapor from a headspace release through an air filtering CSTD when using the draft NIOSH testing protocols with an FTIR analyzer.

A model for detecting the effects of vibration on peripheral blood flow
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Exposure to hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) has been shown to result in cold-induced vasoconstriction and a reduction in blood flow to the hands and fingers of workers. Occupational exposure to HTV can also induce a hypersensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system to various stimuli, which in turn can result in vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels and blanching of the skin because of reductions in peripheral blood flow. The data presented were collected using an established animal model of vibration-induced white finger (Welcome et al. 2008) to determine if changes in blood flow induced by vibration exposure could be used as a biomarker for the development of vibration-induced peripheral vascular disease. Two separate experiments were done. In Experiment 1, changes in blood flow were measured in the ventral tail artery of the rat tail before and after a 4 h exposure to tail vibration (frequency 125 Hz, amplitude 5 g). These data were compared with those of animals that were restrained and had t

MicroRNA-Mediated Calcineurin Signaling Activation Induces CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, IL8 and Chemotactic Activities in 4,4’-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate Exposed Macrophages
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Occupational exposure to 4,4’-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the most widely used monomeric diisocyanate, is one of the leading causes of occupational asthma (OA). Pathophysiological mechanism(s) by which how MDI causes OA is still warranted to be elucidated. Alveolar macrophages are the most abundant immune cell type in the lung, and these cells serve as one of the first immune responders against inhaled pathogens, particles, stimuli, and chemical allergens such as dNCOs. Upon encountering outside stimuli, alveolar macrophages react by phagocytosis as well as producing and secreting different mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and others, into the alveoli microenvironment to orchestrate the initiation of inflammatory/immune responses. Dysfunction of alveolar macrophages, including elevated production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune mediators, has been shown to play an important role in asthma pathogenesis. In the clinical setting, the levels of many immune mediators produced by macrophages have been found elevated in the asthmatic airway. However, both the levels of these asthma-associated, macrophage-secreted inflammatory/immune mediators in MDI-OA patients’ airways and how expression of these mediators change in response to MDI exposure in alveolar macrophages are largely undetermined. Previously, we demonstrated a microRNA (miR)-206-3p and miR-381-3p mediated PPP3CA/Calcineurin signaling induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcription in macrophages and bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BALCs) after acute MDI exposure; however, whether this mechanism participates in regulation of other asthma-associated mediators secreted by macrophages/BALCs after MDI exposure is currently unknown. The first aim of this study was to identify candidate asthma-associated, macrophage-secreted mediators that can be regulated after MDI exposure. After identified the candidate mediators can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigated the roles of miR-mediated calcineurin signaling in regulation of these candidate mediators’ expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.

Potent Lung Tumor Promotion by Inhaled MWCNT
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
In the lung, carcinogenesis is a multi-stage process that includes initiation by a genotoxic agent, promotion that expands the population of cells with damaged DNA to form a tumor, and progression from benign to malignant neoplasms. We have previously shown that Mitsui-7, a long and rigid multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), promotes pulmonary carcinogenesis in a mouse model. To investigate the potential exposure threshold and dose-response for tumor promotion by this MWCNT, 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) initiated (10 μg/g, i.p., once) or vehicle (corn oil) treated B6C3F1 mice were exposed by inhalation to filtered air or MWCNT (5 mg/m3) for 5 hours/day for 0, 2, 5, or 10 days and were followed for 17 months post-exposure for evidence of lung tumors.

The effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on cardiovascular function
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
Air pollution serves as a major risk factor for the development of asthma, respiratory disease and heart disease. Diesel particulate and fumes are a major contributor to air pollution. Workers in a number of different occupations, including mining, oil and gas exploration and refining, and drivers of heavy equipment who are regularly exposed to diesel exhaust while on the job, and persons living in areas with high levels of air pollution, are at an increased risk for developing asthma, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Understanding the physiological and cellular effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on Various organs in the body is critical for identifying exposure-induced biological and physiological markers of disease or dysfunction. The experiments in this manuscript, focus on the effects of diesel exhaust (DE) inhalation on peripheral and cardiovascular function. In the current studies, we hypothesized that the development of cardiovascular disease in workers regularly exposed to DE is the result of the inhalation of volatile gases and particulate within the vapor that affect the cardiovascular system by altering physiological and cellular processes that affect peripheral vascular responsiveness to agents that cause blood vessels to constrict and vessels that cause blood vessels to dilate, blood pressure, cardiac output and kidney function (kidney function as it may contribute to changes in blood pressure). We also predicted that these changes in physiology would be associated with changes in the expression of proteins and the production of genes that play a role in regulating oxidative stress, responses to decreases in oxygen, and markers of kidney function that are associated with blood pressure.

National Occupational Mortality Surveillance (NOMS)
AT A GLANCE
Industry and occupation data are now publicly available in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).
Data are collected from all 50 states, New York City, and Washington, D.C.
We offer suggestions to help funeral directors document industry and occupation on death certificates.
We offer tips and tools to analyze these data.
About this program
NOMS is a collaboration between NIOSH, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and jurisdictions.
Working together, we assemble and code industry and occupation as part of death certificate data processing. The data then become part of the NVSS.
Access the data
Starting with 2020, data are available for public use. These data have also been added to our Worker Health Charts tool. Older data are not available publicly.
This surveillance program was developed in the 1980s to monitor changes in cause of death by usual occupation or industry in the United States. The initiative has evolved over time. Including industry and occupation data as part of the NVSS is a step forward for occupational health research.
Having industry and occupation in the NVSS enables researchers to:
examine changes in cause of death by usual occupation and industry,
identify new work-related health hazards, and
guide research and prevention activities.
Do you have questions about NOMS or industry and occupation death certificate data? Email us!
Completing the death certificate
Each jurisdiction has its own electronic death registration system (EDRS) with information collected based on the 2003 US Standard Certificate of Death. Jurisdictions use this information to issue death certificates.
Data for death certificates can be divided into two parts:
Cause of death is filled out by the medical examiner, coroner, or another type of medical certifier.
Demographic information is filled out by the funeral director with help from a decedent's informant. It includes narrative fields which describe the decedent's usual industry and occupation.
How to collect the best information
Funeral directors complete the death certificate demographic information. Public health professionals use this information to assess how work impacts health.
Information for funeral directors
Analyzing death certificate data
Preparing the data for analysis
Each jurisdiction collects and transmits the death certificate information to NCHS.
NCHS pulls industry and occupation narratives and sends them to NIOSH.
NIOSH then translates text to codes with expert coders and the NIOSH Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System (NIOCCS).
Once all industry and occupation information has been assigned a code, NIOSH returns the coded data to NCHS.
The industry and occupation codes are then sent back to the jurisdictions and added to the NVSS.
Tools and tips for analyzing these data

Occupational Risk Assessment
KEY POINTS
Exposure to on-the-job health hazards is a problem faced by workers worldwide.
Unlike safety hazards that may lead to injury, health hazards can lead to various types of illness.
Risk assessment allows NIOSH to make recommendations for controlling exposures in the workplace to reduce health risks.
Overview
Occupational risk assessment is a method for estimating health risks from exposure to various levels of workplace hazard(s). It is important to understand how much exposure to a hazard will present health risks to workers to appropriately eliminate, control, and reduce those risks. The aim of a risk assessment is to answer three basic questions:
What can happen?
How likely is it to happen?
What are the consequences if it does happen?
NIOSH conducts risk assessments on chemical hazards including:
carcinogens and non-carcinogens;
physical hazards such as noise, radiation, musculoskeletal injury;
and other hazards such as shift work.
See Current Intelligence Bulletin 69 in Selected Reports below to learn more about how NIOSH conducts occupational risk assessments.
Conducting risk assessments
NIOSH prioritizes chemicals for risk assessment by evaluating the needs of key stakeholders and partners such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Mining Safety and Health Administration, organized labor, industry, and National Occupational Research Agenda councils.

NIOSH also considers factors such as how much of the chemical is used in the workplace, how much potential there is for worker exposure, and the severity of the health effects. This includes an evaluation of the available scientific information on the hazard and its associated injury or disease.
NIOSH has a three-step process for conducting occupational risk assessments as shown below.
NIOSH 3-step process for conducting occupational risk assessments.
Impact
Risk assessments have direct impact among the occupational safety and health community, providing quantitative information on hazardous chemicals, of particular use to employers, workers, researchers, safety and health professionals, and standard- and recommendation-setting organizations.
Employers and occupational safety and health professionals
NIOSH risk assessments support NIOSH authoritative recommendations to reduce hazardous exposures to workers. Employers and occupational safety and health professionals can use this information to take precautionary measures to minimize exposure to workers from these hazards. These measures can include elimination, substitution with less hazardous chemicals, engineering controls, and the use of personal protective equipment.
Government agencies
NIOSH uses risk assessments in authoritative recommendations to reduce hazardous exposures to workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has incorporated NIOSH risk assessments into workplace standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also used NIOSH risk assessments to support environmental assessments. State agencies and other entities setting occupational exposure limits have used NIOSH recommendations based on risk assessments.
Researchers
NIOSH work on risk assessment methods has had an impact on the field of risk assessment by expanding the methods available and better characterizing exposure-response model uncertainty. Risk assessment methods development is a critical focus to provide the most statistically sound risk assessments. Methods to improve risk assessment modeling and characterization of model uncertainty include model averaging and semi-parametric modeling. These methods are important to assessing risk as often data regarding a particular hazard are scarce; these methods allow NIOSH staff to maximize the utility of available data.

About Skin Exposures and Effects
KEY POINTS
Chemicals can enter the body through the skin and injure individual organs or groups of organs
Workers in multiple industries and sector may face risks of absorbing chemicals through the skin
Absorbing workplace chemicals through the skin can cause diseases and disorders that include occupational skin diseases.
Skin Notation Profiles describe what happens when chemicals contact the skin.
Overview
Most efforts to address chemical hazards have focused on breathing chemicals in rather than absorbing through skin. Because of this, researchers have developed many ways to assess the effects of chemicals that workers inhale. However, there are fewer methods to assess skin exposures.
Skin Notation Profiles
NIOSH assigns skin notations for individual chemicals or chemical compounds. Skin notations describe what happens when chemicals contact the skin and directly damage organs or prompt the body's immune response. The immune response causes skin conditions like allergic contact dermatitis or skin irritation.
Occupational skin disease are one of the most common types of workplace diseases. They can take different forms, such as:
Rash (contact dermatitis) caused by skin irritation
Rash caused by skin allergies
Skin cancers
Skin infections
Other skin diseases
Dermal Absorption
Dermal absorption happens when a chemical goes through the skin and travels into the body. Many chemicals used in the workplace can damage organs if they penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream. Examples of these chemicals include pesticides and organic solvents.
How fast the skin absorbs chemicals depends largely on the outer layer of the skin called the stratum corneum. The stratum corneum provides a barrier by keeping molecules from passing into and out of the skin. This barrier protects the lower layers of skin. How much the skin absorbs chemicals depends on the following factors:
Skin integrity (damaged or intact)
The place on the skin where the chemicals are absorbed. This includes features like thickness and water content of stratum corneum and skin temperature.
Physical and chemical properties of the chemical
Concentration of the chemical on the skin surface
How long the skin absorbs the chemical
The surface area of skin that absorbs the chemical
Contact Dermatitis
Contact dermatitis, also called eczema, happens when the skin becomes inflamed from contact with a chemical. Contact dermatitis is the most common form of reported occupational skin disease. Research suggests that contact dermatitis makes up 90–95% of occupational skin disease cases in the United States.
Common symptoms of dermatitis include the following:
Itching
Pain
Redness
Swelling
Small blisters or wheals (itchy, red circles with a white center) on the skin
Dry, flaking, scaly skin that may crack
Types of Occupational Contact Dermatitis
Irritant contact dermatitis involves a chemical directly damaging and inflaming skin. The damage often occurs only to the place where the skin absorbs the chemical.
The following factors may cause irritant contact dermatitis:
Phototoxic responses (such as tar)
Brief contact with highly irritating chemicals (such as acids, bases, or oxidizing/reducing agents)
Mild irritants that cause damage over time (such as water, detergents, or weak cleaning agents).
Allergic contact dermatitis happens when a chemical that the skin absorbs causes the body's immune system to produce an allergic reaction. For this to happen, a worker must be sensitive or allergic to the allergen. When the skin absorbs the chemical allergen again, the chemical may cause an immune reaction that inflames the skin. The reaction can go beyond the place where the skin absorbed the chemical.
The following factors may cause allergic contact dermatitis:
Industrial compounds (such as metals, epoxy and acrylic resins, or rubber additives)
Agrochemicals (such as pesticides and fertilizers)
Commercial chemicals
The symptoms and the appearance of irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis are similar. Clinical testing (such as patch testing) is often necessary to tell the difference between them. Contact dermatitis can be mild or severe, depending on many factors that include the following:
Characteristics of the chemical
Concentration of the chemical
How often the skin absorbs the chemical
Environmental factors, such as temperature or humidity
Condition of the skin, such as healthy or damaged, dry, or wet

Office Environments and Your Safety
KEY POINTS
Maintaining a healthy office environment requires attention to various factors.
Having a well-designed office allows workers to be comfortable and safe while they do their work.
Overview
Workers should be able to work without needing to:
over-reach,
sit or stand for too long, or
use awkward postures (correct ergonomic design).
Sometimes, the best solution to allow workers to be comfortable while they work is to change the equipment or furniture.
Other times, it might be better to improve the tasks that workers do. For example, studies have shown that taking short breaks every hour helps reduce discomfort for those who work on computers.
Workers should be comfortable and safe while they work.
Risks
There are situations that can lead to injury or illness in workers who work in offices.
Some physical hazards that can lead to injury or illness include:
cords across walkways,
leaving low drawers open, or
objects falling from above.
Some task-related hazards that can lead to injury or illness include:
speed,
repetition,
duration, or
job control.
Some other hazards can be environmental (chemical or biological sources) or design-related hazards (such as nonadjustable furniture or equipment).
Job stress can happen when the job requirements do not match the capabilities or resources of the worker. This work-related stress may also lead to illness.
Steps to take
Employers and workers should consider the following factors when creating a healthy office environment:
Make sure there are no harmful chemicals in the office.
Have proper equipment and workstations.
Maintain a good physical environment.
Manage temperature, humidity, light, noise, air flow, and space.
Make sure that the tasks are designed correctly.
Consider psychological factors.
Think about personal interactions, work pace, and job control.
There are ways to maintain a healthy office environment.

Public Health
Overview
The oil and gas extraction industry is made up of three main types of companies:
Oil and gas operators develop and operate leased properties.
Drilling companies drill oil and gas wells and perform well control activities.
Well servicing companies provide specialized support services for existing wells.
Oil and gas extraction health and safety hazards are unique and complex. Oil and gas extraction workers are responsible for a wide range of work activities, including constructing oil and gas well sites, drilling and fracturing the wellbore, bringing fluids to the surface for transport to refineries, and providing maintenance and monitoring of well sites. The work primarily occurs outdoors in all environmental conditions, is physically demanding, and involves daily exposure to a variety of physical and chemical hazards as well as psychological stressors. Additionally, workers may experience long commutes and shift work. Due to the high-risk nature of oil and gas extraction work, this workforce has an elevated fatal occupational injury rate.
CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) includes an Oil and Gas Extraction Program conducts research, works with partners, and develops and communicates workplace solutions to improve worker safety and health in the oil and gas extraction industry.
What's being done
NIOSH partners with other organizations to encourage innovative research and improve workplace practices in the oil and gas extraction industry. NIOSH also facilitates the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA), a partnership program to stimulate innovative research and improved workplace practices. The sector council for oil and gas extraction brings together individuals and organizations who share an interest in improving safety and health in the oil and gas industry.

Older Adult Drivers
KEY POINTS
Each day, 25 older adults are killed and over 740 are injured in crashes.
Drivers aged 70+ have higher crash death rates per 1,000 crashes than middle-aged drivers (aged 35-54).
Taking key safety steps can help adults of all ages, including older adults, stay safe on the road.
Overview
Take steps to stay safe on roads
In 2022, there were almost 52 million licensed drivers ages 65 and older in the United States. This is a 77% increase since 2004.1
Driving helps older adults stay mobile and independent. But the risk of being injured or killed in a traffic crash increases as people age.
Thankfully, older adults can take steps to stay safer on the roads.
Facts
Thousands of older adults are injured or killed in the United States every year in traffic crashes.
In 2022, about 9,100 older adults were killed in traffic crashes, and over 270,000 were treated in emergency departments for crash injuries.2 This means that each day, 25 older adults are killed and over 740 are injured in crashes.
Risk factors
Age, sex, and age-related changes are major risk factors
Drivers aged 70+ have higher crash death rates per 1,000 crashes than middle-aged drivers (aged 35-54).3 Higher crash death rates among this age group are primarily due to increased vulnerability to injury in a crash.
Across all age groups, males have substantially higher crash death rates than females.4
Age-related changes in vision, physical functioning, and the ability to reason and remember, as well as diseases and medications, might affect some older adults' driving abilities.5
Prevention
Key steps to staying safe on the roads
The good news is that older adults are more likely to have safer driving behaviors than other age groups.
Taking these key steps can help adults of all ages, including older adults, stay safe on the road:
Always wear a seat belt as a driver or passenger
Seat belt use is one of the most effective ways to save lives and reduce injuries in crashes.6
Drive when conditions are safest
Drive during daylight and in good weather. Conditions such as poor weather7 and driving at night8 increase the likelihood of crash injuries and deaths.
Don't drink and drive
Drinking and driving increases the risk of being in a crash because alcohol reduces coordination and impairs judgment.
Additional steps to stay safe on the road
Use CDC's MyMobility Plan, a plan to stay mobile and independent as you age.
Follow a regular activity program to increase strength and flexibility.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to review medicines—both prescription and over-the counter—to reduce side effects and interactions. Read the Medications Can Be Linked to Injuries as We Age fact sheet to learn more.
Have your eyes checked by an eye doctor at least once a year. Wear glasses and corrective lenses as required.
Plan your route before you drive.
Find the safest route with well-lit streets, intersections with left-turn signals, and easy parking.
Leave a large distance between your car and the car in front of you.
Avoid distractions in your car, such as listening to a loud radio, talking or texting on your phone, and eating.
Consider potential alternatives to driving, such as riding with a friend, using ride share services, or taking public transit.

VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
JANUARY 25, 2024
About Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever
KEY POINTS
Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) is a rare disease caused by a virus spread by an infected tick or rodent.
OHF only occurs in certain areas of Siberia, Russia.
There is currently no treatment or vaccine for OHF.
Most people with OHF fully recover after 1 or 2 weeks.
What it is
Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) is caused by Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV). OHF was identified between 1945 and 1947 in Omsk, Russia.
OHF occurs in Russia--specifically, in the western Siberia regions of Omsk, Novosibirsk, Kurgan, and Tyumen.
While there is not treatment for OHF, most people recover after 1 or 2 weeks. About 5 to 30 people out of 1,000 with OHF die of the disease. OHF is rare and is unlikely to pose a public health threat to people living in the United States.
Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever is found in western Siberia.
Signs and symptoms
People with OHF may experience chills, fever, headache, severe body aches, and vomiting. After 3 or 4 days, symptoms can include diarrhea and unexplained bleeding from the nose, eyes, or rectum.
After being sick for 1 or 2 weeks, most people with OHF fully recover. However, some people may experience a second wave of symptoms, including fever and swelling of the brain, in the third week.
Rarely, OHF can cause hearing loss, hair loss, and behavior or psychological conditions. Long-term supportive care may be needed for people with symptoms that impair their motor skills.
Risk factors
People in rural or outdoor settings in western Siberia have a higher risk for OHF. These people are more likely to encounter infected ticks and rodents. This includes hunters, campers, forest workers, farmers, and muskrat trappers. People are more likely to be infected during the winter months.
Laboratory workers handling OHF specimens without proper personal protective equipment are also at risk.
How it spreads
People get OHF through tick bites or contact with the blood, feces, or urine of an infected animal, usually a rodent. Ticks that can spread OHF include Dermacentor reticulatus, Dermacentor marginatus, and Ixodes persulcatus. Rodents that can spread OHF include the muskrat, water vole, and narrow-skulled vole.
People cannot spread OHF to each other.
Though unusual, it is possible to get OHF without direct contact with ticks or rodents. The virus that causes OHF has been found in aquatic animals and water. The virus in the water could enter the body through broken skin or the eyes and nose. This would be extremely rare. There is even evidence that OHF can be spread by drinking the milk of goats or sheep infected with OHF.
Reducing risk
If you plan to spend time in rural or outdoor areas in western Siberia,
Prevent tick bites.
Avoid contact with muskrats, voles, and sick or dead animals.
There is no vaccine currently available for OHF. However, vaccines for another disease spread by ticks (tick-borne encephalitis) may offer some protection. These can be considered for high-risk groups, like muskrat hunters. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are traveling to the area and may have contact with animals.
Diagnosis
Healthcare providers can diagnose OHF with blood tests that detect the virus, like cell cultures and PCR. They may be able to tell if someone had OHF in the past by testing the blood for antibodies.

PARASITES 
MAY 13, 2024
About Filarial Worms
KEY POINTS
Filarial worms are a type of microscopic parasitic worm.
They mainly spread through insect bites.
Symptoms from filarial worm infections can be minor (e.g., itching or swelling) but may be severe (e.g., blindness).
There are antiparasitic drugs that can treat filarial worm infections.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Filarial worms are a family of parasites that are found in tropical regions. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Once they infect a person, they can cause diseases that attack different parts of the body.
Symptoms
Symptoms of filarial worm infections range from itching and swelling to disfigurement and blindness. However, many people infected with filarial worms will have no symptoms.
Diseases and common symptoms caused by filarial worms include
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, can cause itchy skin and skin changes and damage the eyes and may lead to blindness.
Lymphatic filariasis, sometimes called elephantiasis, can cause severe swelling of body parts, particularly legs, arms, genital area, and other parts of the body.
Loiasis, also known as Loa loa or African eye worm, can cause itchy, non-painful swellings on limbs or worms that move across the eye.
Mansonellosis, which can cause fever, fatigue, and joint and abdominal (belly) pain.
Causes and spread
Filarial worm diseases affect millions of people a year in Africa, South America, the Pacific islands, and Asia. They spread mostly through the bites of insects like blackflies, mosquitoes, or midges.
Tiny immature worms, known as larvae, will enter a human body when the insect bites into the skin. Once inside a person, they spread throughout the body, grow, and reproduce. When an insect bites an infected person, the insect can ingest the new larvae and eventually infect another person.
Prevention
In most cases, the best way to prevent most filarial worm infections is to avoid insect bites. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using insect repellent on exposed skin, and sleeping under mosquito nets will help prevent insects from biting you.
Treatment
Medications known as antiparasitic drugs can treat new filarial worm infections. In people with advanced disease-causing chronic swelling, surgery or lymphedema care may be needed.
Onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis are currently the target of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns. These campaigns deliver safe and inexpensive drugs aimed at reducing or eliminating transmission of these infections. For some, filaria MDA will reduce symptoms as well. For others, other treatments are needed for symptoms.

Preventing Opioid Overdose
WHAT TO KNOW
Overdoses are the leading injury-related cause of death in the United States.
Opioids, mainly illegally made fentanyl, are involved in the highest percentage of overdose deaths.
Ways to prevent opioid overdose are to improve opioid prescribing, reduce exposure to opioids, prevent illegal opioid use and prescription opioid misuse, and treat opioid use disorder.
Opioid use disorder and overdoses are preventable
When we act early, we can prevent illegal substance use, including illegal opioids, and misuse of prescription medications, like opioids, that can lead to substance use disorders.
Substance use disorders, like opioid use disorder (OUD), impact communities across America. Prevention activities help educate and support individuals, families, and communities and are critical for maintaining both individual and community health.
Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), sometimes referred to as ""opioid dependence"" or ""opioid addiction,"" is a problematic pattern of opioid use that causes significant impairment or distress. OUD is a medical condition that can affect anyone – regardless of race, gender, income level, or social class. Like many other medical conditions, evidence-based treatments are available for OUD, but seeking treatment remains stigmatized. Stigma can be a major barrier to how well prevention and treatment programs work amid the opioid crisis.
Keep in mind
Stigma or the fear of stigma may stop someone from sharing their health condition with partners or family members. Stigma may come from a specific person, including a loved one or clinician, or from the larger community. People seeking treatment for OUD may find that some clinicians have stigmatizing attitudes about OUD. Stigmatizing attitudes toward people with OUD among clinicians can create barriers for those seeking the health services they need.1 People who experience health-related stigma may also experience less access to treatment or reduced adherence to treatments.2 Learn more about what you can do to reduce stigma.
OUD significantly contributes to overdose deaths among people who use illegal opioids or misuse prescription opioids. Opioids—mainly synthetic opioids like illegally made fentanyl--are currently the most represented in overdose deaths.
A recent study among 29 states and the District of Columbia showed the percentage of overdose deaths involving counterfeit pills more than doubled from July 2019 to December 2021, and more than tripled in the Western United States. These pills are dangerous because they typically appear as pharmaceutical pills but often contain illegally made fentanyl and illegal benzodiazepines or other drugs, with or without people's knowledge.
For every overdose that results in death, there are many more nonfatal overdoses, each one with its own emotional and economic toll.3 OUD and overdose deaths continue to be a major public health concern in the United States, but they are preventable.
People can help reduce the risk of counterfeit pill overdose by:
Only taking pills prescribed to them
Being aware that pills bought illegally might contain highly potent drugs
Using fentanyl test strips (FTS), small strips of paper that can detect the presence of fentanyl in all different kinds of drugs (cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, etc.) and drug forms (pills, powder, and injectables)
Get the facts
Overdoses are the leading injury-related cause of death in the United States and appear to have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic.4
In 2022, 107,941 people died from drug overdoses, which equates to 296 overdoses each day.5
Among the 2022 overdose deaths, nearly 76% involved an opioid.5
Research shows that people who have had at least one overdose are more likely to have another.6
In 2022, an estimated 54.6 million Americans needed substance use disorder treatment, but only 13.1 million people with a substance use disorder in the past year received treatment.7
International Overdose Awareness Day
On August 31 of each year, International Overdose Awareness Day (IOAD) is recognized globally as a day to remember and grieve those that we've lost, take action to encourage support and recovery, and help end overdose by spreading awareness about drug overdose prevention. Join us as an IOAD partner by using your voice and platforms to spread messages about ending overdose.

Promising prevention strategies
Ways to prevent opioid overdose are to improve opioid prescribing, reduce exposure to opioids, prevent illegal opioid use and prescription opioid misuse, and treat opioid use disorder. There are strategies that can help prevent overdose and support the health and well-being of communities.
Promote and support the use of the CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain.
Utilize prescription drug monitoring programs, which are state-run databases that track prescriptions for controlled substances and can help improve opioid prescribing, inform clinical practice, and protect those at risk.
Learn about the risks of prescription opioids and about the help and resources that are available for someone who may be experiencing opioid use disorder. See CDC's Rx Awareness Campaign for shareable resources and information on improving awareness.
Learn more about the dangers of illegally made fentanyl and ways to protect yourself and others, like using fentanyl test strips.
Treat opioid use disorder by increasing access to substance use disorder treatment services, including Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD). Recovery is possible.
Reverse overdose by expanding access to naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose, for community members (family members and neighbors) and service providers (i.e., first responders).
Help communities put effective practices to work by using evidence-based strategies [PDF]
How to recognize an overdose
Recognizing an opioid overdose can be difficult. If you aren't sure, it is best to treat the situation like an overdose—you could save a life. Administer naloxone or another opioid overdose reversal medication (if available) and then call 911. Try to keep the person awake and breathing and lay the person on their side to prevent choking. Do not leave the person alone.

Signs of an overdose may include:
- Unconsciousness or inability to awaken
- Slow or shallow breathing or difficulty breathing such as choking sounds or gurgling/snoring noise from a person who cannot be awakened
- Discolored skin (especially in nails or lips)
- Small, constricted ""pinpoint pupils"" that don't react to light
Find treatment for substance use disorder, including opioid use disorder
If you or someone close to you needs help for a substance use disorder, talk to your doctor or call SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP or go to SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator

About Liver Flukes
KEY POINTS
Liver flukes are parasites that can infect humans and cause liver and bile duct disease.
There are two families of liver flukes that cause disease in humans: Opisthorchiidae (which includes species of Clonorchis and Opisthorchis) and Fasciolidae (which includes species of Fasciola).
These two families of liver flukes differ in their geographic distribution, life cycle, and long-term outcome after clinical infection.

Liver Flukes
Clonorchiasis (Clonorchis Infection)
Clonorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Clonorchis (also known as Chinese liver fluke disease), is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
You cannot get Clonorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Clonorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).
Fasciola (Fascioliasis Infection)
Fasciola is a liver fluke that can infect the liver and bile duct of exposed people and animals, such as sheep, cattle, goats, and other plant-eating domestic and wild animals.
Fasciola parasites can cause an infectious disease called fascioliasis. Generally, fascioliasis is more common in people who live or work around livestock (e.g., sheep, cattle, goats) in areas where animal infections are common.
Two Fasciola species can infect people:
Fasciola hepatica: the main species that infects people. Other names are ""the common liver fluke"" and ""the sheep liver fluke.""
Fasciola gigantica: a related species that primarily affects domestic and wild animals but can also infect people.
Fascioliasis occurs in all continents except Antarctica, in over 70 countries, especially where there are sheep, cattle, or goats.
In most cases, people can get Fasciola infection by eating raw watercress or other freshwater plants contaminated by larvae.
People can get infected by consuming contaminated water that they drink. People can also get infected by eating vegetables that they washed or irrigated with contaminated water.
People cannot get Fasciola from another person.
Opisthorchis (Opisthorchis Infection)
Opisthorchis is a liver fluke (type of parasitic worm) that can infect the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.
Opisthorchis is part of the Opisthorchiidae family of liver flukes.
There is Opisthorchis viverrini (i.e., the Southeast Asian liver fluke) and O. felineus (i.e., the cat liver fluke).
You cannot get Opisthorchis from another person, and you cannot get it from consuming untreated drinking water.
Opisthorchis infections can last for several years (the lifespan of the parasite).

Orf Virus (Sore Mouth Infection)
EXPLORE TOPICS

MAY 13, 2024
About Orf Virus (Sore Mouth Disease)
KEY POINTS
Sore mouth disease or ""orf"" mostly affects sheep and goats.
People can get it too if they have contact with infected animals.
People get painful sores and also sometimes have a fever or other symptoms.
People and animals usually recover without long-term effects.
What it is
Sore mouth disease is caused by orf virus, a type of poxvirus. It occurs worldwide, anywhere sheep, goats and similar animals live.
People can get painful sores called lesions if they have contact with animals infected with orf virus. Certain activities like feeding, petting and getting bitten by infected animals put people more at risk for infection.
Simple prevention steps can protect people from the virus, even if they are handling infected animals infected with orf.
Signs and symptoms
An animal infected with orf virus typically has sores (lesions) around its lips and muzzle and in its mouth.
People infected with orf virus usually get sores or nodules on their hands or forearms. This rash is infectious, meaning it can spread to areas of a person's body if they scratch or touch the sores. The sores progress through stages over six weeks. They may also have mild fever, tiredness or swelling of the glands in their neck and underarms (lymph nodes).
People with weakened immune systems can develop more serious symptoms if they get infected with orf virus. They may have multiple sores or large tumor-like sores. They may also develop a second type of rash that isn't infectious (called erythema multiforme).
How it spreads
People can get sore mouth disease if they have a cut or abrasion and touch an animal with orf virus. People can also get orf by handling equipment used with sick animals.
Activities that may put people at more risk for infection include:
Bottle feeding, tube feeding or shearing sheep or goats
Petting or having casual contact with the sores of infected animals
Handling infected animal equipment such as a harness
Being bitten by an infected animal.
Orf virus does not spread between people.
People can get infected with orf virus multiple times. Infections after the first one are usually less severe and may heal faster.
Reducing risk
Wear rubber or latex gloves when handling sheep or goats. This is especially important if you have cuts on your hands or are touching an animal's mouth or muzzle.
Wash your hands often with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially if they look dirty. If there is no soap and your hands aren't visibly dirty, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Testing
CDC offers a test that can determine if your sores are caused by orf virus. Healthcare providers or health departments can send lesion specimens to CDC for testing. More information is available in the CDC test directory. CDC also has tools to help with diagnosis and can be reached at (404) 639-4129.
Members of the public should contact their healthcare provider or county/state health department for more information.
Treatment and recovery
There is no specific treatment to cure orf virus infection. But it's important to protect the sores from getting infected with other germs.
Keep the sores dry and covered with a bandage. Use a bandage that keeps water out when working with animals or doing manual labor. If your sores are dry at bedtime, keep them uncovered while you sleep. If they are wet, cover sores loosely with a bandage. This will help them heal faster.
See your doctor if you have pain, fever or if your sores are getting bigger or spreading. If this occurs, it could mean your sores are due to a different, more serious germ. Your doctor can help determine what's going on.

FEBRUARY 26, 2024
About Transplant Safety
KEY POINTS
Some organ transplantations are lifesaving procedures. However, serious illness, graft loss, and death can occur from undetected infections in donor organs and tissues.
Laboratorians must test donor organs and tissue for certain bacteria and viruses (for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, and syphilis, to name a few).
Overview
Transplant safety has two categories: organ safety and tissue safety.
Transplant transmitted infections are very rare; public health entities and academic groups suspect about 1% of transplants cause infections and have confirmed cases in far fewer. When these events occur, the complications can include graft failure or death. Efforts to improve transplant safety are ongoing, (for example, improvements to donor screening and donor testing) and informed by investigations of disease transmission from transplanted organs and tissues.
CDC is responsible for surveillance, detection, and warning of potential public health risks within the organ and tissue supply. These public health efforts increase transplant safety by reducing the potential for transmission of communicable diseases.
Fast facts
The most frequently transplanted organs in the United States are the kidney, liver, heart, and lungs. The most commonly transplanted tissues in the U.S. are bones, tendons, ligaments, skin, heart valves, blood vessels, and corneas.
On any given day, there are more than 100,000 people on active waiting lists for organs.
In 2022, there were approximately 15,000 deceased organ donors. On average, they donated 2.5 organs each.
Living donors donate approximately 6,000 organs on average per year.
Surgeons perform about 3.3 million tissue grafts each year and transplant approximately 2.5 million tissue grafts.
Health impacts
Although infrequent, transplants can transmit infections that affect patients' health, including:
Viruses
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Hepatitis C
Rabies virus
West Nile virus and other mosquito-transmitted viruses
Bacteria
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis)
Fungi
Protozoa
Parasites
Amebas
Balamuthia mandrillaris
Frequently asked questions

Can you get sick from a transplant?
How do hospitals acquire organs and tissues?
What are the screening and testing requirements for organ and tissue donation?
What are the reporting and investigation requirements following a suspected infection from transplanted organs or tissue products?
What CDC is doing
CDC helps the healthcare community, state, and local health departments trace diseased organs back to the original donor and identify people who may have received contaminated organs and/or tissue. This process informs regulatory decisions and risk reduction guidance for transplant safety.
CDC laboratories can also help test for and identify bacteria, viruses, etc. that may contaminate organs and tissues.

About Bartonella
KEY POINTS
Bartonella bacteria are spread to humans by fleas, body lice, sand flies, or contact with flea-infested animals.
There is no evidence that ticks spread Bartonella infection to people.
Cat scratch disease is the most common form of bartonellosis in the United States.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Overview
Several species of Bartonella bacteria cause disease in people. Infection with any one of these bacteria is referred to broadly as bartonellosis, although some forms of infection also have common names (for example, cat scratch disease).
For more information:
Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease)
Bartonella quintana infection
Bartonella bacilliformis infection
B. henselae is transmitted by the scratch of domestic or feral cats. Cats can have fleas that carry the bacteria.
B. quintana is transmitted by the human body louse.
B. bacilliformis is transmitted by bites from infected sand flies.
There is no evidence that Bartonella species can be transmitted to people by ticks. Transmission studies with ticks have only used mice and artificial feeding systems which do not demonstrate that a tick can spread bacteria to people or that the bacteria can survive in a tick for any length of time.

Osteoarthritis
KEY POINTS
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis.
It causes joint pain, stiffness, and swelling—usually in the hands, hips, back, or knees.
There is no cure for OA, but you can effectively manage it.
Overview
Osteoarthritis is a disease that breaks down one or more joints in the body.
It most commonly affects the hands, hips, back, and knees.
It can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in affected joint(s).
Over time, it can lead to changes in bone, cartilage, and other joint tissues—resulting in disability or making it hard for someone to do work or daily tasks.
OA is common among adults 45 and older. But it is not a regular part of aging.
There are things you can do to prevent or delay it.
There are also things you can do to manage it, if you develop it.
U.S. adults with osteoarthritis
About 33 million U.S. adults have OA.A
Signs and symptoms
People with OA may experience a wide range of symptoms. These can include:
Joint pain, especially when moving the joint.
Stiffness after resting a joint.
Swelling in and around the joint, especially after using it a lot.
Feeling like the joint is loose or unstable.
Less ability to move the joint.
Things that increase the risk for OA
Certain things can increase your chances of developing OA. These include:
Repetitive joint stress or injury—Injuring or over-using a joint can damage it and increase your risk of OA.
Obesity—Extra weight can affect a person's metabolism and increase the risk of OA, especially in weight-bearing joints like the hips or knees.
Family history—People who have a family member with OA may be at higher risk of developing it.
Older age—The chance of developing OA increases as people get older.
Sex—Women are more likely to develop OA than men, especially after age 50.
Also, people who already have OA in one body part are more likely to develop it in other joints.
Diagnosis
Finding out if you have OA
You should see a health care provider who specializes in arthritis, called a rheumatologist, to find out if you have OA.
A rheumatologist will diagnose OA by doing:
A physical exam.
X-rays.
Lab tests.
A review of your health history.
Treatment
What you can do
While there is no cure, there are proven ways to manage OA symptoms and reduce pain. For example, ways you can manage your arthritis include:
Being physically active.
Keeping a healthy weight.
Protecting your joints.
Talking to a health care provider about symptoms and care plans.
Learning skills to self-manage OA and improve quality of life.
CDC recognizes over 20 physical activity and self-management education programs that can help reduce OA symptoms like pain and disability.
Physical exercises may help relieve pain and improve function.
Medical Options for OA
Some adults with OA may need extra assistance from providers to help manage their symptoms. These may include:
Physical therapy to strengthen muscles around the affected joints.
Over-the-counter pain relievers or prescription drugs.
Supportive devices such as crutches or canes.
Joint replacement surgery if other treatments haven't worked.

About Other Spotted Fever Rickettsioses
KEY POINTS
Spotted fever rickettsioses are a group of diseases caused by closely related bacteria. These bacteria are spread to people through the bite of infected ticks and mites.
Symptoms can include a dark scab (eschar) at the site of the tick or mite bite, fever, headache, rash, and muscle aches.
Your healthcare provider may order certain blood tests to look for evidence of spotted fever infection.
Doxycycline is the recommended treatment for people of all ages.
MORE INFORMATION
For Everyone
Health Care Providers
Public Health
Overview
Spotted fever rickettsioses (spotted fevers) are a group of diseases caused by closely related bacteria, spotted fever group Rickettsia. These bacteria are spread to people through the bite of infected mites and ticks. The most serious reported spotted fever in the United States is Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF).
Other causes of spotted fevers in the United States include:
Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, caused by Rickettsia parkeri
Pacific Coast tick fever, caused by Rickettsia rickettsii subspecies californica (formerly Rickettsia species 364D)
Rickettsialpox, caused by Rickettsia akari
Spotted fevers can range from mild to life-threatening. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for all spotted fever infections.
Signs and symptoms
The first sign of many spotted fevers (including Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, or rickettsialpox) is generally a dark scab at the site of tick or mite bite, known as an eschar. Eschars usually develop a few days to a week following the bite of an infected tick or mite.
Several days after an eschar develops, patients can develop other signs and symptoms.
Signs and symptoms can include:
Fever
Headache
Rash
Muscle aches
R. parkeri rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, and rickettsialpox are less severe than RMSF; however, it can be difficult to distinguish between RMSF and other spotted fevers, especially during early stages of these diseases. Ticks are typically found in grassy or wooded environments. See your healthcare provider if you become ill after having been bitten by a tick, or having spent time in areas where ticks may live. Rickettsialpox is spread by mites carried by the common house mouse. Be sure to mention any time spent in areas where mice may be found.
Causes
Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, caused by infection with R. parkeri, is spread by the Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum, which is distributed primarily in the southeastern United States, with focal populations in the northeastern, midwestern, and southwestern United States.
Pacific Coast tick fever is caused by the bacteria R. rickettsii subsp. californica (previously referred to as Rickettsia sp. 364D). Pacific Coast tick fever is spread by the bite of infected Pacific Coast ticks, Dermacentor occidentalis, which can be found along the western coastline in California, Oregon, and Washington.
Rickettsialpox is caused by R. akari. Unlike the other spotted fevers described here, R. akari is spread through the bite of infected mouse mites (Liponyssoides sanguineus). Cases occur occasionally throughout the United States, but are most often reported out of the northeastern United States, particularly New York City.
Prevention
Prevent spotted fever illness by preventing tick bites, preventing ticks on your pets, and preventing ticks in your yard. Prevent rickettsialpox by controlling rodent infestations.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Tick Bites
Testing and diagnosis
The signs and symptoms of spotted fevers are similar to those of many other diseases. See your healthcare provider if you develop the signs and symptoms of spotted fevers.
Be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you become ill and have recently been bitten by a tick, exposed to mice, or have spent time in areas where ticks or mice may be found.
Your healthcare provider may order certain blood tests to look for evidence of spotted fever infection.
The results of these tests can take weeks. If your healthcare provider thinks your illness might be a spotted fever, they should recommend antibiotic treatment before results are available.
Treatment
Some spotted fevers are not life-threatening and can resolve over time, even without treatment. For others, especially RMSF, early treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline can be lifesaving.
Doxycycline is the recommended antibiotic treatment for all spotted fevers, including RMSF in adults and children of all ages.

Ear Infection Basics
KEY POINTS
Is your child's ear hurting? It could be an ear infection.
Some ear infections, in particular some middle ear infections, need antibiotic treatment, but many can get better without antibiotics. Talk to your child's healthcare provider about the best treatment.
Overview
Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections. There are different types of ear infections.
Middle ear infection (acute otitis media) is an infection in the middle ear.
Otitis media with effusion is another condition that affects the middle ear.
Occurs when fluid builds up in the middle ear without causing an infection.
Does not cause fever, ear pain, or pus build-up in the middle ear.
Swimmer's ear is an infection in the outer ear canal.
Different from a middle ear infection.
For more information, visit ""Swimmer's Ear"" (Otitis Externa)
A healthy ear including outer, middle, and inner ear. An infected ear showing inflammation and fluid in the ear.
Signs and symptoms
Ear pain
Fever
Fussiness or irritability
Rubbing or tugging at an ear
Difficulty sleeping
Causes
Bacteria, like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (nontypeable), are the two most common bacteria causing middle ear infection.
Viruses, like those that cause colds can cause middle ear infection.
Prevention
Help prevent ear infections by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy:
Receive recommended vaccines, such as flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine.
Pneumococcal vaccine protects against a common cause of middle ear infections, Streptococcus pneumonia.
Clean your hands.
Breastfeed exclusively until your baby is 6 months old and continue to breastfeed for at least 12 months.
Don't smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.
Dry your ears thoroughly after swimming.
When to seek medical care
A fever of 102.2°F (39°C) or higher.
Pus, discharge, or fluid coming from the ear.
Worsening symptoms.
Symptoms of a middle ear infection that last for more than 2–3 days.
Hearing loss.
This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning.
Talk to a healthcare provider right away
If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.
Diagnosis
A healthcare provider can diagnose a middle ear infection by asking about symptoms and examining your child. They will look inside your child's ear to examine the eardrum and look for pus in the middle ear.
Treatment
Talk to your child's healthcare provider about the best treatment. The body's immune system can often fight off middle ear infection on its own.
Sometimes you do not need antibiotics for middle ear infections.
Severe middle ear infections or infections that last longer than 2–3 days need antibiotics right away.
For mild middle ear infection, your healthcare provider might recommend watchful waiting or delayed antibiotic prescribing.
Watchful waiting: Your child's healthcare provider may suggest watching and waiting for 2-3 days to see if your child needs antibiotics. This gives the immune system time to fight off the infection. If your child's symptoms don't improve, the healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic.
Delayed prescribing: Your child's healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic but suggest that you wait 2–3 days before filling the prescription. Your child may recover on their own and may not need the antibiotic.
How to feel better
Rest.
Drink extra water or other fluids.
Take over-the-counter medicines to relieve pain or fever.
These actions can make you feel better, even if you use antibiotics.
Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicines may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they will not cure your illness.
Over-the-counter medicine and children
Carefully read and follow instructions on over-the-counter medicine product labels before giving medicines to children. Healthcare providers do not recommend some over-the-counter medicines for children of certain ages.
Pain relievers:
Children younger than 6 months: only give acetaminophen.
Children 6 months or older: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain.
Cough and cold medicines:
Children younger than 4 years old: do not use over-the-counter cough and cold medicines in young children unless a healthcare provider specifically tells you to. Cough and cold medicines can result in serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects in young children.
Children 4 years or older: discuss with your child's healthcare provider if over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are safe to give to your child.
Ask your healthcare provider about the right dosage of over-the-counter medicines for your child's age and size. Also, tell your child's healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines they are taking.

Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance Reporting

About Waterborne Disease Surveillance
AT A GLANCE
Surveillance is the term for tracking illness and injury. Waterborne disease surveillance provides information that can help prevent future disease and outbreaks while providing important information on how germs, chemicals, or toxins spread, and which types of water are linked to people getting sick.
Importance of outbreak investigations
Although we enjoy safe drinking and recreational water in the United States, waterborne diseases still pose a threat to our health and productivity. Water contaminated with germs, chemicals, or toxins can lead to waterborne illness if you drink it, breathe it in, or it touches your skin, eyes, ears, or other mucous membranes. By collecting data on the types of water, water systems, settings, and agents (what spreads the disease) that are linked to waterborne illness, we improve our understanding of waterborne illnesses and can better guide prevention efforts.
Outbreak investigations help us learn more about the causes of outbreaks. Officials can learn what germs are causing waterborne illness, what types of water are involved, and what groups of people become ill. This knowledge can be used to control an outbreak and prevent additional illnesses. Outbreak surveillance enables public health agencies to learn lessons from these investigations to develop recommendations on how to prevent similar outbreaks from happening in the future.
Many of the germs that are spread by water can also be spread in other ways, including by eating contaminated food or by contact with an ill person or animal. People come in contact with water often each day, making it even harder to know which exposure might have made a person sick. Finally, it can take several days or even weeks to become ill after being exposed to a germ, making it difficult to pinpoint the place and time of exposure. Without an outbreak investigation, it can be difficult or impossible to link illnesses to water.
When a group of people become ill at the same time, an investigation that collects information on timing and location of exposures and illnesses (known as an epidemiologic investigation) can help determine where and when the outbreak started and what caused it. An outbreak investigation can sometimes identify a direct link between the illnesses and contaminated water and might identify the type of water, systems, or settings involved. This information is difficult to gather outside of an outbreak (such as with individual infections).
Detecting/Investigating waterborne diseases and outbreaks
Waterborne disease outbreak definition
For an event to be defined as a waterborne disease outbreak
Two or more people must be linked epidemiologically by time, location of exposure to water, and type of illness, and
This epidemiologic evidence must implicate water as the probable source of illness.
Environmental evidence implicating water as the source of infection (for example, water samples testing positive for germs) can strengthen evidence in a public health investigation, but the investigation must find an epidemiologic link between the illnesses and water for an event to be considered a waterborne disease outbreak.
Tracking disease
Public health officials have been tracking waterborne disease in the United States for more than 100 years. CDC has been overseeing national waterborne disease and outbreak tracking since 1971.
Surveillance data help guide efforts to reduce and prevent future outbreaks. Waterborne disease surveillance data have supported national efforts to develop drinking water regulations and have provided guidance for recreational water activities, such as CDC's Healthy Swimming program.
The national Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System (WBDOSS) collects data on waterborne disease and outbreaks associated with recreational water, drinking water, and environmental and undetermined exposures to water. The system collects data on the number of outbreak-associated illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths; agents; implicated types of water; water systems; and water settings. WBDOSS also collects information on single cases of waterborne illness caused by certain types of chemicals or germs.
Investigating and reporting
Investigating outbreaks
Public health officials investigate outbreaks to control them, to prevent additional illnesses, and to learn how to prevent similar outbreaks from happening. Anyone who suspects an outbreak is occurring should contact their local or state health department.
The 8 steps in an outbreak investigation are:
DETECT a possible outbreak
DEFINE and FIND cases
GENERATE hypotheses
TEST hypotheses using epidemiology, clinical data, and environmental investigation
IDENTIFY source of outbreak
CONTROL outbreak through remediation and outreach
DECIDE outbreak is over
PREVENT future outbreaks through summarizing, interpreting, and reporting findings
Several steps may happen at the same time in an outbreak investigation. Once a waterborne disease outbreak investigation ends, public health departments report outbreaks to WBDOSS.

Reporting outbreaks
Waterborne disease outbreaks became nationally notifiable in the United States in 2009. Public health agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Freely Associated States have primary responsibility for identifying and investigating waterborne outbreaks and reporting outbreaks voluntarily to CDC. From 1971 to 2008, outbreaks were reported using a paper form. Since 2009, outbreaks have been reported electronically through CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS).
See also Agricultural Water Outbreak Investigation Tools.
National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS)
The National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) is a web-based platform used by local, state, and territorial health departments in the United States to report all waterborne, foodborne, and enteric (intestinal) disease outbreaks to CDC.

What is OutbreakNet Enhanced
OutbreakNet Enhanced (OBNE) is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) program that started in August 2015. OutbreakNet Enhanced supports state and local health departments improve their capacity to detect, investigate, control, and respond to enteric disease outbreaks.
OutbreakNet Enhanced sites work together and with CDC to share experiences and insights to improve enteric disease outbreak response. Outbreaknet Enhanced activities focus on improving detection and rapid interviewing of cases of
Salmonella
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)
Listeria
Pathogens that demonstrate antimicrobial resistance
Why it's important
Each year in the United States foodborne diseases cause:1
1 in 6 Americans (or about 48 million people) to become ill1
128,000 hospitalizations1
3,000 deaths1
Fast and effective outbreak investigations are needed to identify and remove contaminated food from the market to prevent additional illnesses. Identifying contaminated foods and learning how the contamination happened also help public health officials prevent similar outbreaks in the future. However, most health departments lack the resources to conduct comprehensive enteric disease surveillance and rapid, coordinated outbreak detection and response.
Program priorities
OutbreakNet Enhanced sites improve enteric disease outbreak detection and response by:
Hiring additional staff and students to conduct faster and more complete interviews for all laboratory-confirmed cases of Listeria, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157 (STEC), and Salmonella as well as any cases of enteric disease with pathogens that demonstrate antimicrobial resistance. Additional staff and students also increase the capacity for faster and more complete review of surveillance data and improved data sharing.
Incorporating performance measures into their work plans. These measures are used to conduct process evaluations and identify areas for improvement in enteric disease investigations. Using the System for Enteric Disease Response, Investigation, and Coordination (SEDRIC), and the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) to improve multistate outbreak collaboration and the timeliness and completeness of enteric disease outbreak reporting.
Working with an Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence (Food Safety CoEs) to complete a project to improve outbreak surveillance and response in its jurisdiction. Each OutbreakNet Enhanced site chooses projects based on their needs and develops a partnership with a CoE based on its areas of expertise.
Attending trainings and conferences to stay current on the latest developments and improvements in enteric disease surveillance and outbreak investigation.
Outcomes
OutbreakNet Enhanced sites collaborated with CDC staff to set performance metrics for the program. OBNE metrics are based on measures from the FoodCORE and the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response (CIFOR
). These metrics are primarily process-based and are designed to measure timeliness and completeness of laboratory and epidemiologic aspects of outbreak investigations. By collecting and reviewing performance data, sites are able to identify gaps in their processes and develop targeted strategies for improvement.

Preventing Childhood Obesity: 6 Things Families Can Do
KEY POINTS
Childhood obesity is a complex disease with many contributing factors, including genetics, eating patterns, physical activity levels, and sleep routines. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and other health issues. Although there is no one solution, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits.
Why it matters
About 1 in 5 American children have obesity. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure.
Obesity also has an impact on medical costs. Compared to children with healthy weight, total medical expenditures for children with severe obesity are $909 higher each year.
Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for stroke, many types of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death, and mental illness, such as clinical depression and anxiety.
Factors that influence obesity include genetics, eating patterns, physical activity levels, access to health care, and sleep routines. Also, conditions where we live, learn, work, and play can make healthy eating and getting enough physical activity difficult.
Though there is no one solution to addressing obesity, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits at home.
Here are ways families can help prevent obesity.
1. Model a healthy eating pattern
Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are often less expensive than fresh and are still good for you. Look for low sodium or no salt added vegetables and fruits packed in 100% fruit juice.
Adopting healthy eating patterns as a family helps children reach and maintain a healthy weight as they age. Eating a variety of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, lean protein foods, and low-fat and fat-free dairy products follows nutrition guidelines
and sets children and adults up for optimal health.
Help kids rethink their drink by replacing sugary drinks, such as soda, fruit drinks, and flavored milk, with water, 100% juice, or plain low-fat milk.
Hunger Hotline
For information about meal sites, food banks, and other services near you, call 1-866-3-HUNGRY (or 1-877-8-HAMBRE for Spanish).
Hours: 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET, Monday – Friday.
2. Move more as a family
Physically active youth have stronger muscles and bones, better cardiovascular fitness, and lower body fat than those who are inactive. Children aged 3–5 years should be physically active throughout the day. Children aged 6–17 years need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.
Help your children move more
and meet the physical activity recommendations by making it a family affair. Walking the family pet before and after school, riding bikes, and having races in the yard all count toward physical activity. Active chores, such as washing the car, vacuuming a room, or raking leaves, also count.
3. Set consistent sleep routines
Good sleep helps prevent type 2 diabetes, obesity, injuries, and problems with attention and behavior. Children who don't get enough sleep are at risk for unhealthy weight gain. Researchers are still trying to learn how sleep is linked to weight gain. Some reasons might include that lack of sleep can cause a child to eat more or to be less physically active because of to lack of energy.
Preschoolers need 10–13 hours of sleep per day, including naps. Children 6–12 years old need 9–12 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night, and youth 13–17 need 8–10 hours. Staying with a consistent sleep schedule, including on weekends, can help children sleep better.

4. Replace screen time with family time
During childhood, too much screen time can lead to poor sleep, weight gain, lower grades in school, and poor mental health. Reducing screen time can free up time for family activities and can remove cues to eat unhealthy food.
Turning off screens an hour before bed and removing screens from children's bedrooms can help reduce screen time and improve sleep. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends creating a family media plan
with examples of ways to reduce screen time.
5. Support obesity prevention in Early Care and Education
About 3 in 5 children birth through age 5 who are not yet in kindergarten are in a nonparental care arrangement at least once a week. The number of children in Early care and education (ECE) settings makes them among the best places outside the home to help young children build a foundation for healthy living. High-quality ECE programming can have a positive impact on a child's social-emotional wellbeing, educational achievement, health, and socioeconomic outcomes later in life.
Look for ECE settings supporting healthy infant feeding, healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time limits. When looking for ECE programs for your child, ask about policies and practices related to breastfeeding and feeding breast milk to infants, nutrition standards for the food served, access to outdoor physical activity during the day, and how much time the child will spend daily in front of a screen.
6. Find a Family Healthy Weight Program
If you are concerned about your child's weight, talk with their health care provider. They can assess the health risks related to excess weight. If your child has overweight or obesity, your health care provider may refer you to a family healthy weight program (FHWP). FHWPs are comprehensive, family-based lifestyle change programs to help children who are overweight or who have obesity make progress toward a healthier weight through positive behavior changes.

About Pinworm Infection
KEY POINTS
Pinworm infection is caused by small, thin, white parasitic roundworms.
Anyone can get pinworm infection, but it primarily affects children, people in long-term care facilities, and household members and caretakers of persons with pinworm infections.
Medication, handwashing, and good hygiene are the best ways to stop the spread of pinworm.
Overview
Pinworms are a type of parasitic roundworm that can infect your intestines. Parasites are organisms (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Pinworm infection causes itching around the anus (butthole). Anyone can get a pinworm infection, but it usually affects children, people living with or caring for children, and people living in long-term care facilities or institutional settings. Pinworm infection is preventable and treatable.
On average, a single pinworm is about the size of a staple. The scientific name for a pinworm is Enterobius vermicularis and some healthcare providers may use the terms enterobiasis or oxyuriasis to refer to pinworm infection.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of pinworm infection are usually mild, and some people have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, it is typically itching around the anus. Female pinworms lay their eggs at night on the skin around the anus, which can cause the skin to itch. Some infected people have difficulty sleeping or restlessness. Some infected people have reported abdominal pain. Occasionally, pinworms can move to the vaginal area, causing irritation and inflammation. Repeated scratching can make the skin red and puffy and lead to bacterial skin infections—in addition to the pinworm infection.
Risk factors
Pinworm infection occurs worldwide. Pinworms can infect anyone, in any setting, and are the most common worm infection in the United States. Pinworm infection occurs most commonly among
School-aged and preschool-aged children,
People in institutional settings, and
Household members and caretakers of people with pinworm infection.
Pinworm infections often occur in more than one person in a household. It is common to see multiple infections in institutional and childcare settings as pinworms spread easily.
How it spreads
While an infected person sleeps, female pinworms leave the intestine through the anus and deposit their eggs on the surrounding skin. Two to three hours after pinworms lay their eggs, the eggs become capable of infecting other people who accidentally swallow them. The eggs can easily infect another person, especially caretakers or close contacts of infected children or adults:
If, after they touch an infected area around the anus, or get eggs under their fingernails, they then touch their mouth.
After pinworm eggs get onto diapers, clothes, bedding, food, or other items, the worms could then make it from the object to someone's mouth. (If not properly washed or cleaned, pinworm eggs can survive 2 – 3 weeks on objects.)
When pinworm eggs, which are tiny, float through the air and someone breaths them in then swallows them (rare).
Prevention
Washing your hands with soap and warm water is the best way to prevent pinworm infection. This is especially important after
Using the toilet
Changing diapers, and
Touching people who have pinworm or handling items they have used.
Always wash your hands before handling food. Teach children the importance of washing their hands thoroughly and often.
Repeated infections are common. Treat everyone—people infected with pinworms, their caretakers, and members of their household—with the same two-dose treatment. Learn more prevention methods and how to prevent multiple infections and spread.
Diagnosis
If you or someone you know is showing signs of a pinworm infection, speak with your healthcare provider. There are three ways, with your help, your provider can diagnose pinworm infection:
Look for pinworms around the anus 2 – 3 hours after the who may be infected person goes to sleep.
Conduct a ""tape test"" to collect possible pinworm eggs around the anus.
Look at samples from under the fingernails of the person who may have pinworms.
Learn more about the specific steps to take on the Diagnosis page.
Treatment and recovery
There are medications, both over the counter and prescription, that can treat pinworm infection. If you or someone you care for are experiencing symptoms of pinworm infection, talk with your healthcare provider to be properly diagnosed.
Treat everyone in the same household and caregivers of the person diagnosed with pinworms at the same time. Treatment involves two doses of medication with the second dose given two weeks after the first dose. The medications kill worms but cannot kill eggs. The second dose is important to prevent infection by newly hatched adult worms that were not killed by the first treatment because they were still eggs.
